  The road led in the general direction of Lee's army and Harry knew  that if he followed it long enough he was bound to reach his commander,  but the two words &#8220;long enough&#8221; might defeat everything. Undoubtedly a  Federal force was near, or the farmer and his wife would not be  signaling from the roof of their house.
  A plucky couple they were and he gave them all credit, but he was  aware that while he had secured breakfast from them they had put the  wolves upon his trail. There were high hills on both the right and left  of the road, and, as he galloped along he examined them through his  glasses for flags answering the signal on the house. But he saw nothing  and the thickness of the forest indicated that even if the signals were  made there it was not likely he could see them.
  Now he wisely restrained the speed of his horse, so full of strength  and spirit that it seemed willing to run on forever, and brought him  down to a walk. He had an idea that he would soon be pursued, and then  a fresh horse would be worth a dozen tired ones.
  The road continued to run between high, forested hills, splendid for  ambush, and Harry saw what a danger it was not to have knowledge of the  country. He understood how the Union forces in the South were so often  at a loss on ground that was strange to them.
  The road now curved a little to the left, and a few hundred yards  ahead another from the east merged with it. Along this road the forest  was thinner, and upon it, but some distance away, he saw bobbing heads  in caps, twenty, perhaps, in number. He knew at once that they were the  enemy, called by the signal, and leaning forward he spoke in the ear of  his good horse.
  &#8220;You and I haven't known each other long,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but we're good  friends. I paid honest and sufficient money for you, when I could have  ridden away on you without paying a cent. I know you have a powerful  frame and that your speed is great. I really believe you're the fastest  runner in all this part of the state. Now, prove it!&#8221;
  The horse stretched out his neck, and the road flew behind him, his  body working like a mighty machine perfectly attuned, even to its  minutest part. Harry's words had met a true response. He heard a cry on  the cross road, and the bobbing heads came forward much faster. Either  they had seen him or they had heard the swift beat of his horse's  hoofs. Loud shouts arose, but he saw the uniforms of the men, and he  knew that they belonged to the Northern army.
  He went past the junction of the roads, as if he were flying, but he  was not a bit too soon, as he heard the crack of rifles, and bullets  struck in the earth behind him. He knew that they would follow, hang on  persistently, but he had supreme confidence in the speed and strength  of his horse, and youth rode triumphant. It was youth more than  anything else that made him raise himself a little in his saddle, look  back to his pursuers and fling to them a long, taunting cry, just as  Henry Ware more than once had taunted his Indian pursuers before  disappearing in a flight that their swiftest warriors could not match.
  But the little band of Union troopers clung to the chase. They too  had good horses, and they knew that the man before them was a Southern  messenger, and in those hot July days of 1863 all military messages  carried on the roads north of the Potomac were important. The fate of  an army or a nation might turn upon any one of them, and the lieutenant  who led the little Union troop was aware of it. He was a man of  intelligence and a consuming desire to overtake the lone horseman lay  hold of him. He knew, as well as any general, that since Gettysburg the  fate of the South was verily trembling in the balance, and the  slightest weight somewhere might decide the scales. So he resolved to  hang on through everything and the chances were in his favor. It was  his own country. The Federal troops were everywhere, and any moment he  might have aid in cutting off the fugitive.
  When Harry eased his horse's flight he saw the troop, very distant  but still pursuing, and he read the mind of the Union leader. He was  saving his mounts, trailing merely, in the hope that Harry would  exhaust his own horse, after which he and his men would come on at  great speed.
  Harry looked down at his horse and saw that he was heaving with his  great effort. He knew that he had made a mistake in driving him so hard  at first, and with the courage of which only a young veteran would have  been capable he brought the animal almost to a walk, and resolutely  kept him there, while the enemy gained. When they were almost within  rifle shot he increased his speed again, but he did not seek for the  present to increase his gain.
  As long as their bullets could not reach him his horse should merely  go stride for stride with theirs, and when the last stretch was  reached, he would send forward the brave animal at his utmost speed.  His were the true racing tactics drawn from his native state. He had no  doubt of his ability to leave his pursuers far behind when the time  came, but his true danger was from interference. He too knew that many  Union cavalry troops were abroad, and he watched on either flank for  them as he rode on. At the crest of every little hill he swept the  whole country, but as yet he saw nothing but peaceful farmhouses.
  The day was clear and bright, not so warm as its predecessors, and  he calculated by the sun that he was going straight toward Lee. He knew  that a great army always marched slowly, and he was able to reckon with  accuracy just how far the Army of Northern Virginia had come since  Gettysburg. He should reach it in the morning, with full information  about the Potomac, and the best place for a crossing.
  He arrived at the crest of a hill higher than the others, and saw  the Union troop, about a quarter of a mile behind, stop beside a clump  of tall trees. Their action surprised Harry, who had thought they would  never quit as long as they could find his trail. To his further  surprise he saw one of the men dismount and begin to climb the tallest  of the trees. Then he brought his glasses into play.
  He saw the climber go up, up, until he had reached the last bough  that would support him. Then he drew some thing from his pocket which  he unrolled and began to wave rapidly. It was a flag and through his  powerful glasses Harry clearly saw the Stars and Stripes. It was  evident that they were signaling, but when one signals one usually  signals to somebody. His breath shortened for a moment. He believed  that the man in the tree was talking with his flag about the fugitive.  Where was the one to whom he was talking?
  He looked to both left and right, searching the fields and the  forests, and saw nothing. Then, as he was sweeping his glasses again in  a half curve he caught a glimpse of something straight ahead that made  the great pulse in his throat beat hard. About a mile in front of him  another man in a tree was waving a flag and beneath the tree were  horsemen.
  Harry knew now that the two flags were talking about the Confederate  messenger between. The one behind said: &#8220;Look out! He's young, riding a  bay horse and he's coming directly toward you,&#8221; to which the one in  front replied, &#8220;We're waiting. He can't escape us. There are fields  with high fences on either side of the road and if he manages to break  through the fence he's an easy capture in the soft and muddy ground  there.&#8221;
  Harry thought hard and fast, while the two flags talked so  contemptuously about him. The fields were unquestionably deep with mud  from the heavy rains, but he must try them. It was lucky that he had  seen the flags while both forces were out of rifle shot. He decided for  the western side, sprang from his horse and threw down a few rails. In  a half minute he was back on his horse, leaped him over the fence, and  struck across the field.
  It had been lately plowed and the going was uncommonly heavy. It  would be just as heavy however for his pursuers, and his luck in seeing  their signals would put him out of range before they reached the field.  But it was a wide field and his horse's feet sank so deep in the mud  that he dismounted and led him. When he was two-thirds of the way  across a shout told him that the two forces had met, and had discovered  the ruse of the fugitive. It did not take much intelligence to  understand what he had done, because he was yet in plain sight, and a  few of the cavalrymen took pot shots at him, their bullets falling far  short. Harry in his excited condition laughed at these attempts. Almost  anything was a triumph now. He shook his fist at them and regretted  that he could not send back a defiant shot.
  The cavalrymen conferred a little. Then a part pursued across the  field, and two detachments rode along its side, one to the north and  the other to the south. Harry understood. If the mud held him back  sufficiently they might pass around the field and catch him on the  other side. He continued to lead his horse, encouraging him with words  of entreaty and praise.
  &#8220;Come on!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;You won't let a little mud bother you. You  wouldn't let yourself be overtaken by a lot of half-bred horses not fit  to associate with you?&#8221;
  The brave animal responded nobly, and what had been the far edge of  the field was rapidly coming nearer. Beyond it lay woods. But the  flanking movement threatened. The two detachments were passing around  the field on firm ground, and Harry knew that he and his good horse  must hasten. He talked to him continually, boasting about him, and  together they reached the fence, which he threw down in all haste. Then  he led his weary horse out of the mud, sprang upon his back and  galloped into the bushes.
  He knew that the horses passing around the field on firm ground  would be fresh, and that he must find temporary hiding, at least as  soon as he could. He was in deep thickets now and he galloped on,  careless how the bushes scratched him and tore his uniform. The Union  cavalry would surely follow, but he wanted a little breathing time for  his horse, and in eight or ten minutes he stopped in the dense  undergrowth. The horse panted so hard that any one near would have  heard him, but there was no other sound in the thicket. The rest was  valuable for both. Harry was able to concentrate his mind and consider,  while the panting of the horse gradually ceased, and he breathed with  regularity. The young lieutenant patted him on the nose and whispered  to him consolingly.
  &#8220;Good, old boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you've brought me safely so far. I knew  that I could trust you.&#8221;
  Then he stood quite still, with his hand stroking the horse's nose  to keep him silent. He had heard the first sounds of search. To his  right was the distant beat of hoofs and men's voices. Evidently they  were going to make a thorough search for him, and he decided to resume  his flight, even at the risk of being heard.
  He led the horse again, because the forest was so dense that one  could scarcely ride in it, and he thought, for a while, that he had  thrown off the pursuit, but the voices came again, and now on his left.  They had never relaxed the hunt for an instant. They had a good leader,  and Harry admitted that in his place he would have done the same.
  The country grew rougher, being so steep and hilly that it was not  easy of cultivation, and hence remained clothed in dense forest and  undergrowth. Twice more Harry heard the sound of pursuing voices and  hoofs, and then the noise of running water came to his ears. Twenty  yards farther and he came to a creek flowing between high banks, on  which the forest grew so densely that the sun was scarcely able to  reach the water below.
  The creek at first seemed to be a bar to his advance, but thinking  it over he led his horse carefully down into the stream, mounted him  and rode with the current, which was not more than a foot deep.  Fortunately the creek had a soft bottom and there was no ringing of  hoofs on stones.
  He went slowly, lest the water splash too much, and kept a wary  watch on the banks above, which were growing higher. He did not know  where the creek led, but it offered both a road and concealment, and it  seemed that Providence had put it there for his especial help.
  He rode in the bed of the stream fully an hour, and then emerged  from the hills into a level and comparatively bare country. It was a  region utterly unknown to him, but with his splendid idea of direction  and the sun to guide him he knew his straight course to Lee. The  country before him seemed to be given up wholly to grass, as he noticed  neither corn nor wheat. He saw several farm hands, but decided to keep  away from them. That was no country for the practice of horsemanship by  a lone Confederate soldier, nor did he like to be the fox in a fox  hunt.
  Yet the fox he was. He chose a narrow road leading between cedars,  and when he had advanced upon it a few hundred yards he heard the sound  of a trumpet behind him, and at the edge of the woods that he had left.  He saw horsemen in blue emerging and he had no doubt that they were the  same men whom he had eluded in the thickets.
  &#8220;Their pursuit of me is getting to be a habit,&#8221; he said to himself  with the most intense annoyance. &#8220;It's a good thing, my brave horse,  that you've had a long rest.&#8221;
  He shook up the reins and began to gallop. He heard a faint shout in  the distance and saw the troopers in pursuit. But he did not fear them  now. Numerous fences would prevent them from flanking him, and he saw  that the road led on, straight and level. He shook the reins again and  the horse lengthened his stride.
  He felt so exultant that he laughed. It would be easy enough now to  distance this Union troop. Then the laugh died suddenly on his lips. A  bullet whistled so near his face that it almost took away his breath.  An elderly farmer standing in his own door had fired it, and Harry  snatched one of the pistols from his own belt, remembering then with  rage that it could not be fired. He shouted to his horse and made him  run faster.
  A bullet struck the pommel of his saddle and glanced off. A boy in  an orchard had fired it. A load of bird-shot, a handful it seemed to  Harry, flew about his ears. A bent old man who ought to have been  sitting on a porch in a rocking chair had discharged it from the edge  of a wood. A squirrel hunter on a hill took a pot shot at him and  missed.
  Harry was furious with anger. Decidedly this was no place for a  visitor from the South. He did not detect the faintest sign of  hospitality. Men and women alike seemed to dislike him. A powerful  virago hurled a stone at his head, which would have struck him  senseless had it not missed, and a farmer standing by a fence had a  shotgun cocked and ready to be fired as he passed, but Harry, snatching  one of the useless pistols from his belt, hurled it at him with all his  might. It struck the man a glancing blow on the head, felling him as if  he had been shot, and then Harry, thinking quickly, acted with equal  quickness.
  He reined in his horse with such suddenness that he nearly shot from  the saddle. Then he leaped down, seized the shotgun from under the  hands of the fallen man, sprang on his horse and was away again,  sending back a cry of defiance.
  Harry had never before in his life been so furious. To be hunted  thus by a whole countryside, as if he were a mad dog, was intolerable.  It was not only a threat to one's life, it was also an insult to one's  dignity to be treated as an animal. Although he was armed now the  insult continued. The call of the trumpet sounded almost without  ceasing, and the Union troopers uttered many shouts as do those who  chase the fox, although Harry knew that their cries were intended to  rouse the farmers who might head him off.
  The chase grew hotter, but he felt better with the shotgun. It was a  fine double-barreled weapon of the latest make, and he hoped that it  was loaded with buckshot. He was a sharpshooter, and he could give a  good account of any one who came too near.
  Yet with the trumpet shrilling continually behind him the huntsmen  gathered fast on either flank. It was yet the day when nearly every  house in America, outside a town, contained a rifle, and bullets fired  from a distance began to patter around Harry and his horse. The  riflemen were too far away to be reached with the shotgun, and it  seemed inevitable to him that in time a bullet would strike him. He was  truly the fox, and he knew that nothing could save him but forest.
  It was in his favor that the country was so broken and wooded so  heavily, and fixing his eyes on trees a half-mile ahead he raced for  them. If none of this yelling pack dragged him down he felt sure that  he might escape again in the forest. The trees swiftly came nearer, but  the shots on either flank increased. More than ever he felt like the  fox with the hounds all about him, and just one slender chance to reach  the burrow ahead.
  He felt his horse shake and knew that he had been hit. Yet the brave  animal ran on as well as ever, despite the triumphant shout behind,  which showed that he must be leaving a trail of blood. But the woods,  thick and inviting, were near, and he believed that he would reach  them. The horse shook again, much more violently than before, and then  fell to his knees. Harry leaped off, still clutching the shotgun, just  as the brave animal fell over on his side and began to breathe out his  life.
  He heard again that shout of triumph, but he was one who never gave  up. He had alighted easily on his feet. The trees were not more than  fifteen yards away and he disappeared among them as bullets clipped  bark and twigs about him.
  He breathed a deep sigh of thankfulness when he entered the forest.  It was so dense, and there was so much undergrowth that the horsemen  could not follow him there. If they came on foot, and spread out, as  they must, to hunt him, he had the double-barreled shotgun and it was a  deadly weapon. The fox had suddenly become the panther, alert,  powerful, armed with claws that killed.
  Harry went deep into the thickets before he sat down. He had no  doubt that they would follow him, but at present he was out of their  sight and hearing. He felt a mixture of elation and sadness, elation  over his temporary escape, and sadness over the loss of his gallant  horse. But one could not dwell long on regrets at such a time, and,  advancing a little farther, he sat down among the densest bushes that  he could find with the shotgun across his knees.
  Now Harry saw that the horse had really done all that it was  possible for him to do. He had brought him to the wood, and within he  would have been a drawback. A man on foot could conceal himself far  more easily. Everything favored him. There were bushes and vines  everywhere and he could be hidden like a deer in its covert.
  He looked up at the sun shining through the tops of the trees and  saw that he had kept to his true course. His flight had taken him  directly toward Lee at a much faster pace than he would have come  otherwise. The enemy had driven him on his errand at double speed. He  felt that he could spare a little time now, while he waited to see what  the pursuit would do.
  His feeling of exultation was now unalloyed. Deep in the forest with  his foes looking for him in vain, the spirit of Henry Ware was once  more strong within him. He was the reincarnation of the great hunter.  He lay so still, clasping the shotgun, that the little creatures of the  woods were deceived. A squirrel ran up the trunk of an oak six feet  away, and stood fearlessly in a fork with his bushy tail curved over  his back. A small gray bird perched on a bough just over Harry's head  and poured out a volume of song. Farther away sounded the tap tap of a  woodpecker on the bark of a dead tree.
  Harry, although he did not move, was watching and listening with  intense concentration, but his ears now would be his surest signals. He  could not see deep in the thickets, but he could hear any movement in  the underbrush a hundred yards away. So far there was nothing but the  hopping of a rabbit. The bird over his head sang on. There was no wind  among the branches, not even the flutter of leaves to distract his  attention from anything that might come on the ground.
  He rejoiced in this period of rest, of the nerves, rather than  purely physical. He had been keyed so high that now he relaxed  entirely, and soon lay perfectly flat, but with the shotgun still  clasped in his arms. He had a soft couch. Under him were the dead  leaves of last year, and over him was the pleasant gloom of thick  foliage, already turning brown. The bird sang on. His clear and  beautiful note came from a point directly over his head, but Harry  could not see his tiny body among the leaves. He became, for a little  while, more interested in trying to see him than in hearing his  pursuers.
  It was annoying that such a volume of sound should come from a body  that could be hidden by a leaf. If a man could shout in proportion to  his own size he might be heard eight to ten miles away. It was an  interesting speculation and he pursued it. While he was pursuing it his  mind relaxed more and more and traveled farther and farther away from  his flight and hiding. Then his heavy eyelids pulled down, and, while  his pursuers yet searched the thickets for him, he slept.
  But his other self, which men had thought of as far back as  Socrates, kept guard. When he had slept an hour a tiny voice in his  ear, no louder than the ticking of a watch, told him to awake, that  danger was near. He obeyed the call, sleep was lifted from him and he  opened his eyes. But with inherited caution he did not move. He still  lay flat in his covert, trusting to his ears, and did not make a leaf  move about him.
  His ears told him that leaves were rustling not very far away, not  more than a hundred feet. His power of hearing was great, and the  forest seemed to make it uncommonly sensitive and delicate.
  He knew that the rustling of the leaves was made by a man walking.  By and by he heard his footfalls, and he knew that he wore heavy boots,  or his feet would not have crushed down in such a decisive manner. He  was looking for something, too, because the footfalls did not go  straight on, but veered about.
  Harry was well aware that it was a Union soldier, and that he was  the object of his search. He was a clumsy man, not used to forests,  because Harry heard him stumble twice, when his feet caught on vines.  Nor was any comrade near, or he would have called to him for the sake  of companionship. Harry judged that he was originally a mill hand, and  he did not feel the least alarm about him, laughing a little at his  clumsiness and awkwardness, as he trod heavily among the bushes,  tripped again on the vines, and came so near falling that he could hear  the rifle rattle when it struck a tree. He did not have the slightest  fear of the man, and at last, raising his head, he took a look.
  All his surmises were justified. He saw a great hulking youth of  heavy and dull countenance, carrying a rifle awkwardly, his place  obviously around some town and not in the depths of a forest, looking  for a wary enemy, who knew more of the wilderness than he could ever  learn in all his life. Harry saw that he was perspiring freely and that  he looked more like the hunted than the hunter. His eyes expressed  bewilderment. He was obviously lonely and apprehensive, not because he  was a coward, but because the situation was so strange to him.
  Besides his rifle he carried a large knapsack, so much distended  that Harry knew it to be full of food. It was this that decided him. A  soldier, like an army, must travel on his stomach, and he wanted that  knapsack. Moreover he meant to get it. He leveled his shotgun and  called in a low tone, but a tone so sharp that it could be heard  distinctly by the one to whom it was addressed:
  &#8220;Throw up your hands at once!&#8221;
  The man threw them up so abruptly that the rifle fell from his  shoulder into the bushes, and he turned around, staring face toward the  point from which the command had come. Harry saw at once that he was of  foreign birth, probably. The features inclined to the Slav type,  although Slavs were not then common in this country, even in the mill  towns of the North.
  &#8220;Are you an American?&#8221; asked Harry, standing up.
  &#8220;All but two years of my life.&#8221;
  &#8220;The first two years then, as I see you speak good English. What's  your name?&#8221;
  &#8220;Michael Stanislav.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you think that anybody named Michael Stanislav has the right to  interfere in the quarrel of the Northern and Southern states? Don't the  Stanislavs have trouble enough in the country where the Stanislavs  grow?&#8221;
  The big youth stared at him without understanding.
  &#8220;Do you know who I am?&#8221; asked Harry, severely.
  &#8220;The running rebel that we all look for.&#8221;
  &#8220;Rebels don't run. Besides, there are no rebels. Anyway I'm not the  man you're looking for. My name is Robin Hood.&#8221;
  &#8220;Robin Hood?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, Robin Hood! Didn't you ever hear of him?&#8221;
  &#8220;Never.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you have the honor of hearing of him and meeting him at the  same time. As I said, my name is Robin Hood and my trade is that of a  benevolent robber. I lie around in the greenwood, and I don't work.  I've a lot of followers, Friar Tuck and others, but they're away for a  while. They're as much opposed to work as I am. That's why they're my  followers. We're the friends of the poor, because they have nothing we  want, and we're the enemies of the rich because they have a lot we do  want and that we often take. Still, we couldn't get along very well, if  there were no rich for us to rob. It's like taking sugar water from a  maple tree. We won't take too much, because it would kill the tree and  we want to take its sugar water again, and many times. Do you  understand?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied the big youth, but Harry knew he didn't. Harry  meanwhile was listening keenly to all that was passing in the forest,  and he was sure that no other soldier had wandered near. It was perhaps  partly a feeling of loneliness on his own part that caused him to  linger in his talk with Michael Stanislav.
  &#8220;Michael,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;you appreciate our respective positions,  don't you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Ah!&#8221; said Michael, in a puzzled voice.
  &#8220;I've explained carefully to you that I'm Robin Hood, and you at the  present moment represent the rich.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not rich. Before I turn soldier I work in a mill at  Bridgeport.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's all very well, but you can't get out of it by referring to  your past. Just now you are a proxy of the rich, and it's my duty to  rob you.&#8221;
  The mouth of the big fellow expanded into a wide grin.
  &#8220;You won't rob me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have not a cent.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I'm going to rob you just the same. Don't you dare to drop a  hand toward the pistols in your belt. If you do I'll blow your head  off. I'm covering you with a double-barreled shotgun. Each barrel  contains about twenty buckshot, and at close range their blast would be  so terrific that you'd make an awful looking corpse.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hold up my hands a long time. Don't want to be any kind of a  corpse.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's the good boy. Steady now. Don't move a muscle. I'm going to  rob you. It's a brief and painless operation, much easier than pulling  a tooth.&#8221;
  He deftly removed the two pistols and the accompanying ammunition  from the man's belt, placing them in his own. His belt of cartridges he  put on the ground beside the fallen rifle, and then as he felt a glow  of triumph he passed the well-filled knapsack from the stalwart  shoulders of the other to his own shoulders, equally stalwart.
  &#8220;Is everything in it first class, Michael?&#8221; he demanded with much  severity.
  &#8220;The best. Our army feeds well.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's a good thing for you that it's so. Robin Hood is never  satisfied with anything second class, and he's likely to be offended if  you offer it to him. On the whole, Michael, I think I like you and I'm  glad you came this way. But do you care for good advice?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's right. Say 'sir' to me. It pleases my robber's heart. Then,  my advice to you is never again to go into the woods alone. All the  forest looks alike to those who don't know it, and you're lost in a  minute. Besides, it's filled with strange and terrible creatures, Robin  Hood&#8212;that's me, though I have some redeeming qualities&#8212;the  Erymanthean boar, the Hydra-headed monster, Medusa of the snaky locks,  Cyclops, Polyphemus with one awful eye, the deceitful Sirens, the Old  Man of the Mountain, Wodin and Osiris, and, last and most terrible of  all, the Baron Munchausen.&#8221;
  A flicker of fear appeared in the eyes of the captive.
  &#8220;But I'll see that none of these monsters hurt you,&#8221; said Harry  consolingly. &#8220;The open is directly behind you, about a mile. Right  about! Wheel! Well done! Now, you won't see me again, but you'll hear  me giving commands. Forward, march! Quit stumbling! No true forester  ever does! Nor is it necessary for you to run into more than three  trees! Keep going! No, don't curve! Go straight ahead, and remember  that if you look back I shoot!&#8221;
  Michael walked swiftly enough. He deemed that on the whole he had  fared well. The great brigand, Robin Hood, had spared his life and he  had lost nothing. The army would replace his weapons and ammunition and  he was glad enough to escape from that terrible forest, even if he were  driven out of it.
  Harry watched him until he was out of sight, and then picking up the  rifle and belt of cartridges he fled on soundless feet deeper into the  forest. Two or three hundred yards away he stopped and heard a great  shouting. Michael, no longer covered by a gun, had realized that  something untoward had happened to him, and he was calling to his  comrades. Harry did not know whether Michael would still call the man  who had held him up, Robin Hood, nor did he care. He had secured an  excellent rifle which would be much more useful to him than a shotgun,  and his course still led straight toward the point where he should find  Lee's army on the march. He felt that he ought to throw away the  shotgun, as two weapons were heavy, but he could not make up his mind  to do so.
  A hundred yards farther and he heard replies to Michael's shouts,  and then several shots, undoubtedly fired by the Union troops  themselves, as signals of alarm. He laughed to himself. Could such men  as these overtake one who was born to the woods, the great grandson of  Henry Ware, the most gifted of the borderers, who in the woods had not  only a sixth sense, but a seventh as well? And his great grandson had  inherited many of his qualities.
  Harry, in the forest, felt only contempt for these youths of Central  Europe who could not tell one point of the compass from another. He  guided his own course by the sun, and continued at a good pace until he  could hear shouts and shots no longer. Then in the dense woods, where  the shadows made a twilight, he came to a tiny stream flowing from  under a rock. He knelt and drank of the cool water, and then he opened  Michael's knapsack. It was truly well filled, and he ate with deep  content. Then he drank again and rested by the side of the pool.
  As he reflected over his journey Harry concluded that Providence had  watched over him so far, but there was much yet to do before he reached  Lee. Providence had a strange way of watching over a man for a while,  and then letting him go. He would neglect no precaution. The forest  would not continue forever and then he must take his chances in the  open.
  Still burning with the desire to be the first to reach Lee, he put  the rifle and the shotgun on either shoulder, and set off at as rapid a  pace as the thickets would permit. But he soon stopped because a sound  almost like that of a wind, but not a wind, came to his ears. There was  a breeze blowing directly toward him, but he paid no attention to it,  because to him most breezes were pleasant and friendly. But the other  sound had in it a quality that was distinctly sinister like the hissing  of a snake.
  Harry paused in wonder and alarm. All his instincts warned him that  a new danger was at hand. The breath of the wind suddenly grew hot, and  sparks carried by it blew past him. He knew, in an instant, that the  forest was on fire behind him and that tinder dry, it would burn fast  and furious. Changing from a walk to a run, he sped forward as swiftly  as he could, while the flames suddenly sprang high, waved and leaped  forward in chase.
