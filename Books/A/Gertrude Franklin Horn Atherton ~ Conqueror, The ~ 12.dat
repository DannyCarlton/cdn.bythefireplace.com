But although they parted with formal courtesy, it was several nights  before either slept. Rachael went home to her bed and lay down, because  she feared to agitate her mother, but her disposition was to go out and  walk the circuit of the Island, and she rose as soon as she dared, and  climbed to the highest crest behind the house. It was cold there, and  the wind was keen. She sat for hours and stared out at Nevis, who was  rolling up her mists, indifferent to the torment of mortals.    
During the past fortnight she had conceived a certain stern calm, partly  in self-defence, due in part to love for her mother. But since she had  left Hamilton, last night, there had been moments when she had felt  alone in the Universe with him, exalted to such heights of human passion  that she had imagined herself about to become the mother of a new race.  Her genius, which in a later day might have taken the form of mental  creation, concentrated in a supreme capacity for idealized human  passion, and its blind impulse was a reproduction of itself in another  being.    
Were she and Hamilton but the victims of a mighty ego roaming the  Universe in search of a medium for human expression? Were they but  helpless sacrifices, consummately equipped, that the result of their  union might be consummately great? Who shall affirm or deny? The very  commonplaces of life are components of its eternal mystery. We know  absolutely nothing. But we have these facts: that a century and a half  ago, on a tropical island, where, even to common beings, quick and  intense love must seem the most natural thing in the world, this man and  woman met; that the woman, herself born in unhappy conditions, but  beautiful, intellectual, with a character developed far beyond her years  and isolated home by the cruel sufferings of an early marriage, reared  by a woman whose independence and energy had triumphed over the narrow  laws of the Island of her birth, given her courage to snap her fingers  at society--we know that this woman, inevitably remarkable, met and  loved a stranger from the North, so generously endowed that he alone of  all the active and individual men who surrounded her won her heart; and  that the result of their union was one of the stupendous intellects of  the world's history.    
Did any great genius ever come into the world after commonplace  pre-natal conditions? Was a maker of history ever born amidst the  pleasant harmonies of a satisfied domesticity? Of a mother who was less  than remarkable, although she may have escaped being great? Did a woman  with no wildness in her blood ever inform a brain with electric fire?  The students of history know that while many mothers of great men have  been virtuous, none have been commonplace, and few have been happy. And  lest the moralists of my day and country be more prone to outraged  virtue, in reading this story, than were the easy-going folk who  surrounded it, let me hasten to remind them that it all happened close  upon a hundred and fifty years ago, and that the man and woman who gave  them the brain to which they owe the great structure that has made their  country phenomenal among nations, are dust on isles four hundred miles  apart.    
A century and a half ago women indulged in little introspective  analysis. They thought on broad lines, and honestly understood the  strength of their emotions. Moreover, although Mary Wollstonecraft was  unborn and "Emile" unwritten, Individualism was germinating; and what  soil so quickening as the Tropics? Nevertheless, to admit was not to lay  the question, and Rachael passed through many hours of torment before  hers was settled. She was not unhappy, for the intoxication lingered,  and behind the methodical ticking of her reason, stood, calmly awaiting  its time, that sense of the Inevitable which has saved so many brains  from madness. She slept little and rested less, but that sentinel in her  brain prevented the frantic hopelessness which would have possessed her  had she felt herself strong enough to command James Hamilton to leave  the Island.    
She met him several times before the night of her entertainment, and  there were moments when she was filled with terror, for he did not  whisper a reference to the conversation in the Park. Had he thought  better of it? Would he go? Would he conquer himself? Was it but a  passing madness? When these doubts tormented her she was driven to such  a state of jealous fury that she forgot every scruple, and longed only  for the bond which would bind him fast; then reminded herself that she  should be grateful, and endeavoured to be. But one day when he lifted  her to her horse, he kissed her wrist, and again the intoxication of  love went to her head, and this time it remained there. Once they met up  in the hills, where they had been asked with others to take a dish of  tea with Mistress Montgomerie. They sat alone for an hour on one of the  terraces above the house, laughing and chattering like children, then  rode down the hills through the cane-fields together. Again, they met in  the Park, and sat under the banyan tree, discussing the great books they  had read, all of Europe they knew. For a time neither cared to finish  that brief period of exquisite happiness and doubt, where imagination  rules, and the world is unreal and wholly sweet, and they its first to  love.    
The wrenching stage of doubt had passed for Hamilton, but he thought on  the future with profound disquiet. He would have the woman wholly or not  at all, after Mary Fawcett's death; he knew from Dr. Hamilton that it  would occur before the year was out. He had no taste for intrigue. He  wanted a home, and the woman he would have rejoiced to marry was the  woman he expected to love and live with for the rest of his life. Once  or twice the overwhelming sense of responsibility, the certainty of  children, whom he could not legalize, the possible ruin of his worldly  interests, as well as his deep and sincere love for the woman, drove him  almost to the bows of a homeward-bound vessel. But the sure knowledge  that he should return kept him doggedly on St. Christopher. He even had  ceased to explain his infatuation to himself by such excuse as was given  him by her beauty, her grace, her strong yet charming brain. He loved  her, and he would have her if the skies fell.    
It is doubtful if he understood the full force of the attraction between  them. The real energy and deliberation, the unswerving purpose in her  magnetized the weakness at the roots of his ardent, impulsive, but  unstable character. Moreover, in spite of the superlative passion which  he had aroused in her, she lacked the animal magnetism which was his in  abundance. Her oneness was a magnet for his gregariousness and  concentrated it upon herself. That positive quality in him overwhelmed  and intoxicated her; and in intellect he was far more brilliant and far  less profound than herself. His wit and mental nimbleness stung and  pricked the serene layers which she had carefully superimposed in her  own mind to such activities as mingled playfully with his lighter moods  or stimulated him in more intellectual hours. While the future was yet  unbroken and imagination remodelled the face of the world, there were  moments when both were exalted with a sense of completeness, and  terrified, when apart, with a hint of dissolution into unrelated  particles.    
When a man and woman arrive at that stage of reasoning and feeling, it  were idle for their chronicler to moralize; her part is but to tell the  story.
