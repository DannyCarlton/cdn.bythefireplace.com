    Philip played with excellent effect, and his efforts were received   with as much favor at Knoxville as at Wilkesville. He was twice   encored, and at the end of each of his selections he was greeted  with  applause. 
  As for Professor Riccabocca, people hardly knew what to make of  him.  He was as eccentric and extravagant as ever, and his recitations   were received with good-natured amusement. He didn't lack for   applause, however. There were some boys on the front seats who   applauded him, just for the fun of it. Though the applause was   ironical, the professor persuaded himself that it was genuine, and   posed before the audience at each outburst, with his hand on his   heart, and his head bent so far over that he seemed likely to lose   his balance. 
  &quot;We are making a grand success, Mr. Gray,&quot; he said, during the   interval of ten minutes already referred to. &quot;Did you notice how  they  applauded me?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Philip, with a smile. 
  &quot;They evidently appreciate true genius. It reminds me of the  ovation  they gave me at Cincinnati last winter.&quot; 
  &quot;Does it?&quot; asked Philip, still smiling. 
  &quot;Yes. I was a great favorite in that intellectual city. By the way,   I noticed that they seemed well pleased with your playing also.&quot; 
  This he said carelessly, as if Philip's applause was not to be   compared to his. 
  &quot;Yes, they treat me very kindly,&quot; answered Philip. 
  &quot;You are fortunate in having me to introduce you to the public,&quot;   said the professor emphatically. &quot;The name of Riccabocca is so well   known, that it is of great advantage to you.&quot; 
  The professor deluded himself with the idea that he was a great   elocutionist, and that the public rated him as highly as he did   himself. When anything occurred that did not seem to favor this  view,  he closed his eyes to it, preferring to believe that he was a  popular  favorite. 
  &quot;I hope I shall never be so deceived about myself,&quot; thought Philip. 
  When the entertainment was over, Mr. Caswell, president of the  club,  came up to Philip and said cordially: 
  &quot;Mr. Gray, we are very much indebted to you. Thanks to you, we are   out of debt, and shall have a balance of from twelve to fifteen   dollars in the treasury.&quot; 
  &quot;I am very glad of it,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;So am I,&quot; said the professor, pushing forward, jealous lest Philip   should get more than his share of credit. 
  &quot;And we are indebted to you also, Professor Riccabocca,&quot; said the   president, taking the hint. 
  &quot;You are entirely welcome, sir,&quot; said Riccabocca loftily. &quot;My help   has often been asked in behalf of charitable organizations. I   remember once, in Philadelphia, I alone raised five hundred dollars   for a&#8212;a&#8212;I think it was a hospital.&quot; 
  This was an invention, but Professor Riccabocca had no scruple in   getting up little fictions which he thought likely to redound to his   credit and increase his reputation. 
  &quot;Doubtless you are often called upon also, Mr. Gray,&quot; suggested Mr.   Caswell with a smile. 
  &quot;No,&quot; answered Philip. &quot;This is the first time that I have ever had   the opportunity.&quot; 
  &quot;There's no humbug about the boy,&quot; thought Mr. Caswell. &quot;As for the   professor, he is full of it.&quot; 
  &quot;I have pleasure in handing you the price agreed upon,&quot; said the   president, presenting each with a ten-dollar bill. 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Philip. 
  Professor Riccabocca carelessly tucked the bill into his vest   pocket, as if it were a mere trifle. 
  At this moment, Mr. Turner came up with all the other gentleman.   &quot;Mr. Gray,&quot; he said, &quot;here is a gentleman who wishes to speak to   you.&quot; 
  Philip looked up, and saw the well-known figure of Squire Pope.
