The night before he sailed he rode out to the Grange estate. The wall of  the cemetery had been repaired, James Lytton's slab was in its place,  the tree had been removed, and he had rebuilt the mound above his  mother as soon as the earth was firm again. There was no evidence of the  hurricane here. The moon was out, and in her mellow bath the Island had  the beauty of a desert. Alexander leaned his elbows on the wall and  stared down at his mother's grave. He knew that he never should see it  again. What he was about to do was for good and all. He would no more  waste months returning to this remote Island than he would turn back  from any of the goals of his future. And it mattered nothing to the dead  woman there. If she had an immortal part, it would follow him, and she  had suffered too much in life for her dust to resent neglect. But he  passionately wished that she were alive and that she were sailing with  him to his new world. He had ceased to repine her loss, much to miss  her, but his sentiment for her was still the strongest in his life, and  as a companion he had found no one to take her place. To-night he wanted  to talk to her. He was bursting with hope and anticipation and the  enthusiasm of the mere change, but he was close to melancholy.    
Suddenly he bent his head. From the earth arose the golden music of a  million tiny bells. They had hung rusty and warped since the hurricane,  but to-night they rang again, and as sweetly as on the night, seventeen  years ago, when their music filled the Universe, and two souls, whose  destiny it was to bring a greater into the world, were flooded with a  diviner music than that fairy melody. Alexander knew nothing of that  meeting of his parents, when they were but a few years older than he was  to-night, but the inherited echo of those hours when his own soul  awaited its sentence may have stirred in his brain, for he stood there  and dreamed of his mother and father as they had looked and thought when  they had met and loved; and this he had never done before. The tireless  little ringers filled his brain with their Lilliputian clamour, and his  imagination gave him his parents in the splendour of their young beauty  and passion. For the first time he forgave his father, and he had a deep  moment of insight: one of the mysteries of life was bare before him. He  was to have many of these cosmic moments, for although his practical  brain relied always on hard work, never on inspiration, his divining  faculty performed some marvellous feats, and saved him from much  plodding; but he never had a moment of insight which left a profounder  impression than this. He understood in a flash the weakness of the  world, and his own. At first he was appalled, then he pitied, then he  vibrated to the thrill of that exultation which had possessed his mother  the night on the mountain when she made up her mind to outstay her  guests. And then the future seemed to beckon more imperiously to the boy  for whose sake she had remained, the radiant image of his parents melted  in its crucible, and the world was flooded with a light which revealed  more than the smoke of battlefields and the laurels of fulfilled  ambition.
