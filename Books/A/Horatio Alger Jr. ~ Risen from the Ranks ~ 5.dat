  &#8220;Allow me to introduce myself,&#8221; said the stranger boy. &#8220;My name is  Oscar Vincent, from Boston, at present a student at the Prescott  Academy, at your service.&#8221;
  As he spoke, he doffed his hat and bowed, showing a profusion of  chestnut hair, a broad, open brow, and an attractive face, lighted up  by a pleasant smile.
  Harry felt drawn to him by a feeling which was not long in ripening  into friendship.
  Imitating the other's frankness, he also took off his hat and  replied,&#8212;
  &#8220;Let me introduce myself, in turn, as Harry Walton, junior  apprentice in the office of the 'Centreville Gazette,' sometimes  profanely called 'printer's devil.'&#8220;
  &#8220;Good!&#8221; said Oscar, laughing. &#8220;How do you like the business?&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I shall like it, but I have only just started in it. I went  into the office for the first time to-day.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have an uncle who started as you are doing,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;He is  now chief editor of a daily paper in Boston.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is he?&#8221; said Harry, with interest. &#8220;Did he find it hard to rise?&#8221;
  &#8220;He is a hard worker. I have heard him say that he used to sit up  late of nights during his apprenticeship, studying and improving  himself.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is what I mean to do,&#8221; said Harry.
  &#8220;I don't think he was as lazy as his nephew,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;I am  afraid if I had been in his place I should have remained in it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you lazy?&#8221; asked Harry, smiling at the other's frankness.
  &#8220;A little so; that is, I don't improve my opportunities as I might.  Father wants to make a lawyer of me so he has put me here, and I am  preparing for Harvard.&#8221;
  &#8220;I envy you,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;There is nothing I should like so much as  entering college.&#8221;
  &#8220;I daresay I shall like it tolerably well,&#8221; said Oscar; &#8220;but I don't<I>  hanker</I> after it, as the boy said after swallowing a dose of castor  oil. I'll tell you what I should like better&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;What?&#8221; asked Harry, as the other paused.
  &#8220;I should like to enter the Naval Academy, and qualify myself for  the naval service. I always liked the sea.&#8221;
  &#8220;Doesn't your father approve of your doing this?&#8221;
  &#8220;He wouldn't mind my entering the navy as an officer, but he is not  willing to have me enter the merchant service.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then why doesn't he send you to the Naval Academy?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because I can't enter without receiving the appointment from a  member of Congress. Our member can only appoint one, and there is no  vacancy. So, as I can't go where I want to, I am preparing for  Harvard.&#8221;
  &#8220;Are you studying Latin and Greek?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you studied them long?&#8221;
  &#8220;About two years. I was looking over my Greek lesson when you  playfully tumbled over me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will you let me look at your book? I never saw a Greek book.&#8221;
  &#8220;I sometimes wish I never had,&#8221; said Oscar; &#8220;but that's when I am  lazy.&#8221;
  Harry opened the book&#8212;a Greek reader&#8212;in the middle of an extract  from Xenophon, and looked with some awe at the unintelligible letters.
  &#8220;Can you read it? Can you understand what it means?&#8221; he asked,  looking up from the book.
  &#8220;So-so.&#8221;
  &#8220;You must know a great deal.&#8221;
  Oscar laughed.
  &#8220;I wonder what Dr. Burton would say if he heard you,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Who is he?&#8221;
  &#8220;Principal of our Academy. He gave me a blowing up for my ignorance  to-day, because I missed an irregular Greek verb. I'm not exactly a  dunce, but I don't think I shall ever be a Greek professor.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you speak of yourself that way, what will you think of me? I  don't know a word of Latin, of Greek, or any language except my own.&#8221;
  &#8220;Because you have had no chance to learn. There's one language I  know more about than Latin or Greek.&#8221;
  &#8220;English?&#8221;
  &#8220;I mean French; I spent a year at a French boarding-school, three  years since.&#8221;
  &#8220;What! Have you been in France?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes; an uncle of mine&#8212;in fact, the editor&#8212;was going over, and  urged father to send me. I learned considerable French, but not much  else. I can speak and understand it pretty well.&#8221;
  &#8220;How I wish I had had your advantages,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;How did you  like your French schoolmates?&#8221;
  &#8220;They wouldn't come near me at first. Because I was an American they  thought I carried a revolver and a dirk-knife, and was dangerous. That  is their idea of American boys. When they found I was tame, and carried  no deadly weapons, they ventured to speak with me, and after that we  got along pretty well.&#8221;
  &#8220;How soon do you expect to go to college?&#8221;
  &#8220;A year from next summer. I suppose I shall be ready by that time.  You are going to stay in town, I suppose?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, if I keep my place.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, you'll do that. Then we can see something of each other. You  must come up to my room, and see me. Come almost any evening.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should like to. Do you live in Dr. Barton's family?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I hope not.&#8221;
  &#8220;Why not?&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, the Doctor has a way of looking after the fellows that room in  the house, and of keeping them at work all the time. That wouldn't suit  me. I board at Mrs. Greyson's, at the south-east corner of the church  common. Have you got anything to do this evening?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing in particular.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then come round and take a look at my den, or sanctum I ought to  call it; as I am talking to a member of the editorial profession.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not quite yet,&#8221; said Harry, smiling.
  &#8220;Oh, well that'll come in due time. Will you come?&#8221;
  &#8220;Sha'n't I be disturbing you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not a bit. My Greek lesson is about finished, and that's all I've  got to do this evening. Come round, and we will sit over the fire, and  chat like old friends.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, Oscar,&#8221; said Harry, irresistibly attracted by his bright  and lively acquaintance, &#8220;I shall enjoy calling. I have made no  acquaintances yet, and I feel lonely.&#8221;
  &#8220;I have got over that,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;I am used to being away from  home and don't mind it.&#8221;
  The two boys walked together to Oscar's boarding-place. It was a  large house, of considerable pretension for a village, and Oscar's room  was large and handsomely furnished. But what attracted Harry's  attention was not the furniture, but a collection of over a hundred  books, ranged on shelves at one end of the room. In his father's house  it had always been so difficult to obtain the necessaries of life that  books had necessarily been regarded as superfluities, and beyond a  dozen volumes which Harry had read and re-read, he was compelled to  depend on such as he could borrow. Here again his privileges were  scanty, for most of the neighbors were as poorly supplied as his  father.
  &#8220;What a fine library you have, Oscar!&#8221; he exclaimed.
  &#8220;I have a few books,&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;My father filled a couple of  boxes, and sent me. He has a large library.&#8221;
  &#8220;This seems a large library to me,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;My father likes  reading, but he is poor, and cannot afford to buy books.&#8221;
  He said that in a matter-of-fact tone, without the least attempt to  conceal what many boys would have been tempted to hide. Oscar noted  this, and liked his new friend the better for it.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said, &#8220;books cost money, and one hasn't always the money  to spare.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you read all these books?&#8221;
  &#8220;Not more than half of them. I like reading better than studying, I  am afraid. I am reading the Waverley novels now. Have you read any of  them?&#8221;
  &#8220;So; I never saw any of them before.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you see anything you would like to read, I will lend it to you  with pleasure,&#8221; said Oscar, noticing the interest with which Harry  regarded the books.
  &#8220;Will you?&#8221; said Harry, eagerly. &#8220;I can't tell you how much obliged  I am. I will take good care of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, I am sure of that. Here, try Ivanhoe. I've just read it, and  it's tip-top.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you; I will take it on your recommendation. What a nice room  you have!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, it's pretty comfortable. Father told me to fix it up to suit  me. He said he wouldn't mind the expense if I would only study.&#8221;
  &#8220;I should think anybody might study in such a room as this, and with  such a fine collection of books.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm rather lazy sometimes,&#8221; said Oscar, &#8220;but I shall turn over a  new leaf some of these days, and astonish everybody. To-night, as I  have no studying to do, I'll tell you what we'll do. Did you ever pop  corn?&#8221;
  &#8220;Sometimes.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've got some corn here, and Ma'am Greyson has a popper. Stay here  alone a minute, and I'll run down and get it.&#8221;
  Oscar ran down stairs, and speedily returned with a corn-popper.
  &#8220;Now we'll have a jolly time,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Draw up that arm-chair, and  make yourself at home. If Xenophon, or Virgil, or any of those Greek  and Latin chaps call, we'll tell 'em we are transacting important  business and can't be disturbed. What do you say?&#8221;
  &#8220;They won't be apt to call on me,&#8221; said Harry. I haven't the  pleasure of knowing them.&#8221;
  &#8220;It isn't always a pleasure, I can assure you, Harry. Pass over the  corn-popper.&#8221;
