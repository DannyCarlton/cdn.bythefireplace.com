  Carrigan's first impulse, sudden as the thrill that leaped through   him, was to cry out to the occupants of the unseen canoe. Words  were  on his lips, but he forced them back. They could not miss  him, could  not get beyond the reach of his voice&#8212;and he waited.  After all, there  might be profit in a reasonable degree of  caution. He crept back  toward his rifle, sensing the fact that  movement no longer gave him  very great distress. At the same time  he lost no sound from the river.  The voices were silent, and the  dip, dip, dip of paddles was  approaching softly and with extreme  caution. At last he could barely  hear the trickle of them, yet he  knew the canoe was coming steadily  nearer. There was a suspicious  secretiveness in its approach. Perhaps  the lady with the beautiful  eyes and the glistening hair had changed  her mind again and was  returning to put an end to him. 
  The thought sharpened his vision. He saw a thin shadow a little   darker than the gloom of the river; it grew into shape; something   grated lightly upon sand and pebbles, and then he heard the  guarded  plash of feet in shallow water and saw some one pulling  the canoe up  higher. A second figure joined the first. They  advanced a few paces  and stopped. In a moment a voice called  softly, 
  &quot;M'sieu! M'sieu Carrigan!&quot; 
  There was an anxious note in the voice, but Carrigan held his   tongue. And then he heard the woman say, 
  &quot;It was here, Bateese! I am sure of it!&quot; 
  There was more than anxiety in her voice now. Her words trembled   with distress. &quot;Bateese&#8212;if he is dead&#8212;he is up there close to  the  trees.&quot; 
  &quot;But he isn't dead,&quot; said Carrigan, raising himself a little. &quot;He   is here, behind the rock again!&quot; 
  In a moment she had run to where he was lying, his hand clutching   the cold barrel of the pistol which he had found in the sand, his   white face looking up at her. Again he found himself staring into  the  glow of her eyes, and in that pale light which precedes the  coming of  stars and moon the fancy struck him that she was  lovelier than in the  full radiance of the sun. He heard a  throbbing note in her throat. And  then she was down on her knees  at his side, leaning close over him,  her hands groping at his  shoulders, her quick breath betraying how  swiftly her heart was  beating. 
  &quot;You are not hurt&#8212;badly?&quot; she cried. 
  &quot;I don't know,&quot; replied David. &quot;You made a perfect shot. I think a   part of my head is gone. At least you've shot away my balance,   because I can't stand on my feet!&quot; 
  Her hand touched his face, remaining there for an instant, and the   palm of it pressed his forehead. It was like the touch of cool   velvet, he thought. Then she called to the man named Bateese. He  made  Carrigan think of a huge chimpanzee as he came near, because  of the  shortness of his body and the length of his arms. In the  half light he  might have been a huge animal, a hulking creature of  some sort walking  upright. Carrigan's fingers closed more tightly  on the butt of his  automatic. The woman began to talk swiftly in a  patois of French and  Cree. David caught the gist of it. She was  telling Bateese to carry  him to the canoe, and to be very careful,  because m'sieu was badly  hurt. It was his head, she emphasized.  Bateese must be careful of his  head. 
  David slipped his pistol into its holster as Bateese bent over   him. He tried to smile at the woman to thank her for her   solicitude&#8212;after having nearly killed him. There was an  increasing  glow in the night, and he began to see her more  plainly. Out on the  middle of the river was a silvery bar of  light. The moon was coming  up, a little pale as yet, but  triumphant in the fact that clouds had  blotted out the sun an hour  before his time. Between this bar of light  and himself he saw the  head of Bateese. It was a wild, savage-looking  head, bound pirate-  fashion round the forehead with a huge Hudson's  Bay kerchief.  Bateese might have been old Jack Ketch himself bending  over to  give the final twist to a victim's neck. His long arms slipped   under David. Gently and without effort he raised him to his feet.  And  then, as easily as he might have lifted a child, he trundled  him up in  his arms and walked off with him over the sand. 
  Carrigan had not expected this. He was a little shocked and felt   also the impropriety of the thing. The idea of being lugged off  like  a baby was embarrassing, even in the presence of the one who  had  deliberately put him in his present condition. Bateese did the  thing  with such beastly ease. It was as if he was no more than a  small boy,  a runt with no weight whatever, and Bateese was a man.  He would have  preferred to stagger along on his own feet or creep  on his hands and  knees, and he grunted as much to Bateese on the  way to the canoe. He  felt, at the same time, that the situation  owed him something more of  discussion and explanation. Even now,  after half killing him, the  woman was taking a rather high-handed  advantage of him. She might at  least have assured him that she had  made a mistake and was sorry. But  she did not speak to him again.  She said nothing more to Bateese, and  when the half-breed  deposited him in the midship part of the canoe,  facing the bow,  she stood back in silence. Then Bateese brought his  pack and  rifle, and wedged the pack in behind him so that he could sit   upright. After that, without pausing to ask permission, he picked  up  the woman and carried her through the shallow water to the bow,  saving  her the wetting of her feet. 
  As she turned to find her paddle her face was toward David, and   for a moment she was looking at him. 
  &quot;Do you mind telling me who you are, and where we are going?&quot; he   asked. 
  &quot;I am Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain,&quot; she said. &quot;My brigade is down   the river, M'sieu Carrigan.&quot; 
  He was amazed at the promptness of her confession, for as one of   the working factors of the long arm of the police he accepted it  as  that. He had scarcely expected her to divulge her name after  the  cold-blooded way in which she had attempted to kill him. And  she had  spoken quite calmly of &quot;my brigade.&quot; He had heard of the  Boulain  Brigade. It was a name associated with Chipewyan, as he  remembered  it&#8212;or Fort McMurray. He was not sure just where the  Boulain scows had  traded freight with the upper-river craft. Until  this year he was  positive they had not come as far south as  Athabasca Landing.  Boulain&#8212;Boulain&#8212;The name repeated itself over  and over in his mind.  Bateese shoved off the canoe, and the  woman's paddle dipped in and out  of the water beginning to shimmer  in moonlight. But he could not, for  a time, get himself beyond the  pounding of that name in his brain. It  was not merely that he had  heard the name before. There was something  significant about it.  Something that made him grope back in his memory  of things.  Boulain! He whispered it to himself, his eyes on the  slender  figure of the woman ahead of him, swaying gently to the steady   sweep of the paddle in her hands. Yet he could think of nothing. A   feeling of irritation swept over him, disgust at his own mental   impotency. And the dizzying sickness was brewing in his head  again. 
  &quot;I have heard that name&#8212;somewhere&#8212;before,&quot; he said. There was a   space of only five or six feet between them, and he spoke with   studied distinctness. 
  &quot;Possibly you have, m'sieu.&quot; 
  Her voice was exquisite, clear as the note of a bird, yet so soft   and low that she seemed scarcely to have spoken. And it was,  Carrigan  thought, criminally evasive&#8212;under the circumstances. He  wanted her to  turn round and say something. He wanted, first of  all, to ask her why  she had tried to kill him. It was his right to  demand an explanation.  And it was his duty to get her back to the  Landing, where the law  would ask an accounting of her. She must  know that. There was only one  way in which she could have learned  his name, and that was by prying  into his identification papers  while he was unconscious. Therefore she  not only knew his name,  but also that he was Sergeant Carrigan of the  Royal Northwest  Mounted Police. In spite of all this she was  apparently not very  deeply concerned. She was not frightened, and she  did not appear  to be even slightly excited. 
  He leaned nearer to her, the movement sending a sharp pain between   his eyes. It almost drew a cry from him, but he forced himself to   speak without betraying it. 
  &quot;You tried to murder me&#8212;and almost succeeded. Haven't you   anything to say?&quot; 
  &quot;Not now, m'sieu&#8212;except that it was a mistake. and I am sorry.   But you must not talk. You must remain quiet. I am afraid your  skull  is fractured.&quot; 
  Afraid his skull was fractured! And she expressed her fear in the   casual way she might have spoken of a toothache. He leaned back   against his dunnage sack and closed his eyes. Probably she was  right.  These fits of dizziness and nausea were suspicious. They  made him  top-heavy and filled him with a desire to crumple up  somewhere. He was  clear-mindedly conscious of this and of his  fight against the  weakness. But in those moments when he felt  better and his head was  clear of pain, he had not seriously  thought of a fractured skull. If  she believed it, why did she not  treat him a bit more considerately?  Bateese, with that strength of  an ox in his arms, had no use for her  assistance with the paddle.  She might at least have sat facing him,  even if she refused to  explain matters more definitely. 
  A mistake, she called it. And she was sorry for him! She had made   those statements in a matter-of-fact way, but with a voice that  was  like music. She had spoken perfect English, but in her words  were the  inflection and velvety softness of the French blood which  must be  running red in her veins. And her name was Jeanne Marie-  Anne Boulain! 
  With eyes closed, Carrigan called himself an idiot for thinking of   these things at the present time. Primarily he was a man-hunter  out  on important duty, and here was duty right at hand, a thousand  miles  south of Black Roger Audemard, the wholesale murderer he was  after. He  would have sworn on his life that Black Roger had never  gone at a  killing more deliberately than this same Jeanne Marie-  Anne Boulain  had gone after him behind the rock! 
  Now that it was all over, and he was alive, she was taking him   somewhere as coolly and as unexcitedly as though they were  returning  from a picnic. Carrigan shut his eyes tighter and  wondered if he was  thinking straight. He believed he was badly  hurt, but he was as  strongly convinced that his mind was clear.  And he lay quietly with  his head against the pack, his eyes  closed, waiting for the coolness  of the river to drive his nausea  away again. 
  He sensed rather than felt the swift movement of the canoe. There   was no perceptible tremor to its progress. The current and a  perfect  craftsmanship with the paddles were carrying it along at  six or seven  miles an hour. He heard the rippling of water that at  times was almost  like the tinkling of tiny bells, and more and  more bell-like became  that sound as he listened to it. It struck a  certain note for him. And  to that note another added itself, until  in the purling rhythm of the  river he caught the murmuring  monotone of a name  Boulain&#8212;Boulain&#8212;Boulain. The name became an  obsession. It meant  something. And he knew what it meant&#8212;if he  could only whip his memory  back into harness again. But that was  impossible now. When he tried to  concentrate his mental faculties,  his head ached terrifically. 
  He dipped his hand into the water and held it over his eyes. For   half an hour after that he did not raise his head. In that time  not a  word was spoken by Bateese or Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain. For  the  forest people it was not an hour in which to talk. The moon  had risen  swiftly, and the stars were out. Where there had been  gloom, the world  was now a flood of gold and silver light. At  first Carrigan allowed  this to filter between his fingers; then he  opened his eyes. He felt  more evenly balanced again. 
  Straight in front of him was Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain. The   curtain of dusk had risen from between them, and she was full in  the  radiance of the moon. She was no longer paddling, but was  looking  straight ahead. To Cardigan her figure was exquisitely  girlish as he  saw it now. She was bareheaded, as he had seen tier  first, and her  hair hung down her back like a shimmering mass of  velvety sable in the  star-and-moon glow. Something told Carrigan  she was going to turn her  face in his direction, and he dropped  his hand over his eyes again,  leaving a space between the fingers.  He was right in his guess. She  fronted the moon, looking at him  closely&#8212;rather anxiously, he  thought. She even leaned a little  toward him that she might see more  clearly. Then she turned and  resumed her paddling. 
  Carrigan was a bit elated. Probably she had looked at him a number   of times like that during the past half-hour. And she was  disturbed.  She was worrying about him. The thought of being a  murderess was  beginning to frighten her. In spite of the beauty of  her eyes and hair  and the slim witchery of her body he had no  sympathy for her. He told  himself that he would give a year of his  life to have her down at  Barracks this minute. He would never  forget that three-quarters of an  hour behind the rock, not if he  lived to be a hundred. And if he did  live, she was going to pay,  even if she was lovelier than Venus and  all the Graces combined.  He felt irritated with himself that he should  have observed in  such a silly way the sable glow of her hair in the  moonlight. And  her eyes. What the deuce did prettiness matter in the  present  situation? The sister of Fanchet, the mail robber, was  beautiful,  but her beauty had failed to save Fanchet. The Law had  taken him  in spite of the tears in Carmin Fanchet's big black eyes,  and in  that particular instance he was the Law. And Carmin Fanchet was   pretty&#8212;deucedly pretty. Even the Old Man's heart had been stirred  by  her loveliness. 
  &quot;A shame!&quot; he had said to Carrigan. &quot;A shame!&quot; But the rascally   Fanchet was hung by the neck until he was dead. 
  Carrigan drew himself up slowly until he was sitting erect. He   wondered what Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain would say if he told her   about Carmin. But there was a big gulf between the names Fanchet  and  Boulain. The Fanchets had come from the dance halls of Alaska.  They  were bad, both of them. At least, so they had judged Carmin   Fanchet&#8212;along with her brother. And Boulain&#8212; 
  His hand, in dropping to his side, fell upon the butt of his   pistol. Neither Bateese nor the girl had thought of disarming him.  It  was careless of them, unless Bateese was keeping a good eye on  him  from behind. 
  A new sort of thrill crept into Carrigan's blood. He began to see   where he had made a huge error in not playing his part more  cleverly.  It was this girl Jeanne who had shot him. It was Jeanne  who had stood  over him in that last moment when he had made an  effort to use his  pistol. It was she who had tried to murder him  and who had turned  faint-hearted when it came to finishing the  job. But his knowledge of  these things he should have kept from  her. Then, when the proper  moment came, he would have been in a  position to act. Even now it  might be possible to cover his  blunder. He leaned toward her again,  determined to make the  effort. 
  &quot;I want to ask your pardon,&quot; he said. &quot;May I?&quot; 
  His voice startled her. It was as if the stinging tip of a whip-   lash had touched her bare neck. He was smiling when she turned. In   her face and eyes was a relief which she made no effort to  repress. 
  &quot;You thought I might be dead,&quot; he laughed softly. &quot;I'm not, Miss   Jeanne. I'm very much alive again. It was that accursed fever&#8212;and  I  want to ask your pardon! I think&#8212;I know&#8212;that I accused you of   shooting me. It's impossible. I couldn't think of it&#8212;In my clear   mind. I am quite sure that I know the rascally half-breed who pot-   shotted me like that. And it was you who came in time, and  frightened  him away, and saved my life. Will you forgive me&#8212;and  accept my  gratitude?&quot; 
  There came into the glowing eyes of the girl a reflection of his   own smile. It seemed to him that he saw the corners of her mouth   tremble a little before she answered him. 
  &quot;I am glad you are feeling better, m'sieu.&quot; 
  &quot;And you will forgive me for&#8212;for saying such beastly things to   you?&quot; 
  She was lovely when she smiled, and she was smiling at him now.   &quot;If you want to be forgiven for lying, yes,&quot; she said. &quot;I forgive  you  that, because it is sometimes your business to lie. It was I  who tried  to kill you, m'sieu. And you know it.&quot; 
  &quot;But&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You must not talk, m'sieu. It is not good for you: Bateese, will   you tell m'sieu not to talk?&quot; 
  Carrigan heard a movement behind him. 
  &quot;M'sieu, you will stop ze talk or I brak hees head wit' ze paddle   in my han'!&quot; came the voice of Bateese close to his shoulder. &quot;Do  I  mak' ze word plain so m'sieu compren'?&quot; 
  &quot;I get you, old man,&quot; grunted Carrigan. &quot;I get you&#8212;both!&quot; 
  And he leaned back against his dunnage-sack, staring again at the   witching slimness of the lovely Jeanne Marie-Anne Boulain as she   calmly resumed her paddling in the bow of the canoe.
