    The next morning at breakfast, Professor Riccabocca handed Philip a   copy of the Wilkesville Daily Bulletin. Pointing to a paragraph on   the editorial page, he said, in a tone of pride and satisfaction: 
  &quot;Read that, Mr. de Gray.&quot; 
  It ran thus: 
  &quot;We congratulate the citizens of Wilkesville on the remarkable   entertainment which they will have an opportunity of enjoying this   evening at the Music Hall. Professor Lorenzo Riccabocca, whose fame   as an elocutionist and dramatic reader has made his name a household   word throughout Europe and America, will give some of his choice   recitals and personations, assisted by Philip de Gray, the wonderful   boy-musician, whose talent as a violin-player has been greeted with   rapturous applause in all parts of the United States. It is   universally acknowledged that no one of his age has ever equaled  him.  He, as well as Professor Riccabocca, will give but a limited  series of  entertainments in this country, having received flattering  inducements  to cross the Atlantic, and appear professionally in  London, Paris, and  the chief cities of the Continent. Fifty cents is  the pitiful sum for  which our citizens will have it put in their  power to hear this  wonderful combination of talent. This secures a  reserved seat.&quot; 
  Philip read this notice with increasing amazement. 
  &quot;What do you think of that, Mr. de Gray?&quot; asked the professor   gleefully. &quot;Won't that make Wilkesville open its eyes, eh?&quot; 
  &quot;It has made me open my eyes, professor,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;Ha, ha!&quot; said the professor, appearing amused. 
  &quot;How soon are we to sail for Europe?&quot; asked Philip, smiling. 
  &quot;When Queen Victoria sends our passage-money,&quot; answered Riccabocca,   laughing. 
  &quot;I see that your name is a household word in Europe. Were you ever   there?&quot; 
  &quot;Never.&quot; 
  &quot;Then how can that be?&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. de Gray, your performances have been greeted with applause in   all parts of the United States. How do you explain that?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't pretend to explain it. I wasn't aware that my name had  ever  been heard of a hundred miles from here.&quot; 
  &quot;It has not, but it will be. I have only been predicting a little.   The paragraph isn't true now, but it will be some time, if we live   and prosper.&quot; 
  &quot;But I don't like to be looked upon as a humbug, professor,&quot; said   Philip uneasily. 
  &quot;You won't be. You are really a fine player, or I wouldn't consent   to appear with you. The name of Riccabocca, Mr. de Gray, I may   truthfully say, is well known. I have appeared in the leading cities   of America. They were particularly enthusiastic in Chicago,&quot; he  added  pensively. &quot;I wish I could find a paragraph from one of their  leading  papers, comparing my rendering of the soliloquy in 'Hamlet'  to Edwin  Booth's, rather to the disadvantage of that tragedian.&quot; 
  &quot;I would like to read the notice,&quot; said Philip, who had very strong   doubts as to whether such a paragraph had ever appeared in print. 
  &quot;You shall see it. It will turn up somewhere. I laid it aside   carefully, for I confess, Mr. de Gray, it gratified me much. I have   only one thing to regret: I should myself have gone on the stage,  and  essayed leading tragic roles. It may not be too late now. What  do you  think?&quot; 
  &quot;I can tell better after I have heard you, professor,&quot; answered   Philip. 
  &quot;True, you can. Mr. de Gray,&quot; continued the professor, lowering his   voice, &quot;notice how much attention we are receiving from the guests  at  the tables. They have doubtless read the notice of our evening   entertainment.&quot; 
  Philip looked round the room, which was of good size, and contained   some thirty or more guests, and he saw that the professor was right. 
  He met several curious glances, some fair ladies expressing  interest  as well as curiosity, and his face flushed. 
  &quot;Gratifying, isn't it?&quot; said the professor, smiling. 
  &quot;No, I don't think it is,&quot; answered our hero. 
  &quot;Why not?&quot; demanded Professor Riccabocca, appearing amazed. 
  &quot;If all were true, it might be,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;As it is, I feel   like a humbug.&quot; 
  &quot;Humbug pays in this world,&quot; said the professor cheerfully. &quot;By the   way, there's another little paragraph to which I will call your   attention.&quot; 
  Philip read this additional item: 
  &quot;We understand that Professor Riecabocca and Mr. Philip de Gray  have  received a cable despatch from the Prince of Wales, inviting them  to  instruct his sons in elocution and music, at a very liberal salary.   They have this proposal under consideration, though they are   naturally rather reluctant to give up the plaudits of the public,   even for so honorable a position.&quot; 
  &quot;Professor Riccabocca,&quot; said Philip, considerably annoyed by this   audacious invention, &quot;you ought to have consulted me before   publishing such a falsehood as this.&quot; 
  &quot;Falsehood, Mr. de Gray? Really I'm shocked! Gentlemen don't use   such words, or make such charges.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't mean to say it's true that we have received any such   telegram?&quot; 
  &quot;No; of course not.&quot; 
  &quot;Then why didn't I use the right word?&quot; 
  &quot;It's an innocent little fiction, my young friend&#8212;a fiction that   will do no one any harm, but will cause us to be regarded with   extraordinary interest.&quot; 
  Here the thought occurred to Philip that he, the future instructor   of British royalty, had only just escaped from a poorhouse, and it   seemed to him so droll that he burst out laughing. 
  &quot;Why do you laugh, Mr. de Gray?&quot; asked the professor, a little   suspiciously. 
  &quot;I was thinking of something amusing,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;Well, well! We shall have cause to laugh when we play this evening   to a crowded house.&quot; 
  &quot;I hope so. But, professor, if we keep together, you mustn't print   any more such paragraphs about me. Of course, I am not responsible   for what you say about yourself.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, it will be all right!&quot; said Riccabocca. &quot;What are you going to   do with yourself?&quot; 
  &quot;I shall practice a little in my room, for I want to play well   to-night. When I get tired I shall take a walk.&quot; 
  &quot;Very wise&#8212;very judicious. I don't need to do it, being, as I may   say, a veteran reader. I wouldn't rehearse if I were to play this   evening before the president and all the distinguished men of the   nation.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't feel so confident of myself,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;No, of course not. By the way, can you lend me fifty cents, Mr. de   Gray?&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't want to break a ten.&quot; 
  Professor Riccabocca didn't mention that the only ten he had was a   ten-cent piece. 
  Slipping Philip's half-dollar into his vest pocket, he said   carelessly: 
  &quot;We'll take this into the account when we divide the proceeds of  the  entertainment.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well,&quot; said Philip. 
  He went up to his room and played for an hour or more, rehearsing   the different pieces he had selected for the evening, and then,   feeling the need of a little fresh air, he took a walk. 
  In different parts of the town he saw posters, on which his name  was  printed in large letters. 
  &quot;It seems almost like a joke!&quot; he said to himself. 
  Just then he heard his name called, and, looking up, he recognized  a  young fellow, of sixteen or thereabouts, who had formerly lived in   Norton. It seemed pleasant to see a familiar face. 
  &quot;Why, Morris Lovett,&quot; he exclaimed &quot;I didn't know you were here!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I'm clerk in a store. Are you the one that is going to give  an  entertainment tonight?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Philip, smiling. 
  &quot;I didn't know you were such a great player,&quot; said Morris,  regarding  our hero with new respect. 
  He had read the morning paper. 
  &quot;Nor I,&quot; said Philip, laughing. 
  &quot;Are you going to Europe soon?&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't decided yet!&quot; Philip answered, laughing. 
  &quot;I wish I had your chance.&quot; 
  &quot;Come and hear me this evening, at any rate,&quot; said Philip. &quot;Call at   the hotel, at six o'clock, and I'll give you a ticket.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll be sure to come,&quot; said Morris, well pleased.
