"God of my soul! Do not speak of hope to me. Hope? For what are those  three frigates, swarming with a horde of foreign bandits, creeping about  our bay? For what have the persons of General Vallejo and Judge Leese  been seized and imprisoned? Why does a strip of cotton, painted with a  gaping bear, flaunt itself above Sonoma? Oh, abomination! Oh, execrable  profanation! Mother of God, open thine ocean and suck them down! Smite  them with pestilence if they put foot in our capital! Shrivel their  fingers to the bone if they dethrone our Aztec Eagle and flourish their  stars and stripes above our fort! O California! That thy sons and thy  daughters should live to see thee plucked like a rose by the usurper!  And why? Why? Not because these piratical Americans have the right to  one league of our land; but because, Holy Evangelists! they want it! Our  lands are rich, our harbours are fine, gold veins our valleys, therefore  we must be plucked. The United States of America are mightier than  Mexico, therefore they sweep down upon us with mouths wide open. Holy  God! That I could choke but one with my own strong fingers. Oh!" Dona  Eustaquia paused abruptly and smote her hands together,--"O that I were  a man! That the women of California were men!"    
On this pregnant morning of July seventh, eighteen hundred and  forty-six, all aristocratic Monterey was gathered in the sala of Dona  Modeste Castro. The hostess smiled sadly. "That is the wish of my  husband," she said, "for the men of our country want the Americans."    
"And why?" asked one of the young men, flicking a particle of dust from  his silken riding jacket. "We shall then have freedom from the constant  war of opposing factions. If General Castro and Governor Pico are not  calling Juntas in which to denounce each other, a Carillo is pitting his  ambition against an Alvarado. The Gringos will rule us lightly and bring  us peace. They will not disturb our grants, and will give us rich prices  for our lands--"    
"Oh, fool!" interrupted Dona Eustaquia. "Thrice fool! A hundred years  from now, Fernando Altimira, and our names will be forgotten in  California. Fifty years from now and our walls will tumble upon us  whilst we cook our beans in the rags that charity--American charity--has  flung us! I tell you that the hour the American flag waves above the  fort of Monterey is the hour of the Californians' doom. We have lived in  Arcadia--ingrates that you are to complain--they will run over us like  ants and sting us to death!"    
"That is the prediction of my husband," said Dona Modeste. "Liberty,  Independence, Decency, Honour, how long will they be his watch-words?"    
"Not a day longer!" cried Dona Eustaquia, "for the men of California are  cowards."    
"Cowards! We? No man should say that to us!" The caballeros were on  their feet, their eyes flashing, as if they faced in uniform the navy of  the United States, rather than confronted, in lace ruffles and silken  smallclothes, an angry scornful woman.    
"Cowards!" continued Fernando Altimira. "Are not men flocking about  General Castro at San Juan Bautista, willing to die in a cause already  lost? If our towns were sacked or our women outraged would not the  weakest of us fight until we died in our blood? But what is coming is  for the best, Dona Eustaquia, despite your prophecy; and as we cannot  help it--we, a few thousand men against a great nation--we resign  ourselves because we are governed by reason instead of by passion. No  one reverences our General more than Fernando Altimira. No grander man  ever wore a uniform! But he is fighting in a hopeless cause, and the  fewer who uphold him the less blood will flow, the sooner the struggle  will finish."    
Dona Modeste covered her beautiful face and wept. Many of the women  sobbed in sympathy. Bright eyes, from beneath gay rebosas or delicate  mantillas, glanced approvingly at the speaker. Brown old men and women  stared gloomily at the floor. But the greater number followed every  motion of their master-spirit, Dona Eustaquia Ortega.    
She walked rapidly up and down the long room, too excited to sit down,  flinging the mantilla back as it brushed her hot cheek. She was a woman  not yet forty, and very handsome, although the peachness of youth had  left her face. Her features were small but sharply cut; the square  chin and firm mouth had the lines of courage and violent emotions, her  piercing intelligent eyes interpreted a terrible power of love and hate.  But if her face was so strong as to be almost unfeminine, it was frank  and kind.    
Dona Eustaquia might watch with joy her bay open and engulf the hated  Americans, but she would nurse back to life the undrowned bodies flung  upon the shore. If she had been born a queen she would have slain in  anger, but she would not have tortured. General Castro had flung his hat  at her feet many times, and told her that she was born to command. Even  the nervous irregularity of her step to-day could not affect the extreme  elegance of her carriage, and she carried her small head with the  imperious pride of a sovereign. She did not speak again for a moment,  but as she passed the group of young men at the end of the room her eyes  flashed from one languid face to another. She hated their rich breeches  and embroidered jackets buttoned with silver and gold, the lace  handkerchiefs knotted about their shapely throats. No man was a man who  did not wear a uniform.    
Don Fernando regarded her with a mischievous smile as she approached him  a second time.    
"I predict, also," he said, "I predict that our charming Dona Eustaquia  will yet wed an American--"    
"What!" she turned upon him with the fury of a lioness. "Hold thy  prating tongue! I marry an American? God! I would give every league of  my ranchos for a necklace made from the ears of twenty Americans. I  would throw my jewels to the pigs, if I could feel here upon my neck  the proof that twenty American heads looked ready to be fired from the  cannon on the hill!"    
Everybody in the room laughed, and the atmosphere felt lighter. Muslin  gowns began to flutter, and the seal of disquiet sat less heavily upon  careworn or beautiful faces. But before the respite was a moment old a  young man entered hastily from the street, and throwing his hat on the  floor burst into tears.    
"What is it?" The words came mechanically from every one in the room.    
The herald put his hand to his throat to control the swelling muscles.  "Two hours ago," he said, "Commander Sloat sent one Captain William  Mervine on shore to demand of our Commandante the surrender of the town.  Don Mariano walked the floor, wringing his hands, until a quarter of an  hour ago, when he sent word to the insolent servant of a pirate-republic  that he had no authority to deliver up the capital, and bade him go to  San Juan Bautista and confer with General Castro. Whereupon the American  thief ordered two hundred and fifty of his men to embark in boats--do  not you hear?"    
A mighty cheer shook the air amidst the thunder of cannon; then another,  and another.    
Every lip in the room was white.    
"What is that?" asked Dona Eustaquia. Her voice was hardly audible.    
"They have raised the American flag upon the Custom-house," said the  herald.    
For a moment no one moved; then as by one impulse, and without a word,  Dona Modeste Castro and her guests rose and ran through the streets to  the Custom-house on the edge of the town.    
In the bay were three frigates of twenty guns each. On the rocks, in the  street by the Custom-house and on its corridors, was a small army of men  in the naval uniform of the United States, respectful but determined.  About them and the little man who read aloud from a long roll of paper,  the aristocrats joined the rabble of the town. Men with sunken eyes who  had gambled all night, leaving even serape and sombrero on the gaming  table; girls with painted faces staring above cheap and gaudy satins,  who had danced at fandangos in the booths until dawn, then wandered  about the beach, too curious over the movements of the American squadron  to go to bed; shopkeepers, black and rusty of face, smoking big pipes  with the air of philosophers; Indians clad in a single garment of  calico, falling in a straight line from the neck; eagle-beaked old  crones with black shawls over their heads; children wearing only a smock  twisted about their little waists and tied in a knot behind; a few  American residents, glancing triumphantly at each other; caballeros,  gay in the silken attire of summer, sitting in angry disdain upon their  plunging, superbly trapped horses; last of all, the elegant women in  their lace mantillas and flowered rebosas, weeping and clinging to each  other. Few gave ear to the reading of Sloat's proclamation.    
Benicia, the daughter of Dona Eustaquia, raised her clasped hands, the  tears streaming from her eyes. "Oh, these Americans! How I hate them!"  she cried, a reflection of her mother's violent spirit on her sweet  face.    
Dona Eustaquia caught the girl's hands and flung herself upon her neck.  "Ay! California! California!" she cried wildly. "My country is flung to  its knees in the dirt."    
A rose from the upper corridor of the Custom-house struck her daughter  full in the face.
