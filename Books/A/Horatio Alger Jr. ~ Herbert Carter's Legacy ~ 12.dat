  Squire Leech was reluctant to give up his intended purchase. He had  an  idea that Herbert stood in the way, and he contrived to call upon  the  widow in the course of the following week, at a time when he knew  our  hero was away from home. 
  But he failed again. 
  &#8220;I'm very sorry to go contrary to your advice, Squire Leech,&#8221; said   Mrs. Carter, deprecatingly, &#8220;but I can't give up my home. Herbert,   too, would be very much disappointed.&#8221; 
  &nbsp;&#8220;I hope you will not allow yourself to be guided by the judgment  of  an inexperienced boy, ma'am,&#8221; said the squire, mortified. 
  &#8220;I think I ought to consult my boy's wishes,&#8221; said the widow. 
  &#8220;He doesn't know what is best for him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Perhaps not; but I feel with him at present. I'm sorry to  disappoint  you, Squire Leech.&#8221; 
  &#8220;As to that, ma'am, I have no interest in the matter. I was only   advising you for your good.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm sure I'm much obliged to you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;In fact, as your means are limited, I will stretch a point, and  offer  you fifty dollars more. I shouldn't be at all sure of getting my  money  back.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you; but I think we'll keep the house for the present. If I   should find we couldn't afford it, I will let you know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't agree to keep to my offer after this week. 'Now or never'  is  my motto. I can draw the papers right out.&#8221; 
  The widow shook her head, and reiterated in gentle tones her  refusal.  Squire Leech was provoked, and did not hide his feeling. As  he only  proposed to take the house to oblige her, as he represented,  Mrs.  Carter was surprised at his display of feeling. She was not a  shrewd  woman, and it did not occur to her that he had any selfish  object in  view in his advice. 
  &#8220;I didn't succeed, Mr. Banks,&#8221; said the squire to his  superintendent.  &#8220;That Carter woman is dreadfully obstinate. Between  ourselves, I judge  it's her son that influences her.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think I have seen him&#8212;a boy of fourteen or fifteen.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, he's a very self-willed boy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You said you thought you would be able to foreclose, on account of   their failing to pay the interest.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They paid it. I was surprised at their promptness, till I learned   from my son that they had received a legacy of a hundred dollars or so   from a relative.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That won't last always.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, the time will come when I can get the place on my own terms. I  am  determined to have it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then Brown will have to find a different house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; I have heard of an old house that will do temporarily, till I   get the widow Carter's. It's a little out of the village, and is in   rather a dilapidated condition, but it will do for a few months or a   year, and that will fetch round the Carters.&#8221; 
  The house referred to was secured, and the superintendent's cousin   moved to Wrayburn. But neither the squire nor Mr. Banks forgave   Herbert for his assumed instrumentality in thwarting their plans. 
  The next winter Mrs. Carter was unfortunate enough to be laid up  with  severe sickness from December to March. Herbert devoted himself  to her  comfort, and performed nearly all his mother's customary work.  Washing  and ironing, however, he was obliged to have done. When the  sickness  commenced, the hundred dollars left by his uncle was  unbroken, but for  three months neither he nor, of course, his mother,  was able to earn  anything of any amount, while their expenses were  necessarily  increased. 
  At the opening of April, Herbert had the satisfaction of seeing his   mother, fully recovered, assume her usual place in the little   household. This was pleasant, but there was a drawback to his   satisfaction. The legacy had dwindled to twenty-five dollars. 
  He reported this to his mother. 
  &#8220;How unlucky that I should have been sick so long!&#8221; said Mrs.  Carter,  sighing. 
  &#8220;How lucky we had the legacy to fall back upon!&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;I don't know how we could have got along without that, truly.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Mother, I must look about for work. I ought to be earning four or   five dollars a week at my age.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You are only fifteen.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But I am stout and strong of my age. I shall soon be a man. Don't  you  see my mustache coming, mother?&#8221; said Herbert, with a laugh. 
  &#8220;Not very distinctly; but perhaps my eyesight is growing poor,&#8221;   answered his mother, smiling. 
  &#8220;The trouble is,&#8221; said Herbert, thoughtfully, &#8220;there is very little   chance of work in this town.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wonder whether Squire Leech wouldn't hire you through the spring   and summer on one of his farms. I heard that he is going to hire a   boy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am not sure whether he would be willing to hire me, however much  he  wanted a boy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Why not?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He don't seem to like me, nor does Mr. Banks like me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What can they have against you? I thought everybody liked you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's because you are my mother, but the squire doesn't feel   maternal so far as I am concerned. I didn't understand it at first,   but now I do.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;You remember the squire tried hard to get you to sell this place.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That was last year.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And you wouldn't sell. That is why he is angry with both of us.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But I don't understand why he should be,&#8221; said the widow,  innocently.  &#8220;He said he would take it only as a favor to me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That was all 'gammon.' Excuse the word, which isn't very elegant,  I  admit, but it's the right word for all that. The squire wanted the   place very much.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What could he do with it? He couldn't live in it himself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not much. I can imagine the look of disgust James's face would  wear  at the idea of such a thing. He wanted it for Nahum Brown, who  lives  in the old house up the road. You know Brown, who is a cousin of  Mr.  Banks, the superintendent, and he is very anxious to get hold of  our  house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How did you learn all this, Herbert? I never knew it before.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Tom Banks let it out one day.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't see how the squire can dislike us for wanting to stay in  our  old home.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There are a good many things you don't understand&#8212;about selfish  men  &#8212;mother. That is why I am afraid it won't be much use to ask the   squire for employment.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You may be mistaken about his feelings, Herbert.&#8221; 
  &#8220;At any rate, I'll go to him, if I can't find employment anywhere  else  in the village.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish you would, that is, if you don't think farm work will be  too  hard for you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'll risk that.&#8221; 
  In pursuance of this promise, Herbert, after ascertaining that  there  was no work to be had anywhere else in the village, called one  fine  morning at the imposing residence of Squire Leech. 
  James was in the yard, at work on a kite. 
  &#8220;Have you come to see me?&#8221; said James, superciliously. 
  &#8220;No; I wanted to see your father.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What about?&#8221; 
  Herbert was about to answer &#8220;on business,&#8221; but it occurred to him  that  it would be better policy to keep on friendly terms with James,  and he  said: &#8220;I am looking for work, and I thought he might have some  for  me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Perhaps so,&#8221; said James, patronizingly. &#8220;Of course, one in your   position must work for a living.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't you expect to work?&#8221; asked Herbert, in some curiosity. 
  &#8220;Not with my hands, of course,&#8221; said James. &#8220;I may study some  genteel  profession, such as law.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am too poor to be genteel,&#8221; said Herbert, amused. 
  &#8220;Of course. You will probably be a day laborer.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I hope to rise to something better in time,&#8221; said Herbert. &#8220;For  the  present I shall be glad to work by the day, or the month, if your   father will engage me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think my father is at home; you can ring and see,&#8221; said James,  who  could be kind to one who was willing to acknowledge his  inferiority. 
  Herbert rang the bell, and was ushered into the presence of Squire   Leech, who was examining some papers in the back parlor.
