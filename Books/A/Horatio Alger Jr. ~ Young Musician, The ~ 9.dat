    There was no room for Zeke to ride&#8212;that is, there was no seat for   him&#8212;but he managed to clamber into the back part of the wagon,  where  he sat, or squatted, rather uncomfortably, but evidently in  the best  of spirits&#8212;if any inference could be drawn from his  expression. 
  The poorhouse was not far away. It was a three-story frame house,   which badly needed painting, with a dilapidated barn, and shed near   by. 
  A three-story farmhouse is not common in the country, but this   dwelling had been erected by a Mr. Parmenter, in the expectation of   making a fortune by taking summer boarders. 
  There was room enough for them, but they did not come. The  situation  was the reverse of pleasant, the soil about was barren, and  there  were no shade or fruit trees. It was a crazy idea, selecting  such a  spot for a summer boarding-house, and failure naturally  resulted. 
  There had, indeed, been two boarders&#8212;a man and his wife&#8212;who paid   one week's board, and managed to owe six before the unlucky landlord   decided that they were a pair of swindlers. He had spent more money   than he could afford on his house, and went steadily behind-hand  year  after year, till the town&#8212;which was in want of a  poorhouse&#8212;stepped  in and purchased the house and farm at a bargain.  So it came to be a  boarding-house, after all, but in a sense not  contemplated by the  proprietor, and, at present, accommodated eleven  persons&#8212;mostly old  and infirm&#8212;whom hard fortune compelled to  subsist on charity. 
  Mr. Tucker had this advantage, that his boarders, had no recourse   except to stay with him, however poor his fare or harsh his   treatment, unless they were in a position to take care of  themselves. 
  When Philip came in sight of the almshouse&#8212;which he had often  seen,  and always considered a very dreary-looking building&#8212;he was   strengthened in his determination not long to remain a tenant. 
  Mr. Tucker drove up to the front door with a flourish. 
  A hard-featured woman came out, and regarded the contents of the   wagon with curiosity. 
  &quot;Well, Abigail, can you take another boarder!&quot; asked Mr. Tucker, as   he descended from the wagon. 
  &quot;Who is it?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, it ain't likely to be Squire Pope!&quot; said Joe facetiously;   &quot;and Zeke and I are regular boarders on the free list.&quot; 
  &quot;Is it that boy?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; it's Phil Gray.&quot; 
  &quot;Humph! boys are a trial!&quot; remarked Mrs. Tucker, whose experience   with Zeke had doubtless convinced her of this fact. 
  &quot;I sha'n't trouble you long, Mrs. Tucker,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I don't   intend to stay.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't, hey?&quot; retorted Joe Tucker, with a wolfish grin and an   emphatic nod of the head. &quot;We'll see about that&#8212;won't we, Squire   Pope?&quot; 
  &quot;The boy is rather rebellious, Mrs. Tucker,&quot; said the selectman.  &quot;He  appears to think he knows better what is good for him than we do.   You may look upon him as a permanent boarder. What he says is of no   account.&quot; 
  Philip said nothing, but he looked full at the squire with an   unflinching gaze. If ever determination was written upon any face,  it  was on his. 
  &quot;Come down there!&quot; said Mrs. Tucker, addressing our hero. &quot;You're  at  home now.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Dunbar won't know what has become of me,&quot; said Philip, with a   sudden thought. &quot;They will be anxious. May I go back there and tell   them where I am?&quot; 
  &quot;Do you think I am green enough for that?&quot; Mr. Tucker, touching the   side of his nose waggishly. &quot;We shouldn't be likely to set eyes on   you again.&quot; 
  &quot;I will promise to come back here this evening,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;And will you promise to stay?&quot; asked Squire Pope doubtfully. 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; answered Philip boldly. &quot;I won't do that, but I will   engage to come back. Then Mr. Tucker will have to look out for me,   for I tell you and him frankly I don't mean to stay.&quot; 
  &quot;Did you ever hear such talk, squire!&quot; asked Mr. Tucker, with a  gasp  of incredulity. &quot;He actually defies you, who are a selectman and  an  overseer of the poor.&quot; 
  &quot;So he does, Mr. Tucker. I'm shocked at his conduct.&quot; 
  &quot;Shall we let him go?&quot; 
  &quot;No, of course not.&quot; 
  &quot;I agree with you, squire. I know'd you wouldn't agree to it. What   shall I do about his wantin' to run away?&quot; 
  &quot;It will be best to confine him just at first, Mr. Tucker.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll shut him up in one of the attic rooms,&quot; said Mr. Tucker. 
  &quot;I think it will be the best thing to do, Mr. Tucker.&quot; 
  Philip took all this very coolly. As to the way in which they   proposed to dispose of him for the present he cared very little, as   he did not intend stay till morning if there was any possible chance   of getting away. The only thing that troubled him was the doubt and   anxiety of his good friends, the Dunbars, when he did not return to   the house. 
  &quot;Squire Pope,&quot; he said, turning to that official, &quot;will you do me a   favor?&quot; 
  &quot;Ahem! Explain yourself,&quot; said the squire suspiciously. 
  &quot;Will you call at Mr. Dunbar's and tell them where I am.&quot; 
  Now, for obvious reasons, the squire did not like to do this. He   knew that the Dunbars would manifest great indignation at the   arbitrary step which he had adopted, and he did not like to face   their displeasure, especially as his apology would perforce be a  lame  one. 
  &quot;I don't think I am called upon to do you a favor, seeing how  you've  acted, Philip,&quot; he said hesitatingly. &quot;Besides, it would be out  of  my way, and I ought to get home as soon as possible.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you refuse, sir?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I'd rather not.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you get word to them, Mr. Tucker?&quot; asked Philip, turning to   him. 
  &quot;I hain't got time,&quot; answered Mr. Tucker, who feared that the   Dunbars would come for Philip and release him in the course of the   evening. 
  Philip was nonplused. Always considerate of the feelings of others,   he was unwilling that his friends should suffer anxiety on his   account. 
  As Mr. Tucker and Squire Pope walked away together, our hero turned   to Zeke. 
  &quot;I suppose it's no use to ask you to do me a favor, Zeke?&quot; he said. 
  &quot;Do you want me to tell Frank Dunbar where you are?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I wish you would.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I'll do it.&quot; 
  &quot;You're a better fellow than I thought you were, Zeke,&quot; said  Philip,  surprised. 
  &quot;No, I ain't! Do you want to know why I'm willin' to go?&quot; 
  &quot;Why?&quot; 
  &quot;I know Frank Dunbar'll feel bad, and I hate him.&quot; 
  &quot;So that is your object, is it, Zeke?&quot; 
  &quot;You've got it.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, whatever your motive may be, I shall be much obliged to you   if you go. Here's ten cents for you!&quot; 
  Zeke grasped at the coin with avidity, for his father was very   parsimonious, and his mother no less so, and he seldom got any ready   money. 
  &quot;Thank you!&quot; said Zeke, with unusual politeness. &quot;I'll go right  off.  But, I say, don't you tell dad where I've gone, or he might  prevent  me, and don't you let on you've given me this dime, or he'd  try to  get it away.&quot; 
  &quot;No, I won't say anything about it,&quot; answered Philip. 
  &quot;A curious family this is!&quot; he thought, &quot;There doesn't seem to be   much confidence in each other.&quot; 
  Zeke sauntered away carelessly, to avert suspicion but when he had   got round a bend of the road he increased his speed, never looking   back, lest he should see his father signaling for him. 
  Philip breathed a sigh of relief. 
  &quot;I've got a messenger at last,&quot; he said. &quot;Now my friends will know   what has become of me when I don't come home to supper.&quot; 
  He was a little curious to learn what they were going to do with   him, but he was not long kept in suspense.
