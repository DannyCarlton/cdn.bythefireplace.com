One by one they go<br> Into the unknown dark--<br> Star-lit brows of the brave,<br> Voices that drew men's souls.<br> Rich is the land, O Death!<br> Can give you dead like our dead!--<br> Such as he from whose hand<br> The magic web of romance<br> Slipt, and the art was lost!<br> Such as he who erewhile--<br> The last of the Titan brood--<br> With his thunder the Senate shook;<br> Or he who, beside the Charles,<br> Untoucht of envy or hate,<br> Tranced the world with his song;<br> Or that other, that gray-eyed seer<br> Who in pastoral Concord ways<br> With Plato and Hafiz walked.

Not of these was the man<br> Whose wraith, through the mists of night,<br> Through the shuddering wintry stars,<br> Has passed to eternal morn.<br> Fit were the moan of the sea<br> And the clashing of cloud on cloud<br> For the passing of that soul! 
Ever he faced the storm!<br> No weaver of rare romance,<br> No patient framer of laws,<br> No maker of wondrous rhyme,<br> No bookman wrapt in his dream.<br> His was the voice that rang<br> In the fight like a bugle-call,<br> And yet could be tender and low<br> As when, on a night in June,<br> The hushed wind sobs in the pines.<br> His was the eye that flashed<br> With a sabre's azure gleam,<br> Pointing to heights unwon!

Not for him were these days<br> Of clerkly and sluggish calm--<br> To the petrel the swooping gale!<br> Austere he seemed, but the hearts<br> Of all men beat in his breast;<br> No fetter but galled his wrist,<br> No wrong that was not his own.<br> What if those eloquent lips<br> Curled with the old-time scorn?<br> What if in needless hours<br> His quick hand closed on the hilt?<br> 'Twas the smoke from the well-won fields<br> That clouded the veteran's eyes.<br> A fighter this to the end! 
Ah, if in coming times<br> Some giant evil arise,<br> And Honor falter and pale,<br> His were a name to conjure with!<br> God send his like again!
