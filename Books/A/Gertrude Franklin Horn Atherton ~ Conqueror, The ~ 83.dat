The sunlight moved along the table and danced on Hamilton's papers,  flecking them and slanting into his eyes. He went to the window to draw  the shade, and stood laughing, forgetting the grave anxieties which  animated his pen this morning. In the garden without, his son Alexander  and young Philip Schuyler, his wife's orphan nephew, who lived with him,  were pounding each other vigorously, while Philip, Angelica, Theodosia  Burr, and Gouverneur Morris sat on the fence and applauded.    
"What a blessed provision for letting off steam," he thought, with some  envy. "I would I had Burr in front of my fists this moment. I suppose he  is nothing but the dupe of Jefferson, but he is a terrible menace, all  the same."    
The girls saw him, and leaping from the fence ran to the house, followed  more leisurely by Morris.    
"You are loitering," exclaimed Angelica, triumphantly, as she entered  the room without ceremony, followed by Theodosia. "And when you loiter  you belong to me."    
She had grown tall, and was extremely thin and nervous, moving  incessantly. But her face, whether stormy, dreamy, or animated with the  pleasure of the moment, was very beautiful. Theodosia Burr was a  handsome intellectual girl, with a massive repose; and the two were much  in harmony.    
"If I snatch a moment to breathe," Hamilton was beginning, when he  suddenly caught two right hands and spread them open.    
"What on earth does this mean?" he demanded. The little paws of the two  most fastidious girls he knew were dyed with ink. Both blushed vividly,  but Angelica flung back her head with her father's own action.    
"We are writing a novel," she said.    
"You are doing what?" gasped Hamilton.    
"Yes, sir. All the girls in New York are. Why shouldn't we? I guess we  inherit brains enough."    
"All the girls in New York are writing novels!" exclaimed Hamilton. "Is  this the next result of Jacobinism and unbridled liberty, the next  development of the new Americanism as expounded by Thomas Jefferson?  Good God! What next?"    
"You have the prophetic eye," said Morris, who was seated on the edge of  the table, grinning sardonically. (He was bald now, and looked more  wicked than ever.) "What of woman in the future?"    
"She has given me sufficient occupation in the present," replied  Hamilton, drily. "Heaven preserve me from the terrors of anticipation."  "Well, finish your novel. If you confine your pens to those subjects of  which you know nothing, you will enjoy yourselves; and happiness should  be sought in all legitimate channels. But as a favour to me, keep your  hands clean."    
The girls retired with some hauteur, and Morris said impatiently:--    
"I thought I had left that sort of thing behind me in France, where  Madame de Stael drove me mad. I return to find all the prettiest women  running to lectures on subjects which they never can understand, and  scarifying the men's nerves with pedantic allusions. I always believed  that our women were the brightest on the planet, but that they should  ever have the bad taste to become intellectual--well, I have known but  one woman who could do it successfully, and that is Mrs. Croix. What has  she to do with this sudden activity of Burr's? Is he handling French  money?"    
"Are you convinced that she is a French spy?"    
"I believe it so firmly that her sudden departure would reconcile me to  the Alien law. Where has Burr found the money for this campaign? He is  bankrupt; he hasn't a friend among the leaders; I don't believe the  Manhattan Bank, for all that he is the father of it, will let him  handle a cent, and Jefferson distrusts and despises him. Still, it is  just possible that Jefferson is using him, knowing that the result of  the Presidential election will turn on New York, and that after himself  Burr is the best politician in the country. I doubt if he would trust  him with a cent of his own money, but he may have an understanding with  the Aspasia of Bowling Green. Certainly she must have the full  confidence of France by this time, and she is the cleverest Jacobin in  the country."    
"I wish that dark system could be extirpated, root and branch," said  Hamilton. "I have been too occupied these past two years to watch her,  or Burr either, for that matter. Organizing an army, and working for  your bread in spare moments, gives your enemies a clear field for  operations. I have had enough to do, watching Adams. Burr has stolen a  march that certainly does credit to his cunning. That is the most  marvellous faculty I know. He is barely on speaking terms with a  leader--Jefferson, Clinton, the Livingstons, all turned their backs upon  him long since, as a man neither to be trusted nor used. The fraud by  which he obtained the charter of the Manhattan Bank has alienated so  many of his followers that his entire ticket was beaten at the last  elections. Now he will have himself returned for the Assembly from  Orange, he is manipulating the lower orders of New York as if they were  so much wax, using their secrets, wiping the babies' noses, and hanging  upon the words of every carpenter who wants to talk: and has actually  got Clinton--who has treated him like a dog for years--to let him use  his name as a possible candidate for the Legislature. Doubtless he may  thank Mrs. Croix for that conquest. But his whole work is marvellous,  and I suppose it would be well if we had a man on our side who would  stoop to the same dirty work. I should as soon invite a strumpet to my  house. But I am fearful for the result. With this Legislature we should  be safe. But Burr has converted hundreds, if not thousands, to a party  for which he cares as much as he does for the Federal. If he succeeds,  and the next Legislature is Republican, Jefferson will be the third  President of the Unites States, and then, God knows what. Not immediate  disunion, possibly, for Jefferson is cunning enough to mislead France  for his own purposes; nor can he fail to see that Jacobinism is on the  wane--but a vast harvest of democracy, of disintegration, and  denationalization, which will work the same disaster in the end. If Burr  could be taught that he is being made a tool of, he might desist, for he  would work for no party without hope of reward. He may ruin us and gain  nothing."    
"It is a great pity we have not a few less statesmen in our party and a  few more politicians. When we began life, only great services were  needed; and the Opposition, being engaged in the same battle of ideas,  fought us with a merely inferior variety of our own weapons. But the  greatest of our work is over, and the day of the politician has dawned.  Unfortunately, the party of this damned lag-bellied Virginian has the  monopoly. Burr is the natural result and the proudest sample of the  French Revolution and its spawn. But your personal influence is  tremendous. Who can say how many infuscated minds you will illumine when  it comes to speech-making. Don't set your brow in gloom."    
"I have not the slightest intention of despairing. The deep and never  ceasing methods of the Jacobin Scandal Club have weakened my influence  with the masses, however; no doubt of that. Its policy is to iterate and  reiterate, pay no attention to denials, but drop the same poison daily  until denial is forgotten and men's minds are so accustomed to the  detraction, belittling, or accusation, that they accept it as they  accept the facts of existence. Jefferson has pursued this policy with my  reputation for ten years. During the last eight he has been ably abetted  by Mrs. Croix, his other personal agents, and those of France. Now they  have enlisted Burr, and there is no better man for their work in the  country."    
"They know that if you go, the party follows. That is their policy, and  may they spend the long evening of time in Hell. But I believe you will  be more than a match for them yet; although this is by far the most  serious move the enemy has made." "I wish to Heaven I had persisted in  the Great Convention until I carried my point in regard to having the  electors chosen by the people in districts. Then I should snap my  fingers at Burr in this campaign, for he is an indifferent speaker, and  political manipulation would count for very little. With C.C. Pinckney  in the chair for eight years, I should feel that the country was planted  on reasonably sure foundations. It must be Adams and Pinckney, of  course, but with proper harmony Pinckney will carry the day. Rather  Jefferson in the chair than Adams--an open army that we can fight with a  united front, than a Federal dividing the ranks, and forcing us to  uphold him for the honour of the party--to say nothing of being  responsible for him."    
"Jefferson is the less of several evils--Burr, for instance."    
"Oh, Burr!" exclaimed Hamilton. "I should be in my dotage if Burr became  President of the United States. Personally, I have nothing against him,  and he is one of the most agreeable and accomplished of men. Theodosia  half lives here. Perhaps no man ever hated another as I hate Jefferson,  nor had such cause. He has embittered my life and ruined my health; he  has made me feel like a lost soul more than once. But better Jefferson a  thousand times than Burr. God knows I hate democracy and fear it, but  Jefferson is timid and cautious, and has some principles and patriotism;  moreover, a desire for fame. Burr has neither patriotism nor a  principle, nor the least regard for his good name. He is bankrupt,  profligate--he has been living in the greatest extravagance at Richmond  Hill, and his makings at the bar, although large, are far exceeded by  his expenses; there is always a story afloat about some dark transaction  of his, and never disproved: he challenged Church for talking openly  about the story that the Holland Land Company had, for legislative  services rendered, cancelled a bond against him for twenty thousand  dollars; but the world doubts Burr's bluster as it doubts his word. At  present he is in a desperate way because Alexander Baring, in behalf of  a friend, I.I. Augustine, is pressing for payment on a bond given to  secure the price of land bought by Burr and Greenleaf, and he has been  offering worthless land claims in settlement, and resorting to every  artifice to avert a crisis. Baring wanted me to take the case, but of  course I wouldn't touch it. I sent him to Rinnan. The man is literally  at the end of his tether. It is a coup or extinction--failure means  flight or debtor's prison. Furthermore, he is a conspirator by nature,  and there is no man in the country with such extravagant tastes, who is  so unscrupulous as to the means of gratifying them. He is half mad for  power and wealth. The reins of state in his hands, and he would stop at  nothing which might give him control of the United States Treasury. To  be President of the United States would mean nothing to him except as a  highway to empire, to unlimited power and plunder. We have been  threatened with many disasters since we began our career, but with no  such menace as Burr. But unless I die between now and eighteen hundred  and one, Burr will lose the great game, although he may give victory to  the Republican party."    
"I am not surprised at your estimate and revelations," said Morris, "for  I have heard much the same from others since my return. It was this  certainty that he is bankrupt that led me to believe he was handling  French money in this election--and he is flinging it right and left in a  manner that must gratify his aspiring soul. Considering his lack of  fortune and family influence, he has done wonders in the way of  elevating himself. This makes it the more remarkable that with his great  cleverness he should not have done better--"    
"He is not clever; that is the point. He is cunning. His is wholly the  brain of the conspirator. Were he clever, he would, like Thomas  Jefferson, fool himself and the world into the belief that he is honest.  Intellect and statesmanship he holds in contempt. He would elevate  himself by the Catiline system, by the simple method of proclaiming  himself emperor, and appropriating the moneybags of the country. There  is not one act of statesmanship to his credit. To him alone, of all  prominent Americans, the country is indebted for nothing. The other  night at a dinner, by the way, he toasted first the French Revolution,  then Bonaparte. It is more than possible that you are right, for France,  whether Directory or Consulate, is not likely to change her policy  regarding this country. Nothing would please either Talleyrand or  Bonaparte better than to inflame us into a civil war, then swoop down  upon us, under the pretence of coming to the rescue. Burr would be just  the man to play into their hands, although with no such intention.  Jefferson is quite clever enough to foil them, if he found that more to  his interest. Well, neither is elected yet. Let us hope for the best. Go  and ask Angelica to play for you. I have letters to write to leaders all  over the State."
