These old houses have perhaps detained us too long. They are  merely the crumbling shells of things dead and gone, of persons  and manners and customs that have left no very distinct record of  themselves, excepting here and there in some sallow manuscript  which has luckily escaped the withering breath of fire, for the  old town, as I have remarked, has managed, from the earliest  moment of its existence, to burn itself up periodically. It is  only through the scattered memoranda of ancient town clerks, and  in the files of worm-eaten and forgotten newspapers, that we are  enabled to get glimpses of that life which was once so real and  positive and has now become a shadow. I am of course speaking of  the early days of the settlement on Strawberry Bank. They were  stormy and eventful days. The dense forest which surrounded the  clearing was alive with hostile red-men. The sturdy pilgrim went  to sleep with his firelock at his bedside, not knowing at what  moment he might be awakened by the glare of his burning hayricks  and the piercing war-whoops of the Womponoags. Year after year he  saw his harvest reaped by a sickle of flames, as he peered  through the loop-holes of the blockhouse, whither he had flown in  hot haste with goodwife and little ones. The blockhouse at  Strawberry Bank appears to have been on an extensive scale, with  stockades for the shelter of cattle. It held large supplies of  stores, and was amply furnished with arquebuses, sakers, and  murtherers, a species of naval ordnance which probably did not  belie its name. It also boasted, we are told, of two drums for  training-days, and no fewer than fifteen hautboys and soft-voiced  recorders--all which suggests a mediaeval castle, or a grim  fortress in the time of Queen Elizabeth. To the younger members  of the community glass or crockery ware was an unknown substance;  to the elders it was a memory. An iron pot was the  pot-of-all-work, and their table utensils were of beaten pewter.  The diet was also of the simplest--pea-porridge and corn-cake,  with a mug of ale or a flagon of Spanish wine, when they could  get it.    
John Mason, who never resided in this country, but delegated the  management of his plantation at Ricataqua and Newichewannock to  stewards, died before realizing any appreciable return from his  enterprise. He spared no endeavor meanwhile to further its  prosperity. In 1632, three years before his death, Mason sent  over from Denmark a number of neat cattle, "of a large breed and  yellow colour." The herd thrived, and it is said that some of the  stock is still extant on farms in the vicinity of Portsmouth.  Those old first families had a kind of staying quality!    
In May, 1653, the inhabitants of the settlement petitioned the  General Court at Boston to grant them a definite township--for  the boundaries were doubtful--and the right to give it a proper  name. "Whereas the name of this plantation att present being  Strabery Banke, accidentlly soe called, by reason of a banke  where strawberries was found in this place, now we humbly desire  to have it called Portsmouth, being a name most suitable for this  place, it being the river's mouth, and good as any in this land,  and your petit'rs shall humbly pray," etc.    
Throughout that formative period, and during the intermittent  French wars, Portsmouth and the outlying districts were the  scenes of bloody Indian massacres. No portion of the New England  colony suffered more. Famine, fire, pestilence, and war, each in  turn, and sometimes in conjunction, beleaguered the little  stronghold, and threatened to wipe it out. But that was not to  be.    
The settlement flourished and increased in spite of all, and as  soon as it had leisure to draw breath, it bethought itself of the  school-house and the jail--two incontestable signs of budding  civilization. At a town meeting in 1662, it was ordered "that a  cage be made or some other meanes invented by the selectmen to  punish such as sleepe or take tobacco on the Lord's day out of  the meetinge in the time of publique service." This salutary  measure was not, for some reason, carried into effect until nine  years later, when Captain John Pickering, who seems to have had  as many professions as Michelangelo, undertook to construct a  cage twelve feet square and seven feet high, with a pillory on  top; "the said Pickering to make a good strong dore and make a  substantiale payre of stocks and places the same in said cage." A  spot conveniently near the west end on the meeting-house was  selected as the site for this ingenious device. It is more than  probable that "the said Pickering" indirectly furnished an  occasional bird for his cage, for in 1672 we find him and one  Edward Westwere authorized by the selectmen to "keepe houses of  publique entertainment." He was a versatile individual, this John  Pickering--soldier, miller, moderator, carpenter, lawyer, and  innkeeper. Michelangelo need not blush to be bracketed with him.  In the course of a long and variegated career he never failed to  act according to his lights, which he always kept well trimmed.  That Captain Pickering subsequently became the grandfather, at  several removes, of the present writer was no fault of the  Captain's, and should not be laid up against him.    
Down to 1696, the education of the young appears to have been a  rather desultory and tentative matter; "the young idea" seems to  have been allowed to "shoot" at whatever it wanted to; but in  that year it was voted "that care be taken that an abell  scollmaster [skullmaster!] be provided for the towen as the law  directs, not visious in conversation." That was perhaps demanding  too much; for it was not until "May ye7" of the following year  that the selectmen were fortunate enough to put their finger on  this rara avis in the person of Mr. Tho. Phippes, who agreed "to  be scollmaster for the the towen this yr insewing for teaching  the inhabitants children in such manner as other schollmasters  yously doe throughout the countrie: for his soe doinge we the  sellectt men in behalfe of ower towen doe ingage to pay him by  way of rate twenty pounds and yt he shall and may reserve from  every father or master that sends theyer children to school this  yeare after ye rate of 16s. for readers, writers and cypherers  20s., Lattiners 24s."    
Modern advocates of phonetic spelling need not plume themselves  on their originality. The town clerk who wrote that delicious  "yously doe" settles the question. It is to be hoped that Mr.  Tho. Phippes was not only "not visious in conversation," but was  more conventional in his orthography. He evidently gave  satisfaction, and clearly exerted an influence on the town clerk,  Mr. Samuel Keais, who ever after shows a marked improvement in  his own methods. In 1704 the town empowered the selectmen "to  call and settell a gramer scoll according to ye best of yower  judgement and for ye advantag [Keais is obviously dead now] of ye  youth of ower town to learn them to read from ye primer, to  wright and sypher and to learne ym the tongues and good-manners."  On this occasion it was Mr. William Allen, of Salisbury, who  engaged "dilligently to attend ye school for ye present yeare,  and tech all childern yt can read in thaire psallters and  upward." From such humble beginnings were evolved some of the  best public high schools at present in New England.    
Portsmouth did not escape the witchcraft delusion, though I  believe that no hangings took place within the boundaries of the  township. Dwellers by the sea are generally superstitious;  sailors always are. There is something in the illimitable expanse  of sky and water that dilates the imagination. The folk who live  along the coast live on the edge of a perpetual mystery; only a  strip of yellow sand or gray rock separates them from the  unknown; they hear strange voices in the winds at midnight, they  are haunted by the spectres of the mirage. Their minds quickly  take the impress of uncanny things. The witches therefore found a  sympathetic atmosphere in Newscastle, at the mouth of the  Piscataqua--that slender paw of land which reaches out into the  ocean and terminates in a spread of sharp, flat rocks, lie the  claws of an amorous cat. What happened to the good folk of that  picturesque little fishing-hamlet is worth retelling in brief. In  order properly to retell it, a contemporary witness shall be  called upon to testify in the case of the Stone-Throwing Devils  of Newcastle. It is the Rev. Cotton Mather who addresses you--   "On June 11, 1682, showers of stones were thrown by an invisible  hand upon the house of George Walton at Portsmouth [Newcastle was  then a part of the town]. Whereupon the people going out found  the gate wrung off the hinges, and stones flying and falling  thick about them, and striking of them seemingly with a great  force, but really affecting 'em no more than if a soft touch were  given them. The glass windows were broken by the stones that came  not from without, but from within; and other instruments were in  a like manner hurled about. Nine of the stones they took up,  whereof some were as hot as if they came out of the fire; and  marking them they laid them on the table; but in a little while  they found some of them again flying about. The spit was carried  up the chimney, and coming down with the point forward, stuck in  the back log, from whence one of the company removing it, it was  by an invisible hand thrown out at the window. This disturbance  continued from day to day; and sometimes a dismal hollow  whistling would be heard, and sometimes the trotting and snorting  of a horse, but nothing to be seen. The man went up the Great Bay  in a boat on to a farm which he had there; but the stones found  him out, and carrying from the house to the boat a stirrup iron  the iron came jingling after him through the woods as far as his  house; and at last went away and was heard no more. The anchor  leaped overboard several times and stopt the boat. A cheese was  taken out of the press, and crumbled all over the floor; a piece  of iron stuck into the wall, and a kettle hung thereon. Several  cocks of hay, mow'd near the house, were taken up and hung upon  the trees, and others made into small whisps, and scattered about  the house. A man was much hurt by some of the stones. He was a  Quaker, and suspected that a woman, who charged him with  injustice in detaining some land from here, did, by witchcraft,  occasion these preternatural occurrences. However, at last they  came to an end."    
Now I have done with thee, O credulous and sour Cotton Mather! so  get thee back again to thy tomb in the old burying-ground on  Copp's Hill, where, unless thy nature is radically changed, thou  makest it uncomfortable for those about thee.    
Nearly a hundred years afterwards, Portsmouth had another  witch--a tangible witch in this instance--one Molly Bridget, who  cast her malign spell on the eleemosynary pigs at the Almshouse,  where she chanced to reside at the moment. The pigs were  manifestly bewitched, and Mr. Clement March, the superintendent  of the institution, saw only one remedy at hand, and that was to  cut off and burn the tips of their tales. But when the tips were  cut off they disappeared, and it was in consequence quite  impracticable to burn them. Mr. March, who was a gentleman of  expedients, ordered that all the chips and underbrush in the yard  should be made into heaps and consumed, hoping thus to catch and  do away with the mysterious and provoking extremities. The fires  were no sooner lighted than Molly Bridget rushed from room to  room in a state of frenzy. With the dying flames her own vitality  subsided, and she was dead before the ash-piles were cool. I say  it seriously when I say that these are facts of which there is  authentic proof.    
If the woman had recovered, she would have fared badly, even at  that late period, had she been in Salem; but the death-penalty  has never been hastily inflicted in Portsmouth. The first  execution that ever took place there was that of Sarah Simpson  and Penelope Kenny, for the murder of an infant in 1739. The  sheriff was Thomas Packer, the same official who, twenty-nine  years later, won unenviable notoriety at the hanging of Ruth  Blay. The circumstances are set forth by the late Albert Laighton  in a spirited ballad, which is too long to quote in full. The  following stanzas, however, give the pith of the story--    <blockquote>
 "And a voice among them shouted,<br>   "Pause before the deed is done;<br>   We have asked reprieve and pardon<br>   For the poor misguided one.'    
 "But these words of Sheriff Packer<br>   Rang above the swelling noise:<br>   'Must I wait and lose my dinner?<br>   Draw away the cart, my boys!'    
 "Nearer came the sound and louder,<br>   Till a steed with panting breath,<br>   From its sides the white foam dripping,<br>   Halted at the scene of death;    
 "And a messenger alighted,<br>   Crying to the crowd, 'Make way!<br>   This I bear to Sheriff Packer;<br>   'Tis a pardon for Ruth Blay!'"</blockquote>    
But of course he arrived too late--the Law led Mercy about twenty  minutes. The crowd dispersed, horror-stricken; but it assembled  again that night before the sheriff's domicile and expressed its  indignation in groans. His effigy, hanged on a miniature gallows,  was afterwards paraded through the streets.    <blockquote>
 "Be the name of Thomas Packer<br>   A reproach forevermore!"</blockquote>    
Laighton's ballad reminds me of that Portsmouth has been prolific  in poets, one of whom, at least, has left a mouthful of perennial  rhyme for orators--Jonathan Sewell with his    <blockquote>
 "No pent-up Utica contracts your powers,<br>   But the whole boundless continent is yours."</blockquote>    
I have somewhere seen a volume with the alliterative title of  "Poets of Portsmouth," in which are embalmed no fewer than sixty  immortals!    
But to drop into prose again, and have done with this iliad of  odds and ends. Portsmouth has the honor, I believe, of  establishing the first recorded pauper workhouse--though not in  connection with her poets, as might naturally be supposed. The  building was completed and tenanted in 1716. Seven years later,  an act was passed in England authorizing the establishment of  parish workhouses there. The first and only keeper of the  Portsmouth almshouse up to 1750 was a woman--Rebecca Austin.    
Speaking of first things, we are told by Mr. Nathaniel Adams, in  his "Annals of Portsmouth," that on the 20th of April, 1761, Mr.  John Stavers began running a stage from that town to Boston. The  carriage was a two-horse curricle, wide enough to accommodate  three passengers. The fare was thirteen shillings and sixpence  sterling per head. The curricle was presently superseded by a  series of fat yellow coaches, one of which--nearly a century  later, and long after that pleasant mode of travel had fallen  obsolete--was the cause of much mental tribulation (1. Some idle  reader here and there may possibly recall the burning of the old  stage-coach in The Story of a Bad Boy.) to the writer of this  chronicle.    
The mail and the newspaper are closely associated factors in  civilization, so I mention them together, though in this case the  newspaper antedated the mail-coach about five years. On October  7, 1756, the first number of "The New Hampshire Gazette and  Historical Chronicle" was issued in Portsmouth from the press of  Daniel Fowle, who in the previous July had removed from Boston,  where he had undergone a brief but uncongenial imprisonment on  suspicion of having printed a pamphlet entitled "The Monster of  Monsters, by Tom Thumb, Esq.," an essay that contained some  uncomplimentary reflections on several official personages.The  "Gazette" was the pioneer journal of the province. It was  followed at the close of the same year by "The Mercury and Weekly  Advertiser," published by a former apprentice of Fowle, a certain  Thomas Furber, backed by a number of restless Whigs, who  considered the "Gazette" not sufficiently outspoken in the cause  of liberty. Mr. Fowle, however, contrived to hold his own until  the day of his death. Fowle had for pressman a faithful negro  named Primus, a full-blooded African. Whether Primus was a  freeman or a slave I am unable to state. He lived to a great age,  and was a prominent figure among the people of his own color.    
Negro slavery was common in New England at that period. In 1767,  Portsmouth numbered in its population a hundred and eighty-eight  slaves, male and female. Their bondage, happily, was nearly  always of a light sort, if any bondage can be light. They were  allowed to have a kind of government of their own; indeed, were  encouraged to do so, and no unreasonable restrictions were placed  on their social enjoyment. They annually elected a king and  counselors, and celebrated the event with a procession. The  aristocratic feeling was highly developed in them. The rank of  the master was the slave's rank. There was a great deal of ebony  standing around on its dignity in those days. For example,  Governor Langdon's manservant, Cyrus Bruce, was a person who  insisted on his distinction, and it was recognized. His massive  gold chain and seals, his cherry-colored small-clothes and silk  stockings, his ruffles and silver shoe-buckles, were a tradition  long after Cyrus himself was pulverized.    
In cases of minor misdemeanor among them, the negros themselves  were permitted to be judge and jury. Their administration of  justice was often characteristically naive. Mr. Brewster gives an  amusing sketch of one of their sessions. King Nero is on the  bench, and one Cato--we are nothing if not classical--is the  prosecuting attorney. The name of the prisoner and the nature of  his offense are not disclosed to posterity. In the midst of the  proceedings the hour of noon is clanged from the neighboring  belfry of the Old North Church. "The evidence was not gone  through with, but the servants could stay no longer from their  home duties. They all wanted to see the whipping, but could not  conveniently be present again after dinner. Cato ventured to  address the King: Please you Honor, best let the fellow have his  whipping now, and finish the trial after dinner. The request  seemed to be the general wish of the company: so Nero ordered ten  lashes, for justice so far as the trial went, and ten more at the  close of the trial, should he be found guilty!"    
Slavery in New Hampshire was never legally abolished, unless  Abraham Lincoln did it. The State itself has not ever pronounced  any emancipation edict. During the Revolutionary War the slaves  were generally emancipated by their masters. That many of the  negros, who had grown gray in service, refused their freedom, and  elected to spend the rest of their lives as pensioners in the  families of their late owners, is a circumstance that illustrates  the kindly ties which held between slave and master in the old  colonial days in New England.    
The institution was accidental and superficial, and never had any  real root in the Granite State. If the Puritans could have found  in the Scriptures any direct sanction of slavery, perhaps it  would have continued awhile longer, for the Puritan carried his  religion into the business affairs of life; he was not even able  to keep it out of his bills of lading. I cannot close this  rambling chapter more appropriately and solemnly than by quoting  from one of those same pious bills of landing. It is dated June,  1726, and reads: "Shipped by the grace of God in good order and  well conditioned, by Wm. Pepperills on there own acct. and  risque, in and upon the good Briga called the William, whereof is  master under God for this present voyage George King, now riding  at anchor in the river Piscataqua and by God's grace bound to  Barbadoes." Here follows a catalogue of the miscellaneous cargo,  rounded off with: "And so God send the good Briga to her desired  port in safety. Amen."
