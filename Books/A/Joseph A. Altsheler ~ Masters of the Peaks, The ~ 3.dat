  Robert hoped for a fair morning. Surely Areskoui would relent now!  But the sun that crept languidly up the horizon was invisible to them,  hidden by a dark curtain of clouds that might shed, at any moment,  torrents of rain or hail or snow. The whole earth swam in chilly damp.  Banks of cold fog filled the valleys and gorges, and shreds and patches  of it floated along the peaks and ridges. The double fires had dried  his clothing and had sent warmth into his veins, increasing his  vitality somewhat, but it was far below normal nevertheless. He had an  immense aversion to further movement. He wanted to stay there between  the coals, awaiting passively whatever fate might have for him.  Somehow, his will to make an effort and live seemed to have gone.
  While weakness grew upon him and he drooped by the fire, he did not  feel hunger, but it was only a passing phase. Presently the desire for  food that had gnawed at him with sharp teeth came back, and with it his  wish to do, like one stirred into action by pain. Hunger itself was a  stimulus and his sinking vitality was arrested in its decline. He  looked around eagerly at the sodden scene, but it certainly held out  little promise of game. Deer and bear would avoid those steeps, and  range in the valleys. But the will to action, stimulated back to life,  remained. However comfortable it was between the fires they must not  stay there to perish.
  &#8220;Why don't we go on?&#8221; he said to Willet.
  &#8220;I'm glad to hear you ask that question,&#8221; replied the hunter.
  &#8220;Why, Dave?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because it shows that you haven't given up. If you've got the  courage to leave such a warm and dry place you've got the courage also  to make another fight for life. And you were the first to speak, too,  Robert.&#8221;
  &#8220;We must go on,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;But it is best to throw slush over  the fire and hide our traces.&#8221;
  The task finished they took up their vague journey, going they knew  not where, but knowing that they must go somewhere, their uncertain way  still leading along the crests of narrow ridges, across shallow dips  and through drooping forests, where the wind moaned miserably. At  intervals, it rained or snowed or hailed and once more they were wet  through and through. The recrudescence of Robert's strength was a mere  flare-up. His vitality ebbed again, and not even the fierce gnawing  hunger that refused to depart could stimulate it. By-and-by he began to  stumble, but Tayoga and Willet, who noticed it, said nothing&#8212;they  staggered at times themselves. They toiled on for hours in silence,  but, late in the afternoon, Robert turned suddenly to the Onondaga.
  &#8220;Do you remember, Tayoga,&#8221; he said, &#8220;something you said to me a  couple of days since, or was it a week, or maybe a month ago? I seem to  remember time very uncertainly, but you were talking about repasts,  banquets, Lucullan banquets, more gorgeous banquets than old Nero had,  and they say he was king of epicures. I think you spoke of tender  venison, and juicy bear steaks, and perhaps of a delicate broiled trout  from one of these clear mountain streams. Am I not right, Tayoga?  Didn't you mention viands? And perhaps you may still be thinking of  them?&#8221;
  &#8220;I<I> am</I>, Dagaeoga. I am thinking of them all the time. I  confess to you that I am so hungry I could gnaw the inside of the fresh  bark upon a tree, and if I were turned loose upon a deer, slain and  cooked, I could eat him all from the tip of his nose to the tip of his  tail.&#8221;
  &#8220;Stop, you boys,&#8221; said Willet sternly. &#8220;You only aggravate your  sufferings. Isn't that a valley to the right, Tayoga, and don't you  catch the gleam of a little lake among its trees?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a valley, Great Bear, and there<I> is</I> a small lake in the  center. We will go there. Perhaps we can catch fish.&#8221;
  Hope sprang up in Robert's heart. Fish? Why, of course there were  fish in all the mountain lakes! and they never failed to carry hooks  and lines in their packs. Bait could be found easily under the rocks.  He did not conceal his eagerness to descend into the valley and the  others were not less forward than he.
  The valley was about half a square mile in area, of which the lake  in the center occupied one-fourth, the rest being in dense forest. The  three soon had their lines in water, and they waited full of  anticipation, but they waited in vain until long after night had come.  Not one of the three received a bite. The lines floated idly.
  &#8220;Every lake in the mountains except one is full of fish&#8212;except  one!&#8221; exclaimed Robert bitterly, &#8220;and this is the one!&#8221;
  &#8220;No, it is not that,&#8221; said Tayoga gravely. &#8220;It means that the face  of Areskoui is still turned from us, that the good Sun God does not  relent for our unknown sin. We must have offended him deeply that he  should remain angry with us so long. This lake is swarming with fish,  like the others of the mountains, but he has willed that not one should  hang upon our hooks. Why waste time?&#8221;
  He drew his line from the water, wound it up carefully and replaced  it in his pack. The others, after a fruitless wait, imitated him,  convinced that he was right. Then, after infinite pains, as before,  they built two fires again, and slept between them. But the next  morning all three were weak. Their vitality had declined fast in the  night, and the situation became critical in the extreme.
  &#8220;We must find food or we die,&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;We might linger a long  time, but soon we won't have the strength to hunt, and then it would  only be a question of when the wolves took us.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can hear them howling now on the slopes,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;They know  we are here, and that our strength is declining. They will not face our  rifles, but will wait until we are too weak to use them.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is your plan, Dave?&#8221; asked Robert.
  &#8220;There must be game on the slopes. What say you, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;If Areskoui has willed for game to be there it will be there. He  will even send it to us. And perhaps he has decided that he has now  punished us enough.&#8221;
  &#8220;It certainly won't hurt for us to try, and perhaps we'd better  separate. Robert, you go west; Tayoga, you take the eastern slopes, and  I'll hunt toward the north. By night we'll all be back at this spot,  full-handed or empty-handed, as it may be, but full-handed, I hope.&#8221;
  He spoke cheerfully, and the others responded in like fashion.  Action gave them a mental and physical tonic, and bracing their weak  bodies they started in the direction allotted to each. Robert forgot,  for a little while, the terrible hunger that seemed to be preying upon  his very fiber, and, as he started away, showed an elasticity and  buoyancy of which he could not have dreamed himself capable five  minutes before.
  Westward stretched forest, lofty in the valley, high on the slopes  and everywhere dense. He plunged into it, and then looked back. Tayoga  and Willet were already gone from his sight, seeking what he sought.  Their experience in the wilderness was greater than his, and they were  superior to him in trailing, but he was very hopeful that it would be  his good fortune to find the game they needed so badly, the game they  must have soon, in truth, or perish.
  The valley was deep in slush and mire, and the water soaked through  his leggings and moccasins again, but he paid no attention to it now.  His new courage and strength lasted. Glancing up at the heavens he  beheld a little rift in the western clouds. A bar of light was let  through, and his mind, so imaginative, so susceptible to the influences  of earth and air, at once saw it as an omen. It was a pillar of fire to  him, and his faith was confirmed.
  &#8220;Areskoui is turning back his face, and he smiles upon us,&#8221; he said  to himself. Then looking carefully to his rifle, he held it ready for  an instant shot.
  He came to the westward edge of the valley, and found the slope  before him gentle but rocky. He paused there a while in indecision,  and, then glancing up again at the bar of light that had grown broader,  he murmured, so much had he imbibed the religion and philosophy of the  Iroquois:
  &#8220;O Areskoui, direct me which way to go.&#8221;
  The reply came, almost like a whisper in his ear:
  &#8220;Try the rocks.&#8221;
  It always seemed to him that it was a real whisper, not his own mind  prompting him, and he walked boldly among the rocks which stretched for  a long distance along the slopes. Then, or for the time, at least, he  felt sure that a powerful hand was directing him. He saw tracks in the  soft soil between the strong uplifts and he believed that they were  fresh. Hollows were numerous there, and game of a certain kind would  seek them in bitter weather.
  His heart began to pound hard, too heavily, in fact, for his  weakened frame, and he was compelled to stop and steady himself. Then  he resumed the hunt once more, looking here and there between the rocky  uplifts and in the deep depressions. He lost the tracks and then he  found them, apparently fresher than ever. Would he take what he sought?  Was the face of Areskoui still inclining toward him? He looked up and  the bar of light was steadily growing broader and longer. The smile of  the Sun God was deeper, and his doubts went away, one by one.
  He turned toward a tall rock and a black figure sprang up, stared at  him a moment or two, and then undertook to run away. Robert's rifle  leaped to his shoulder, and, at a range so short that he could not  miss, he pulled the trigger. The animal went down, shot through the  heart, and then, silently exulting, young Lennox stood over him.
  Areskoui had, in truth, been most kind. It was a young bear, nearly  grown, very fat, and, as Robert well knew, very tender also. Here was  food, splendid food, enough to last them many days, and he rejoiced.  Then he was in a quandary. He could not carry the bear away, and while  he could cut him up, he was loath to leave any part of him there. The  wolves would soon be coming, insisting upon their share, but he was  resolved they should have none.
  He put his fingers over his mouth and blew between them a whistle,  long, shrill and piercing, a sound that penetrated farther than the  rifle shot. It was answered presently in a faint note from the opposite  slope, and, then sitting down, he waited patiently. He knew that Tayoga  and Willet would come, and, after a while, they appeared, striding  eagerly through the forest. Then Robert rose, his heart full of  gratitude and pride, and, in a grand manner, he did the honors.
  &#8220;Come, good comrades,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Come to the banquet. Have a steak  of a bear, the finest, juiciest, tenderest bear that was ever killed.  Have two steaks, three steaks, four steaks, any number of them. Here is  abundant food that Areskoui has sent us.&#8221;
  Then he reeled and would have fallen to the ground had not Willet  caught him in his arms. His great effort, made in his weakened  condition, had exhausted him and a sudden collapse came, but he revived  almost instantly, and the three together dragged the body of the bear  into the valley. Then they proceeded dextrously, but without undue  haste, to clean it, to light a fire, and to cook strips. Nor did they  eat rapidly, knowing it was not wise to do so, but took little pieces,  masticating them long and well, and allowing a decent interval between.  Their satisfaction was intense and enormous. Life, fresh and vigorous,  poured back into their veins.
  &#8220;I'm sorry our bear had to die,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;but he perished in a  good cause. I think he was reserved for the especial purpose of saving  our lives.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is so,&#8221; said Tayoga with deep conviction. &#8220;The face of Areskoui  is now turned toward us. Our unknown sin is expiated. We must cook all  the bear, and hang the flesh in the trees.&#8221;
  &#8220;So we must,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;It's not right that we three, who  are engaged in the great service of our country, should be hindered by  the danger of starvation. We ought now to be somewhere near the French  and Indians, watching them.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tomorrow we will seek them, Great Bear,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;but do you  not think that tonight we should rest?&#8221;
  &#8220;So we should, Tayoga. You're right. We'll take all chances on being  seen, keep a good fire going and enjoy our comfort.&#8221;
  &#8220;And eat a big black bear steak every hour or so,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;If we feel like it that's just what we'll do,&#8221; laughed Willet.  &#8220;It's our night, now. Surely, Robert, you're the greatest hunter in the  world! Neither Tayoga nor I saw a sign of game, but you walked straight  to your bear.&#8221;
  &#8220;No irony,&#8221; said Robert, who, nevertheless, was pleased. &#8220;It merely  proves that Areskoui had forgiven me, while he had not forgiven you  two. But don't you notice a tremendous change?&#8221;
  &#8220;Change! Change in what?&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, everything! The whole world is transformed! Around us a little  while ago stretched a scrubby, gloomy forest, but it is now magnificent  and cheerful. I never saw finer oaks and beeches. That sky which was  black and sinister has all the gorgeous golds and reds and purples of a  benevolent sunset. The wind, lately cold and wet, is actually growing  soft, dry and warm. It's a grand world, a kind world, a friendly  world!&#8221;
  &#8220;Thus, O Dagaeoga,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;does the stomach rule man and the  universe. It is empty and all is black, it is filled and all that was  black turns to rose. But the rose will soon be gone, because the  sunlight is fading and night is at hand.&#8221;
  &#8220;But it's a fine night,&#8221; said Robert sincerely. &#8220;I think it about  the finest night I ever saw coming.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have another of these beautiful broiled steaks,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;and  you'll be sure it's the finest night that ever was or ever will be.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think I will,&#8221; said Robert, as he held the steak on the end of a  sharpened stick over the coals and listened to the pleasant sizzling  sound, &#8220;and after this is finished and a respectable time has elapsed,  I may take another.&#8221;
  The revulsion in all three was tremendous. Although they had hidden  it from one another, the great decrease in physical vitality had made  their minds sink into black despair, but now that strength was  returning so fast they saw the world through different eyes. They lay  back luxuriously and their satisfaction was so intense that they  thought little of danger. Tandakora might be somewhere near, but it did  not disturb men who were as happy as they. The night came down, heavy  and dark, as had been predicted, and they smothered their fire, but  they remained before the coals, sunk in content.
  They talked for a while in low tones, but, at length, they became  silent. The big hunter considered. He knew that, despite the revulsion  in feeling, they were not yet strong enough to undertake a great  campaign against their enemies, and it would be better to remain a  while in the valley until they were restored fully.
  Beside their fire was a good enough place for the time, and Robert  kept the first watch. The night, in reality, had turned much warmer and  the sky was luminous with stars. The immense sense of comfort remained  with him, and he was not disturbed by the howling of the wolves, which  he knew had been drawn by the odor of game, but which he knew also  would be afraid to invade the camp and attack three men.
  His spirits, high as they were already, rose steadily as he watched.  Surely after the Supreme Power had cast them down into the depths, a  miracle had been worked in their behalf to take them out again. It was  no skill of his that had led him to the bear, but strength far greater  than that of man was now acting in their behalf. As they had triumphed  over starvation they would triumph over everything. His sanguine mind  predicted it.
  The next morning was crisp and cold, but not wet, and Robert ate the  most savory breakfast he could recall. That bear must have been fed on  the choicest of wild nuts, topped off with wild honey, to have been so  juicy and tender, and the thought of nuts caused him to look under the  big hickory trees, where he found many of them, large and ripe. They  made a most welcome addition to their bill of fare, taking the place of  bread. Then, they were so well pleased with themselves that they  concluded to spend another day and night in the valley.
  Tayoga about noon climbed the enclosing ridge to the north, and,  when he returned, Willet noticed a sparkle in his eyes. But the hunter  said nothing, knowing that the Onondaga would speak in his own good  time.
  &#8220;There is another valley beyond the ridge,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;and a war  party is encamped in it. They sit by their fire and eat prodigiously of  deer they have killed.&#8221;
  Robert was startled, but he kept silent, he, too, knowing that  Tayoga would tell all he intended to tell without urging.
  &#8220;They do not know we are here, I do not think they dream of our  presence,&#8221; continued the Onondaga, &#8220;Areskoui smiles on us now, and  Tododaho on his star, which we cannot see by day, is watching over us.  Their feet will not bring them this way.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you wouldn't suggest our taking to flight?&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;You  would favor hiding here in peace?&#8221;
  &#8220;Even so. It will please us some day to remember that we rested and  slept almost within hearing of our enemies, and yet they did not take  us.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's grim humor, Tayoga, but if it's the way you feel, Robert and  I are with you.&#8221;
  Later in the afternoon they saw smoke rising beyond the ridge and  they knew the warriors had built a great fire before which they were  probably lying and gorging themselves, after their fashion when they  had plenty of food, and little else to do. Yet the three remained  defiantly all that day and all through the following night. The next  morning, with ample supplies in their packs, they turned their faces  southward, and cautiously climbed the ridge in that direction, once  more passing into the region of the peaks. To their surprise they  struck several comparatively fresh trails in the passes, and they were  soon forced to the conclusion that the hostile forces were still all  about them. Near midday they stopped in a narrow gorge between high  peaks and listened to calls of the inhabitants of the forest, the faint  howls of wolves, and once or twice the yapping of a fox.
  &#8220;The warriors signaling to one another!&#8221; said Willet.
  &#8220;It is so,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;I think they have noticed our tracks in  the earth, too slight, perhaps, to tell who we are, but they will  undertake to see.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hear the call of a moose directly ahead,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;although  I know it is no moose that makes it. Our way there is cut off.&#8221;
  &#8220;And there is the howl of the wolf behind us,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;We  cannot go back.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;I suppose we must climb the mountain. It's  lucky we've got our strength again.&#8221;
  They scaled a lofty summit once more, fortunately being able to  climb among rocks, where they left no trail, and, crouched at the crest  in dense bushes, they saw two bands meet in the valley below, evidently  searching for the fugitives. There was no white man among them, but  Robert knew a gigantic figure to be that of Tandakora, seeking them  with the most intense and bitter hatred. The muzzle of his rifle began  to slide forward, but Willet put out a detaining hand.
  &#8220;No, Robert, lad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He deserves it, but his time hasn't  come yet. Besides your shot would bring the whole crowd up after us.&#8221;
  &#8220;And he belongs to me,&#8221; added Tayoga. &#8220;When he falls it is to be by  my hand.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, he belongs to you, Tayoga,&#8221; said Willet &#8220;Now they've concluded  that we continued toward the south, and they're going on that way.&#8221;
  As they felt the need of the utmost caution they spent the remainder  of the day and the next night on the crest. Robert kept the late watch,  and he saw the dawn come, red and misty, a huge sun shining over the  eastern mountains, but shedding little warmth. He was hopeful that  Tandakora and his warriors had passed on far into the south, but he  heard a distant cry rising in the clear air east of the peak and then a  reply to the west. His heart stood still for a moment. He knew that  they were the whoops of the savages and he felt that they signified a  discovery. Perhaps chance had disclosed their trail. He listened with  great intentness, but the shouts did not come again. Nevertheless the  omen was bad.
  He awoke Willet and the Onondaga, who had been sleeping soundly, and  told them what had happened, both agreeing that the shouts were charged  with import.
  &#8220;I think it likely that we will be attacked,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;Now  we must take another look at our position.&#8221;
  The peak, luckily for them, was precipitous, and its crest did not  cover an area of more than twenty or thirty square yards. On the three  sides the ascent was so steep that a man could not climb up except with  extreme difficulty, but on the fourth, by which they had come, the  slope was more gradual. The gentle climb faced the east, and it was  here that the hunter and Robert watched, while Tayoga, for the sake of  utmost precaution, kept an eye on the steep sides.
  Knowing that it was wise to economize and even to increase their  strength, they ate abundantly of the bear steaks, afterward craving  water, which they were forced to do without&#8212;the one great flaw in  their position, since the warriors might hold them there to perish of  thirst.
  Robert soon forgot the desire for water in the tenseness of watching  and waiting. But even the anxiety and the peril to his life did not  keep him from noticing the singularity of his situation, upon the  slender peak of a high mountain far in the wilderness. The sun, full of  splendor but still cold, touched with gold all the surrounding crests  and ridges and filled with a yellow but luxurious haze every gorge and  ravine. He was compelled to admire its wintry beauty, a beauty, though,  that he knew to be treacherous, surcharged as it was with savage wile  and stratagem, and a burning desire for their lives.
  A time that seemed incredible passed without demonstration from the  enemy. But he realized that it was only about two hours. He did not  expect to see any of the warriors creeping up the slopes toward them,  but too wise to watch for their faces he did expect to notice the  bushes move ever so slightly under their advance. He and Willet  remained crouched in the same positions in the shelter of high rocks.  Tayoga, who had been moving about the far side, came to them and  whispered:
  &#8220;I am going down the northern face of the cliff!&#8221;
  &#8220;Why, it's sheer insanity, Tayoga!&#8221; said the astonished hunter.
  &#8220;But I'm going.&#8221;
  &#8220;What'll you achieve after you've gone? You'll merely walk into  Tandakora's hands!&#8221;
  &#8220;I go, Great Bear, and I will return in a half hour, alive and  well.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is your mind upset, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am quite sane. Remember, Great Bear, I will be back in a half  hour unhurt.&#8221;
  Then he was gone, gliding away through the low vegetation that  covered the crest, and Robert and the hunter looked at each other.
  &#8220;There is more in this than the eye sees,&#8221; said young Lennox. &#8220;I  never knew Tayoga to speak with more confidence. I think he will be  back just as he says, in half an hour.&#8221;
  &#8220;Maybe, though I don't understand it. But there are lots of things  one doesn't understand. We must keep our eyes on the slope, and let  Tayoga solve his own problem, whatever it is.&#8221;
  There was no wind at all, but once Robert thought he saw the shrubs  halfway down the steep move, though he was not sure and nothing  followed. But, intently watching the place where the motion had  occurred, he caught a gleam of metal which he was quite sure came from  a rifle barrel.
  &#8220;Did you see it?&#8221; he whispered to the hunter.
  &#8220;Aye, lad,&#8221; replied Willet. &#8220;They're there in that dense clump,  hoping we've relaxed the watch and that they can surprise us. But it  may be two or three hours before they come any farther. Always remember  in your dealings with Indians that they have more time than anything  else, and so they know how to be patient. Now, I wonder what Tayoga is  doing! That boy certainly had something unusual on his mind!&#8221;
  &#8220;Here he is, ready to speak for himself, and back inside his  promised half hour.&#8221;
  Tayoga parted the bushes without noise, and sat down between them  behind the big rocks. He offered no explanation, but seemed very  content with himself.
  &#8220;Well, Tayoga,&#8221; said Willet, &#8220;did you go down the side of the  mountain?&#8221;
  &#8220;As far as I wished.&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you mean by that?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have been engaged in a very pleasant task, Great Bear.&#8221;
  &#8220;What pleasure can you find in scaling a steep and rocky slope?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have been drinking, Great Bear, drinking the fresh, pure water of  the mountains, and it was wonderfully cool and good to my dry throat.&#8221;
  The two gazed at him in astonishment, and he laughed low, but with  deep enjoyment.
  &#8220;I took one drink, two drinks, three drinks,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and when the  time comes I shall take more. The fountain also awaits the lips of the  Great Bear and of Dagaeoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tell it all,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;When I looked down the steep side a long time I thought I caught a  gleam as of falling water in the bushes. It was only twenty or thirty  yards below us, and, when I descended to it, I found a little fountain  bursting from a crevice in the rock. It was but a thread, making a tiny  pool a few inches across, before it dropped away among the bushes, but  it is very cool, very clear, and there is always plenty of it for many  men.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is the descent hard?&#8221; asked Willet.
  &#8220;Not for one who is strong and cautious. There are thick vines and  bushes to which to hold, and remember that the splendid water is at the  end of the journey.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then, Robert, you go,&#8221; said the hunter, &#8220;and mind, too, that you  get back soon, because my throat is parching. I'd like to have one deep  drink before the warriors attack.&#8221;
  Robert followed Tayoga, and, obeying his instructions, was soon at  the fountain, where he drank once, twice, thrice, and then once more of  the finest water he could recall. Then, deeply grateful for the  Onondaga's observation, he climbed back, and the hunter took his turn.
  &#8220;It was certainly good, Tayoga,&#8221; he said, when he was back in  position. &#8220;Some men don't think much of water, but none of us can live  without it. You've saved our lives.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps, O Great Bear,&#8221; responded the Onondaga, &#8220;but if the bushes  below continue to shake as they are doing we shall have to save them  again. Ah!&#8221;
  The exclamation, long drawn but low, was followed by the leap of his  rifle to the shoulder, and the pressing of his finger on the trigger. A  stream of fire sprang from the muzzle of the long barrel to be followed  by a yell in one of the thickets clustering on the slope. A savage rose  to his feet, threw up his arms and fell headlong, his body crashing far  below on the rocks. Robert shut his eyes and shivered.
  &#8220;He was dead before he touched earth, lad,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;Now  the others are ready to scramble back. Look how the bushes are shaking  again!&#8221;
  Robert had shut his eyes only for a moment, and now he saw the scrub  shaking more violently than ever. Then he had a fleeting glimpse of  brown bodies as all the warriors descended rapidly. Anyone of the three  might have fired with good aim, but they did not raise their rifles.  Since their enemies were retreating they would let them retreat.
  &#8220;They're all back in the valley now,&#8221; said the hunter after a little  while, &#8220;and they'll think a lot before they try the steep ascent a  second time. Now it's a question of patience, and they hope we'll  become so weak from thirst that we'll fall into their hands.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tandakora and his warriors would be consumed with anger if they  knew of our spring,&#8221; said Tayoga.
  &#8220;They'll find out about it soon,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;I think not,&#8221; said Tayoga. &#8220;I noticed when I was at the fountain  that the rivulet ran back into the cliff about a hundred feet below,  and one can see the water only from the crest. If Areskoui has allowed  us to be besieged here, he at least has created much in our favor.&#8221;
  He looked toward the east, where the great red sun was shining, and  worshiped silently. It seemed to Robert that his young comrade stared  unwinking for a long time into the eye of the Sun God, though perhaps  it was only a few seconds. But his form expanded and his face was  illumined. Robert knew that the Onondaga's confidence had become  supreme, and he shared in it.
  The hunter and Tayoga kept the watch after a while, and young Lennox  was free to wander about the crest as he wished. He examined carefully  the three sides they had left unguarded, but was convinced that no  warrior, no matter how skillful and tenacious, could climb up there.  Then he wandered back toward the sentinels, and, sitting down under a  tree, began to study the distant slopes across the gorge.
  He saw the warriors gather by-and-by in a deep recess out of rifle  shot, light a fire and begin to cook great quantities of game, as if  they meant to stay there and keep the siege until doomsday, if  necessary. He saw the gigantic figure of Tandakora approach the fire,  eat voraciously for a while and then go away. After him came a white  man in French uniform. He thought at first it was St. Luc and his heart  beat hard, but he was able to discern presently that it was an officer  not much older than himself, in a uniform of white faced with violet  and a black, three-cornered hat. Finally he recognized young De  Galissonniere, whom he had met in Quebec, and whom he had seen a few  days since in the French camp.
  As he looked De Galissonniere left the recess, descended into the  valley and then began to climb their slope, a white handkerchief held  aloft on the point of his small sword. Young Lennox immediately joined  the two watchers at the brink.
  &#8220;A flag of truce! Now what can he want!&#8221; he exclaimed.
  &#8220;We'll soon see,&#8221; replied Willet. &#8220;He's within good hearing now, and  I'll hail him.&#8221;
  He shouted in powerful tones that echoed in the gorge:
  &#8220;Below there! What is it?&#8221;
  &#8220;I have something to say that will be of great importance to you,&#8221;  replied De Galissonniere.
  &#8220;Then come forward, while we remain here. We don't trust your  allies.&#8221;
  Robert saw the face of the young Frenchman flush, but De  Galissonniere, as if knowing the truth, and resolved not to quibble  over it, climbed steadily. When he was within twenty feet of the crest  the hunter called to him to halt, and he did so, leaning easily against  a strong bush, while the three waited eagerly to hear what he had to  say.
