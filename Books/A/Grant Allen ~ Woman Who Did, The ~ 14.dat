It was a changed London to which Herminia returned. She was  homeless, penniless, friendless. Above all she was declassee.  The world that had known her now knew her no more. Women who had  smothered her with their Judas kisses passed her by in their  victorias with a stony stare. Even men pretended to be looking the  other way, or crossed the street to avoid the necessity for  recognizing her. "So awkward to be mixed up with such a scandal!"  She hardly knew as yet herself how much her world was changed  indeed; for had she not come back to it, the mother of an  illegitimate daughter? But she began to suspect it the very first  day when she arrived at Charing Cross, clad in a plain black dress,  with her baby at her bosom. Her first task was to find rooms; her  next to find a livelihood. Even the first involved no small  relapse from the purity of her principles. After long hours of  vain hunting, she found at last she could only get lodgings for  herself and Alan's child by telling a virtual lie, against which  her soul revolted. She was forced to describe herself as Mrs.  Barton; she must allow her landlady to suppose she was really a  widow. Woe unto you, scribes and hypocrites! in all Christian  London <i>Miss</i> Barton and her baby could never have found a  "respectable" room in which to lay their heads. So she yielded to  the inevitable, and took two tiny attics in a small street off the  Edgware Road at a moderate rental. To live alone in a cottage as  of yore would have been impossible now she had a baby of her own to  tend, besides earning her livelihood; she fell back regretfully on  the lesser evil of lodgings.    
To earn her livelihood was a hard task, though Herminia's  indomitable energy rode down all obstacles. Teaching, of course,  was now quite out of the question; no English parent could intrust  the education of his daughters to the hands of a woman who has  dared and suffered much, for conscience' sake, in the cause of  freedom for herself and her sisters. But even before Herminia  went away to Perugia, she had acquired some small journalistic  connection; and now, in her hour of need, she found not a few of  the journalistic leaders by no means unwilling to sympathize and  fraternize with her. To be sure, they didn't ask the free woman to  their homes, nor invite her to meet their own women:--even an  enlightened journalist must draw a line somewhere in the matter of  society; but they understood and appreciated the sincerity of her  motives, and did what they could to find employment and salary for  her. Herminia was an honest and conscientious worker; she knew  much about many things; and nature had gifted her with the  instinctive power of writing clearly and unaffectedly the English  language. So she got on with editors. Who could resist, indeed,  the pathetic charm of that girlish figure, simply clad in  unobtrusive black, and sanctified in every feature of the shrinking  face by the beauty of sorrow? Not the men who stand at the head of  the one English profession which more than all others has escaped  the leprous taint of that national moral blight that calls itself  "respectability."    
In a slow and tentative way, then, Herminia crept back into  unrecognized recognition. It was all she needed. Companionship  she liked; she hated society. That mart was odious to her where  women barter their bodies for a title, a carriage, a place at the  head of some rich man's table. Bohemia sufficed her. Her terrible  widowhood, too, was rendered less terrible to her by the care of  her little one. Babbling lips, pattering feet, made heaven in her  attic. Every good woman is by nature a mother, and finds best in  maternity her social and moral salvation. She shall be saved in  child-bearing. Herminia was far removed indeed from that blatant  and decadent sect of "advanced women" who talk as though motherhood  were a disgrace and a burden, instead of being, as it is, the full  realization of woman's faculties, the natural outlet for woman's  wealth of emotion. She knew that to be a mother is the best  privilege of her sex, a privilege of which unholy manmade  institutions now conspire to deprive half the finest and noblest  women in our civilized communities. Widowed as she was, she still  pitied the unhappy beings doomed to the cramped life and dwarfed  heart of the old maid; pitied them as sincerely as she despised  those unhealthy souls who would make of celibacy, wedded or  unwedded, a sort of anti-natural religion for women. Alan's death,  however, had left Herminia's ship rudderless. Her mission had  failed. That she acknowledged herself. She lived now for Dolores.  The child to whom she had given the noble birthright of liberty was  destined from her cradle to the apostolate of women. Alone of her  sex, she would start in life emancipated. While others must say,  "With a great sum obtained I this freedom," Dolores could answer  with Paul, "But I was free born." That was no mean heritage.    
Gradually Herminia got work to her mind; work enough to support her  in the modest way that sufficed her small wants for herself and her  baby. In London, given time enough, you can live down anything,  perhaps even the unspeakable sin of having struck a righteous blow  in the interest of women. And day by day, as months and years went  on, Herminia felt she was living down the disgrace of having obeyed  an enlightened conscience. She even found friends. Dear old Miss  Smith-Waters used to creep round by night, like Nicodemus--  respectability would not have allowed her to perform that Christian  act in open daylight,--and sit for an hour or two with her dear  misguided Herminia. Miss Smith-Waters prayed nightly for  Herminia's "conversion," yet not without an uncomfortable  suspicion, after all, that Herminia had very little indeed to be  "converted" from. Other people also got to know her by degrees; an  editor's wife; a kind literary hostess; some socialistic ladies who  liked to be "advanced;" a friendly family or two of the Bohemian  literary or artistic pattern. Among them Herminia learned to be as  happy in time as she could ever again be, now she had lost her  Alan. She was Mrs. Barton to them all; that lie she found it  practically impossible to fight against. Even the Bohemians  refused to let their children ask after Miss Barton's baby.    
So wrapt in vile falsehoods and conventions are we. So far have we  travelled from the pristine realities of truth and purity. We lie  to our children--in the interests of morality.    
After a time, in the intervals between doing her journalistic work  and nursing Alan's baby, Herminia found leisure to write a novel.  It was seriously meant, of course, but still it was a novel. That  is every woman's native idea of literature. It reflects the  relatively larger part which the social life plays in the existence  of women. If a man tells you he wants to write a book, nine times  out of ten he means a treatise or argument on some subject that  interests him. Even the men who take in the end to writing novels  have generally begun with other aims and other aspirations, and  have only fallen back upon the art of fiction in the last resort as  a means of livelihood. But when a woman tells you she wants to  write a book, nine times out of ten she means she wants to write a  novel. For that task nature has most often endowed her richly.  Her quicker intuitions, her keener interest in social life, her  deeper insight into the passing play of emotions and of motives,  enable her to paint well the complex interrelations of every-day  existence. So Herminia, like the rest, wrote her own pet novel.    
By the time her baby was eighteen months old, she had finished it.  It was blankly pessimistic, of course. Blank pessimism is the one  creed possible for all save fools. To hold any other is to curl  yourself up selfishly in your own easy chair, and say to your soul,  "O soul, eat and drink; O soul, make merry. Carouse thy fill.  Ignore the maimed lives, the stricken heads and seared hearts,  the reddened fangs and ravening claws of nature all round thee."  Pessimism is sympathy. Optimism is selfishness. The optimist  folds his smug hands on his ample knees, and murmurs contentedly,  "The Lord has willed it;" "There must always be rich and poor;"  "Nature has, after all, her great law of compensation." The  pessimist knows well self-deception like that is either a fraud or  a blind, and recognizing the seething mass of misery at his doors  gives what he can,--his pity, or, where possible, his faint aid, in  redressing the crying inequalities and injustices of man or nature.    
All honest art is therefore of necessity pessimistic. Herminia's  romance was something more than that. It was the despairing  heart-cry of a soul in revolt. It embodied the experiences and  beliefs and sentiments of a martyred woman. It enclosed a lofty  ethical purpose. She wrote it with fiery energy, for her baby's  sake, on waste scraps of paper, at stray moments snatched from  endless other engagements. And as soon as it was finished, she sent  it in fear and trembling to a publisher.    
She had chosen her man well. He was a thinker himself, and he  sympathized with thinkers. Though doubtful as to the venture, he  took all the risk himself with that generosity one so often sees in  the best-abused of professions. In three or four weeks' time "A  Woman's World" came out, and Herminia waited in breathless anxiety  for the verdict of the reviewers.    
For nearly a month she waited in vain. Then, one Friday, as she  was returning by underground railway from the Strand to Edgeware  Road, with Dolores in her arms, her eye fell as she passed upon the  display-bill of the "Spectator." Sixpence was a great deal of  money to Herminia; but bang it went recklessly when she saw among  the contents an article headed, "A Very Advanced Woman's Novel."  She felt sure it must be hers, and she was not mistaken.  Breathlessly she ran over that first estimate of her work.  It was with no little elation that she laid down the number.    
Not that the critique was by any means at all favorable. How could  Herminia expect it in such a quarter? But the "Spectator" is at  least conspicuously fair, though it remains in other ways an  interesting and ivy-clad mediaeval relic. "Let us begin by  admitting," said the Spectatorial scribe, "that Miss Montague's  book" (she had published it under a pseudonym) "is a work of  genius. Much as we dislike its whole tone, and still more its  conclusions, the gleam of pure genius shines forth undeniable on  every page of it. Whoever takes it up must read on against his  will till he has finished the last line of this terrible tragedy; a  hateful fascination seems to hold and compel him. Its very purity  makes it dangerous. The book is mistaken; the book is poisonous;  the book is morbid; the book is calculated to do irremediable  mischief; but in spite of all that, the book is a book of  undeniable and sadly misplaced genius."    
If he had said no more, Herminia would have been amply satisfied.  To be called morbid by the "Spectator" is a sufficient proof that  you have hit at least the right tack in morals. And to be accused  of genius as well was indeed a triumph. No wonder Herminia went  home to her lonely attic that night justifiably elated. She  fancied after this her book must make a hit. It might be blamed  and reviled, but at any rate it was now safe from the ignominy of  oblivion.    
Alas, how little she knew of the mysteries of the book-market! As  little as all the rest of us. Day after day, from that afternoon  forth, she watched in vain for succeeding notices. Not a single  other paper in England reviewed her. At the libraries, her romance  was never so much as asked for. And the reason for these phenomena  is not far to seek by those who know the ways of the British public.  For her novel was earnestly and sincerely written; it breathed a  moral air, therefore it was voted dull; therefore nobody cared for  it. The "Spectator" had noticed it because of its manifest  earnestness and sincerity; for though the "Spectator" is always on  the side of the lie and the wrong, it is earnest and sincere, and  has a genuine sympathy for earnestness and sincerity, even on the  side of truth and righteousness. Nobody else even looked at it.  People said to themselves, "This book seems to be a book with a  teaching not thoroughly banal, like the novels-with-a-purpose after  which we flock; so we'll give it a wide berth."    
And they shunned it accordingly.    
That was the end of Herminia Barton's literary aspirations. She  had given the people of her best, and the people rejected it. Now  she gave them of her most mediocre; the nearest to their own level  of thought and feeling to which her hand could reduce itself. And  the people accepted it. The rest of her life was hack-work; by  that, she could at least earn a living for Dolores. Her "Antigone,  for the Use of Ladies' Schools" still holds its own at Girton and  Somerville.
