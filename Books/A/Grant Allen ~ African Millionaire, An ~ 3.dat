Like most South Africans, Sir Charles Vandrift is anything but  sedentary. He hates sitting down. He must always "trek." He cannot  live without moving about freely. Six weeks in Mayfair at a time is  as much as he can stand. Then he must run away incontinently for  rest and change to Scotland, Homburg, Monte Carlo, Biarritz. "I  won't be a limpet on the rock," he says. Thus it came to pass that  in the early autumn we found ourselves stopping at the Metropole  at Brighton. We were the accustomed nice little family party--Sir  Charles and Amelia, myself and Isabel, with the suite as usual.    
On the first Sunday morning after our arrival we strolled out,  Charles and I--I regret to say during the hours allotted for Divine  service--on to the King's Road, to get a whiff of fresh air, and a  glimpse of the waves that were churning the Channel. The two ladies  (with their bonnets) had gone to church; but Sir Charles had risen  late, fatigued from the week's toil, while I myself was suffering  from a matutinal headache, which I attributed to the close air in  the billiard-room overnight, combined, perhaps, with the insidious  effect of a brand of soda-water to which I was little accustomed; I  had used it to dilute my evening whisky. We were to meet our wives  afterwards at the church parade--an institution to which I believe  both Amelia and Isabel attach even greater importance than to the  sermon which precedes it.    
We sat down on a glass seat. Charles gazed inquiringly up and down  the King's Road, on the look-out for a boy with Sunday papers.  At last one passed. "Observer," my brother-in-law called out  laconically.    
"Ain't got none," the boy answered, brandishing his bundle in our  faces. "'Ave a Referee or a Pink 'Un?"    
Charles, however, is not a Refereader, while as to the Pink 'Un, he  considers it unsuitable for public perusal on Sunday morning. It may  be read indoors, but in the open air its blush betrays it. So he  shook his head, and muttered, "If you pass an Observer, send him on  here at once to me."    
A polite stranger who sat close to us turned round with a pleasant  smile. "Would you allow me to offer you one?" he said, drawing a  copy from his pocket. "I fancy I bought the last. There's a run  on them to-day, you see. Important news this morning from the  Transvaal."    
Charles raised his eyebrows, and accepted it, as I thought, just a  trifle grumpily. So, to remove the false impression his surliness  might produce on so benevolent a mind, I entered into conversation  with the polite stranger. He was a man of middle age, and medium  height, with a cultivated air, and a pair of gold pince-nez; his  eyes were sharp; his voice was refined; he dropped into talk before  long about distinguished people just then in Brighton. It was clear  at once that he was hand in glove with many of the very best kind.  We compared notes as to Nice, Rome, Florence, Cairo. Our new  acquaintance had scores of friends in common with us, it seemed;  indeed, our circles so largely coincided, that I wondered we had  never happened till then to knock up against one another.    
"And Sir Charles Vandrift, the great African millionaire," he said  at last, "do you know anything of <i>him</i>? I'm told he's at present  down here at the Metropole."    
I waved my hand towards the person in question.    
"<i>This</i> is Sir Charles Vandrift," I answered, with proprietary pride;  "and <i>I</i> am his brother-in-law, Mr. Seymour Wentworth."    
"Oh, indeed!" the stranger answered, with a curious air of drawing  in his horns. I wondered whether he had just been going to pretend  he knew Sir Charles, or whether perchance he was on the point of  saying something highly uncomplimentary, and was glad to have  escaped it.    
By this time, however, Charles laid down the paper and chimed into  our conversation. I could see at once from his mollified tone that  the news from the Transvaal was favourable to his operations in  Cloetedorp Golcondas. He was therefore in a friendly and affable  temper. His whole manner changed at once. He grew polite in return  to the polite stranger. Besides, we knew the man moved in the best  society; he had acquaintances whom Amelia was most anxious to secure  for her "At Homes" in Mayfair--young Faith, the novelist, and Sir  Richard Montrose, the great Arctic traveller. As for the painters,  it was clear that he was sworn friends with the whole lot of them.  He dined with Academicians, and gave weekly breakfasts to the  members of the Institute. Now, Amelia is particularly desirous  that her salon should not be considered too exclusively financial  and political in character: with a solid basis of M.P.'s and  millionaires, she loves a delicate under-current of literature,  art, and the musical glasses. Our new acquaintance was extremely  communicative: "Knows his place in society, Sey," Sir Charles said  to me afterwards, "and is therefore not afraid of talking freely,  as so many people are who have doubts about their position." We  exchanged cards before we rose. Our new friend's name turned out  to be Dr. Edward Polperro.    
"In practice here?" I inquired, though his garb belied it.    
"Oh, not medical," he answered. "I am an LL.D. don't you know. I  interest myself in art, and buy to some extent for the National  Gallery."    
The very man for Amelia's "At Homes"! Sir Charles snapped at him  instantly. "I've brought my four-in-hand down here with me," he  said, in his best friendly manner, "and we think of tooling over  to-morrow to Lewes. If you'd care to take a seat I'm sure Lady  Vandrift would be charmed to see you."    
"You're very kind," the Doctor said, "on so casual an introduction.  I'm sure I shall be delighted."    
"We start from the Metropole at ten-thirty," Charles went on.    
"I shall be there. Good morning!" And, with a satisfied smile, he  rose and left us, nodding.    
We returned to the lawn, to Amelia and Isabel. Our new friend passed  us once or twice. Charles stopped him and introduced him. He was  walking with two ladies, most elegantly dressed in rather peculiar  artistic dresses. Amelia was taken at first sight by his manner.  "One could see at a glance," she said, "he was a person of culture  and of real distinction. I wonder whether he could bring the P.R.A.  to my Parliamentary 'At Home' on Wednesday fortnight?"    
Next day, at ten-thirty, we started on our drive. Our team has been  considered the best in Sussex. Charles is an excellent, though  somewhat anxious--or, might I say better, somewhat careful?--whip.  He finds the management of two leaders and two wheelers fills his  hands for the moment, both literally and figuratively, leaving very  little time for general conversation. Lady Belleisle of Beacon  bloomed beside him on the box (her bloom is perennial, and applied  by her maid); Dr. Polperro occupied the seat just behind with myself  and Amelia. The Doctor talked most of the time to Lady Vandrift: his  discourse was of picture-galleries, which Amelia detests, but in  which she thinks it incumbent upon her, as Sir Charles's wife, to  affect now and then a cultivated interest. Noblesse oblige; and the  walls of Castle Seldon, our place in Ross-shire, are almost covered  now with Leaders and with Orchardsons. This result was first arrived  at by a singular accident. Sir Charles wanted a leader--for his  coach, you understand--and told an artistic friend so. The artistic  friend brought him a Leader next week with a capital L; and Sir  Charles was so taken aback that he felt ashamed to confess the  error. So he was turned unawares into a patron of painting.    
Dr. Polperro, in spite of his too pronouncedly artistic talk, proved  on closer view a most agreeable companion. He diversified his art  cleverly with anecdotes and scandals; he told us exactly which  famous painters had married their cooks, and which had only married  their models; and otherwise showed himself a most diverting talker.  Among other things, however, he happened to mention once that he  had recently discovered a genuine Rembrandt--a quite undoubted  Rembrandt, which had remained for years in the keeping of a  certain obscure Dutch family. It had always been allowed to be a  masterpiece of the painter, but it had seldom been seen for the  last half-century save by a few intimate acquaintances. It was a  portrait of one Maria Vanrenen of Haarlem, and he had bought it  of her descendants at Gouda, in Holland.    
I saw Charles prick up his ears, though he took no open notice.  This Maria Vanrenen, as it happened, was a remote collateral  ancestress of the Vandrifts, before they emigrated to the Cape in  1780; and the existence of the portrait, though not its whereabouts,  was well known in the family. Isabel had often mentioned it. If it  was to be had at anything like a reasonable price, it would be a  splendid thing for the boys (Sir Charles, I ought to say, has two  sons at Eton) to possess an undoubted portrait of an ancestress  by Rembrandt.    
Dr. Polperro talked a good deal after that about this valuable find.  He had tried to sell it at first to the National Gallery; but  though the Directors admired the work immensely, and admitted its  genuineness, they regretted that the funds at their disposal this  year did not permit them to acquire so important a canvas at a  proper figure. South Kensington again was too poor; but the Doctor  was in treaty at present with the Louvre and with Berlin. Still,  it was a pity a fine work of art like that, once brought into the  country, should be allowed to go out of it. Some patriotic patron  of the fine arts ought to buy it for his own house, or else  munificently present it to the nation.    
All the time Charles said nothing. But I could feel him cogitating.  He even looked behind him once, near a difficult corner (while the  guard was actually engaged in tootling his horn to let passers-by  know that the coach was coming), and gave Amelia a warning glance  to say nothing committing, which had at once the requisite effect  of sealing her mouth for the moment. It is a very unusual thing  for Charles to look back while driving. I gathered from his doing  so that he was inordinately anxious to possess this Rembrandt.    
When we arrived at Lewes we put up our horses at the inn,  and Charles ordered a lunch on his wonted scale of princely  magnificence. Meanwhile we wandered, two and two, about the town  and castle. I annexed Lady Belleisle, who is at least amusing.  Charles drew me aside before starting. "Look here, Sey," he  said, "we must be <i>very</i> careful. This man, Polperro, is a chance  acquaintance. There's nothing an astute rogue can take one in over  more easily than an Old Master. If the Rembrandt is genuine I  ought to have it; if it really represents Maria Vanrenen, it's a  duty I owe to the boys to buy it. But I've been done twice lately,  and I won't be done a third time. We must go to work cautiously."    
"You are right," I answered. "No more seers and curates!"    
"If this man's an impostor," Charles went on--"and in spite of what  he says about the National Gallery and so forth, we know nothing of  him--the story he tells is just the sort of one such a fellow would  trump up in a moment to deceive me. He could easily learn who I  was--I'm a well-known figure; he knew I was in Brighton, and he  may have been sitting on that glass seat on Sunday on purpose to  entrap me."    
"He introduced your name," I said, "and the moment he found out who  I was he plunged into talk with me."    
"Yes," Charles continued. "He may have learned about the portrait  of Maria Vanrenen, which my grandmother always said was preserved  at Gouda; and, indeed, I myself have often mentioned it, as you  doubtless remember. If so, what more natural, say, for a rogue than  to begin talking about the portrait in that innocent way to Amelia?  If he wants a Rembrandt, I believe they can be turned out to order  to any amount in Birmingham. The moral of all which is, it behoves  us to be careful."    
"Right you are," I answered; "and I am keeping my eye upon him."    
We drove back by another road, overshadowed by beech-trees in  autumnal gold. It was a delightful excursion. Dr. Polperro's heart  was elated by lunch and the excellent dry Monopole. He talked  amazingly. I never heard a man with a greater or more varied flow  of anecdote. He had been everywhere and knew all about everybody.  Amelia booked him at once for her "At Home" on Wednesday week,  and he promised to introduce her to several artistic and literary  celebrities.    
That evening, however, about half-past seven, Charles and I strolled  out together on the King's Road for a blow before dinner. We dine at  eight. The air was delicious. We passed a small new hotel, very  smart and exclusive, with a big bow window. There, in evening dress,  lights burning and blind up, sat our friend, Dr. Polperro, with a  lady facing him, young, graceful, and pretty. A bottle of champagne  stood open before him. He was helping himself plentifully to  hot-house grapes, and full of good humour. It was clear he and the  lady were occupied in the intense enjoyment of some capital joke;  for they looked queerly at one another, and burst now and again  into merry peals of laughter.    
I drew back. So did Sir Charles. One idea passed at once through  both our minds. I murmured, "Colonel Clay!" He answered, "<i>and</i>  Madame Picardet!"    
They were not in the least like the Reverend Richard and Mrs.  Brabazon. But that clinched the matter. Nor did I see a sign of the  aquiline nose of the Mexican Seer. Still, I had learnt by then to  discount appearances. If these were indeed the famous sharper and  his wife or accomplice, we must be very careful. We were forewarned  this time. Supposing he had the audacity to try a third trick of  the sort upon us we had him under our thumbs. Only, we must take  steps to prevent his dexterously slipping through our fingers.    
"He can wriggle like an eel," said the Commissary at Nice. We both  recalled those words, and laid our plans deep to prevent the man's  wriggling away from us on this third occasion.    
"I tell you what it is, Sey," my brother-in-law said, with  impressive slowness. "This time we must deliberately lay ourselves  out to be swindled. We must propose of our own accord to buy the  picture, making him guarantee it in writing as a genuine Rembrandt,  and taking care to tie him down by most stringent conditions. But  we must seem at the same time to be unsuspicious and innocent as  babes; we must swallow whole whatever lies he tells us; pay his  price--nominally--by cheque for the portrait; and then, arrest him  the moment the bargain is complete, with the proofs of his guilt  then and there upon him. Of course, what he'll try to do will be to  vanish into thin air at once, as he did at Nice and Paris; but, this  time, we'll have the police in waiting and everything ready. We'll  avoid precipitancy, but we'll avoid delay too. We must hold our  hands off till he's actually accepted and pocketed the money; and  then, we must nab him instantly, and walk him off to the local Bow  Street. That's my plan of campaign. Meanwhile, we should appear  all trustful innocence and confiding guilelessness."    
In pursuance of this well-laid scheme, we called next day on Dr.  Polperro at his hotel, and were introduced to his wife, a dainty  little woman, in whom we affected not to recognise that arch Madame  Picardet or that simple White Heather. The Doctor talked charmingly  (as usual) about art--what a well-informed rascal he was, to be  sure!--and Sir Charles expressed some interest in the supposed  Rembrandt. Our new friend was delighted; we could see by his  well-suppressed eagerness of tone that he knew us at once for  probable purchasers. He would run up to town next day, he said, and  bring down the portrait. And in effect, when Charles and I took our  wonted places in the Pullman next morning, on our way up to the  half-yearly meeting of Cloetedorp Golcondas, there was our Doctor,  leaning back in his arm-chair as if the car belonged to him. Charles  gave me an expressive look. "Does it in style," he whispered,  "doesn't he? Takes it out of my five thousand; or discounts the  amount he means to chouse me of with his spurious Rembrandt."    
Arrived in town, we went to work at once. We set a private detective  from Marvillier's to watch our friend; and from him we learned that  the so-called Doctor dropped in for a picture that day at a dealer's  in the West-end (I suppress the name, having a judicious fear of  the law of libel ever before my eyes), a dealer who was known to be  mixed up before then in several shady or disreputable transactions.  Though, to be sure, my experience has been that picture dealers  are--picture dealers. Horses rank first in my mind as begetters and  producers of unscrupulous agents, but pictures run them a very good  second. Anyhow, we found out that our distinguished art-critic  picked up his Rembrandt at this dealer's shop, and came down with  it in his care the same night to Brighton.    
In order not to act precipitately, and so ruin our plans, we induced  Dr. Polperro (what a cleverly chosen name!) to bring the Rembrandt  round to the Metropole for our inspection, and to leave it with us  while we got the opinion of an expert from London.    
The expert came down, and gave us a full report upon the alleged  Old Master. In his judgment, it was not a Rembrandt at all, but  a cunningly-painted and well-begrimed modern Dutch imitation.  Moreover, he showed us by documentary evidence that the real  portrait of Maria Vanrenen had, as a matter of fact, been brought  to England five years before, and sold to Sir J. H. Tomlinson, the  well-known connoisseur, for eight thousand pounds. Dr. Polperro's  picture was, therefore, at best either a replica by Rembrandt; or  else, more probably, a copy by a pupil; or, most likely of all,  a mere modern forgery.    
We were thus well prepared to fasten our charge of criminal  conspiracy upon the self-styled Doctor. But in order to make  assurance still more certain, we threw out vague hints to him that  the portrait of Maria Vanrenen might really be elsewhere, and even  suggested in his hearing that it might not improbably have got into  the hands of that omnivorous collector, Sir J. H. Tomlinson. But  the vendor was proof against all such attempts to decry his goods.  He had the effrontery to brush away the documentary evidence, and to  declare that Sir J. H. Tomlinson (one of the most learned and astute  picture-buyers in England) had been smartly imposed upon by a needy  Dutch artist with a talent for forgery. The real Maria Vanrenen, he  declared and swore, was the one he offered us. "Success has turned  the man's head," Charles said to me, well pleased. "He thinks we  will swallow any obvious lie he chooses to palm off upon us. But the  bucket has come once too often to the well. This time we checkmate  him." It was a mixed metaphor, I admit; but Sir Charles's tropes  are not always entirely superior to criticism.    
So we pretended to believe our man, and accepted his assurances.  Next came the question of price. This was warmly debated, for form's  sake only. Sir J. H. Tomlinson had paid eight thousand for his  genuine Maria. The Doctor demanded ten thousand for his spurious  one. There was really no reason why we should higgle and dispute,  for Charles meant merely to give his cheque for the sum and then  arrest the fellow; but, still, we thought it best for the avoidance  of suspicion to make a show of resistance; and we at last beat him  down to nine thousand guineas. For this amount he was to give us a  written warranty that the work he sold us was a genuine Rembrandt,  that it represented Maria Vanrenen of Haarlem, and that he had  bought it direct, without doubt or question, from that good lady's  descendants at Gouda, in Holland.    
It was capitally done. We arranged the thing to perfection. We had a  constable in waiting in our rooms at the Metropole, and we settled  that Dr. Polperro was to call at the hotel at a certain fixed hour  to sign the warranty and receive his money. A regular agreement on  sound stamped paper was drawn out between us. At the appointed time  the "party of the first part" came, having already given us over  possession of the portrait. Charles drew a cheque for the amount  agreed upon, and signed it. Then he handed it to the Doctor.  Polperro just clutched at it. Meanwhile, I took up my post by  the door, while two men in plain clothes, detectives from the  police-station, stood as men-servants and watched the windows. We  feared lest the impostor, once he had got the cheque, should dodge  us somehow, as he had already done at Nice and in Paris. The moment  he had pocketed his money with a smile of triumph, I advanced to him  rapidly. I had in my possession a pair of handcuffs. Before he knew  what was happening, I had slipped them on his wrists and secured  them dexterously, while the constable stepped forward. "We have got  you this time!" I cried. "We know who you are, Dr. Polperro. You  are--Colonel Clay, alias Senor Antonio Herrera, alias the Reverend  Richard Peploe Brabazon."    
I never saw any man so astonished in my life! He was utterly  flabbergasted. Charles thought he must have expected to get clear  away at once, and that this prompt action on our part had taken  the fellow so much by surprise as to simply unman him. He gazed  about him as if he hardly realised what was happening.    
"Are these two raving maniacs?" he asked at last, "or what do they  mean by this nonsensical gibberish about Antonio Herrera?"    
The constable laid his hand on the prisoner's shoulder.    
"It's all right, my man," he said. "We've got warrants out against  you. I arrest you, Edward Polperro, alias the Reverend Richard  Peploe Brabazon, on a charge of obtaining money under false  pretences from Sir Charles Vandrift, K.C.M.G., M.P., on his sworn  information, now here subscribed to." For Charles had had the  thing drawn out in readiness beforehand.    
Our prisoner drew himself up. "Look here, officer," he said, in an  offended tone, "there's some mistake here in this matter. I have  never given an alias at any time in my life. How do you know this  is really Sir Charles Vandrift? It may be a case of bullying  personation. My belief is, though, they're a pair of escaped  lunatics."    
"We'll see about that to-morrow," the constable said, collaring him.  "At present you've got to go off with me quietly to the station,  where these gentlemen will enter up the charge against you."    
They carried him off, protesting. Charles and I signed the  charge-sheet; and the officer locked him up to await his examination  next day before the magistrate.    
We were half afraid even now the fellow would manage somehow to  get out on bail and give us the slip in spite of everything;  and, indeed, he protested in the most violent manner against the  treatment to which we were subjecting "a gentleman in his position."  But Charles took care to tell the police it was all right; that he  was a dangerous and peculiarly slippery criminal, and that on no  account must they let him go on any pretext whatever, till he had  been properly examined before the magistrates.    
We learned at the hotel that night, curiously enough, that there  really <i>was</i> a Dr. Polperro, a distinguished art critic, whose  name, we didn't doubt, our impostor had been assuming.    
Next morning, when we reached the court, an inspector met us with a  very long face. "Look here, gentlemen," he said, "I'm afraid you've  committed a very serious blunder. You've made a precious bad mess of  it. You've got yourselves into a scrape; and, what's worse, you've  got us into one also. You were a deal too smart with your sworn  information. We've made inquiries about this gentleman, and we find  the account he gives of himself is perfectly correct. His name <i>is</i>  Polperro; he's a well-known art critic and collector of pictures,  employed abroad by the National Gallery. He was formerly an official  in the South Kensington Museum, and he's a C.B. and LL.D., very  highly respected. You've made a sad mistake, that's where it is; and  you'll probably have to answer a charge of false imprisonment, in  which I'm afraid you have also involved our own department."    
Charles gasped with horror. "You haven't let him out," he cried, "on  those absurd representations? You haven't let him slip through your  hands as you did that murderer fellow?"    
"Let him slip through our hands?" the inspector cried. "I only wish  he would. There's no chance of that, unfortunately. He's in the  court there, this moment, breathing out fire and slaughter against  you both; and we're here to protect you if he should happen to fall  upon you. He's been locked up all night on your mistaken affidavits,  and, naturally enough, he's mad with anger."    
"If you haven't let him go, I'm satisfied," Charles answered.  "He's a fox for cunning. Where is he? Let me see him."    
We went into the court. There we saw our prisoner conversing  amicably, in the most excited way, with the magistrate (who, it  seems, was a personal friend of his); and Charles at once went  up and spoke to them. Dr. Polperro turned round and glared at him  through his pince-nez.    
"The only possible explanation of this person's extraordinary and  incredible conduct," he said, "is, that he must be mad--and his  secretary equally so. He made my acquaintance, unasked, on a glass  seat on the King's Road; invited me to go on his coach to Lewes;  volunteered to buy a valuable picture of me; and then, at the  last moment, unaccountably gave me in charge on this silly and  preposterous trumped-up accusation. I demand a summons for false  imprisonment."    
Suddenly it began to dawn upon us that the tables were turned. By  degrees it came out that we had made a mistake. Dr. Polperro was  really the person he represented himself to be, and had been always.  His picture, we found out, was the real Maria Vanrenen, and a  genuine Rembrandt, which he had merely deposited for cleaning and  restoring at the suspicious dealer's. Sir J. H. Tomlinson had been  imposed upon and cheated by a cunning Dutchman; <i>his</i> picture, though  also an undoubted Rembrandt, was <i>not</i> the Maria, and was an inferior  specimen in bad preservation. The authority we had consulted turned  out to be an ignorant, self-sufficient quack. The Maria, moreover,  was valued by other experts at no more than five or six thousand  guineas. Charles wanted to cry off his bargain, but Dr. Polperro  naturally wouldn't hear of it. The agreement was a legally binding  instrument, and what passed in Charles's mind at the moment had  nothing to do with the written contract. Our adversary only  consented to forego the action for false imprisonment on condition  that Charles inserted a printed apology in the Times, and paid him  five hundred pounds compensation for damage to character. So that  was the end of our well-planned attempt to arrest the swindler.    
Not quite the end, however; for, of course, after this, the whole  affair got by degrees into the papers. Dr. Polperro, who was a  familiar person in literary and artistic society, as it turned out,  brought an action against the so-called expert who had declared  against the genuineness of his alleged Rembrandt, and convicted him  of the grossest ignorance and misstatement. Then paragraphs got  about. The World showed us up in a sarcastic article; and Truth,  which has always been terribly severe upon Sir Charles and all the  other South Africans, had a pungent set of verses on "High Art in  Kimberley." By this means, as we suppose, the affair became known  to Colonel Clay himself; for a week or two later my brother-in-law  received a cheerful little note on scented paper from our persistent  sharper. It was couched in these terms:--    
"Oh, you innocent infant!    
"Bless your ingenuous little heart! And did it believe, then, it  had positively caught the redoubtable colonel? And had it ready a  nice little pinch of salt to put upon his tail? And is it true its  respected name is Sir Simple Simon? How heartily we have laughed,  White Heather and I, at your neat little ruses! It would pay you,  by the way, to take White Heather into your house for six months  to instruct you in the agreeable sport of amateur detectives. Your  charming naivete quite moves our envy. So you actually imagined a  man of my brains would condescend to anything so flat and stale as  the silly and threadbare Old Master deception! And this in the  so-called nineteenth century! O sancta simplicitas! When again  shall such infantile transparency be mine? When, ah, when? But never  mind, dear friend. Though you didn't catch me, we shall meet before  long at some delightful Philippi.    
"Yours, with the profoundest respect and gratitude,    
"ANTONIO HERRERA,    
"Otherwise RICHARD PEPLOE BRABAZON."    
Charles laid down the letter with a deep-drawn sigh. "Sey, my boy,"  he mused aloud, "no fortune on earth--not even mine--can go on  standing it. These perpetual drains begin really to terrify me. I  foresee the end. I shall die in a workhouse. What with the money he  robs me of when he <i>is</i> Colonel Clay, and the money I waste upon him  when he <i>isn't</i> Colonel Clay, the man is beginning to tell upon my  nervous system. I shall withdraw altogether from this worrying life.  I shall retire from a scheming and polluted world to some untainted  spot in the fresh, pure mountains."    
"You <i>must</i> need rest and change," I said, "when you talk like that.  Let us try the Tyrol."
