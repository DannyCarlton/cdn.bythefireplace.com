  During the next quarter of an hour David was as silent as the old   Indian doctor. He was conscious of no pain when Nepapinas took off   his bandage and bathed his head in the lotion he had brought.  Before  a fresh bandage was put on, he looked at himself for a  moment in the  mirror. It was the first time he had seen his wound,  and he expected  to find himself marked with a disfiguring scar. To  his surprise there  was no sign of his hurt except a slightly  inflamed spot above his  temple. He stared at Nepapinas, and there  was no need of the question  that was in his mind. 
  The old Indian understood, and his dried-up face cracked and   crinkled in a grin. &quot;Bullet hit a piece of rock, an' rock, not   bullet, hit um head,&quot; he explained. &quot;Make skull almost break&#8212;bend  um  in&#8212;but Nepapinas straighten again with fingers, so-so.&quot; He  shrugged  his thin shoulders with a cackling laugh of pride as he  worked his  claw-like fingers to show how the operation had been  done. 
  David shook hands with him in silence; then Nepapinas put on the   fresh bandage, and after that went out, chuckling again in his  weird  way, as though he had played a great joke on the white man  whom his  wizardry had snatched out of the jaws of death. 
  For some time there had been a subdued activity outside. The   singing of the boatmen had ceased, a low voice was giving  commands,  and looking through the window, David saw that the  bateau was slowly  swinging away from the shore. He turned from the  window to the table  and lighted the cigar St. Pierre's wife had  given him. 
  In spite of the mental struggle he had made during the presence of   Nepapinas, he had failed to get a grip on himself. For a time he  had  ceased to be David Carrigan, the man-hunter. A few days ago  his blood  had run to that almost savage thrill of the great game  of one against  one, the game in which Law sat on one side of the  board and  Lawlessness on the other, with the cards between. It was  the great  gamble. The cards meant life or death; there was never a   checkmate&#8212;one or the other had to lose. Had some one told him  then  that soon he would meet the broken and twisted hulk of a man  who had  known Black Roger Audemard, every nerve in him would have  thrilled in  anticipation of that hour. He realized this as he  paced back and forth  over the thick rugs of the bateau floor. And  he knew, even as he  struggled to bring them back, that the old  thrill and the old desire  were gone. It was impossible to lie to  himself. St. Pierre, in this  moment, was of more importance to him  than Roger Audemard. And St.  Pierre's wife, Marie-Anne&#8212; 
  His eyes fell on the crumpled handkerchief on the piano keys.   Again he was crushing it in the palm of his hand, and again the  flood  of humiliation and shame swept over him. He dropped the  handkerchief,  and the great law of his own life seemed to rise up  in his face and  taunt him. He was clean. That had been his  greatest pride. He hated  the man who was unclean. It was his  instinct to kill the man who  desecrated another man's home. And  here, in the sacredness of St.  Pierre's paradise, he found himself  at last face to face with that  greatest fight of all the ages. 
  He faced the door. He threw back his shoulders until they snapped,   and he laughed, as if at the thing that had risen up to point its   finger at him. After all, it did not hurt a man to go through a  bit  of fire&#8212;if he came out of it unburned. And deep in his heart  he knew  it was not a sin to love, even as he loved, if he kept  that love to  himself. What he had done when Marie-Anne stood at  the window he could  not undo. St. Pierre would probably have  killed him for touching her  hair with his lips, and he would not  have blamed St. Pierre. But she  had not felt that stolen caress.  No one knew&#8212;but himself. And he was  happier because of it. It was  a sort of sacred thing, even though it  brought the heat of shame  into his face. 
  He went to the door, opened it, and stood out in the sunshine. It   was good to feel the warmth of the sun in his face again and the   sweet air of the open day in his lungs. The bateau was free of the   shore and drifting steadily towards midstream. Bateese was at the   great birchwood rudder sweep, and to David's surprise he nodded in  a  friendly way, and his wide mouth broke into a grin. 
  &quot;Ah, it is coming soon, that fight of ours, little coq de   bruyere!&quot; he chuckled gloatingly. &quot;An' ze fight will be jus' lak   that, m'sieu&#8212;you ze little fool-hen's rooster, ze partridge, an'  I,  Concombre Bateese, ze eagle!&quot; 
  The anticipation in the half-breed's eyes reflected itself for an   instant in David's. He turned back into the cabin, bent over his   pack, and found among his clothes two pairs of boxing gloves. He   fondled them with the loving touch of a brother and comrade, and   their velvety smoothness was more soothing to his nerves than the   cigar he was smoking. His one passion above all others was boxing,   and wherever he went, either on pleasure or adventure, the gloves   went with him. In many a cabin and shack of the far hinterland he  had  taught white men and Indians how to use them, so that he might  have  the pleasure of feeling the thrill of them on his hands. And  now here  was Concombre Bateese inviting him on, waiting for him to  get well! 
  He went out and dangled the clumsy-looking mittens under the half-   breed's nose. 
  Bateese looked at them curiously. &quot;Mitaines,&quot; he nodded. &quot;Does ze   little partridge rooster keep his claws warm in those in ze  winter?  They are clumsy, m'sieu. I can make a better mitten of  caribou skin.&quot;  Putting on one of the gloves, David doubled up his  fist. &quot;Do you see  that, Concombre Bateese?&quot; he asked. &quot;Well, I  will tell you this, that  they are not mittens to keep your hands  warm. I am going to fight you  in them when our time comes. With  these mittens I will fight you and  your naked fists. Why? Because  I do not want to hurt you too badly,  friend Bateese! I do not want  to break your face all to pieces, which  I would surely do if I did  not put on these soft mittens. Then, when  you have really learned  to fight&#8212;&quot; 
  The bull neck of Concombre Bateese looked as if it were about to   burst. His eyes seemed ready to pop out of their sockets, and   suddenly he let out a roar. &quot;What!&#8212;You dare talk lak that to   Concombre Bateese, w'at is great'st fightin' man on all T'ree  River?  You talk lak that to me, Concombre Bateese, who will kill  ze bear wit'  hees ban's, who pull down ze tree, who&#8212;who&#8212;&quot; 
  The word-flood of his outraged dignity sprang to his lips; emotion   choked him, and then, looking suddenly over Carrigan's shoulder&#8212;  he  stopped. Something in his look made David turn. Three paces  behind him  stood Marie-Anne, and he knew that from the corner of  the cabin she  had heard what had passed between them. She was  biting her lips, and  behind the flash of her eyes he saw laughter. 
  &quot;You must not quarrel, children,&quot; she said. &quot;Bateese, you are   steering badly.&quot; 
  She reached out her hands, and without a word David gave her the   gloves. With her palm and fingers she caressed them softly, yet  David  saw little lines of doubt come into her white forehead. 
  &quot;They are pretty&#8212;and soft, M'sieu David. Surely they can not hurt   much! Some day when St. Pierre comes, will you teach me how to use   them?&quot; 
  &quot;Always it is 'When St. Pierre comes,'&quot; he replied. &quot;Shall we be   waiting long?&quot; 
  &quot;Two or three days, perhaps a little longer. Are you coming with   me to the proue, m'sieu?&quot; 
  She did not wait for his answer, but went ahead of him, dangling   the two pairs of gloves at her side. David caught a last glimpse  of  the half-breed's face as he followed Marie-Anne around the end  of the  cabin. Bateese was making a frightful grimace and shaking  his huge  fist, but scarcely were they out of sight on the narrow  footway that  ran between the cabin and the outer timbers of the  scow when a huge  roar of laughter followed them. Bateese had not  done laughing when  they reached the proue, or bow-nest, a deck  fully ten feet in length  by eight in width, sheltered above by an  awning, and comfortably  arranged with chairs, several rugs, a  small table, and, to David's  amazement, a hammock. He had never  seen anything like this on the  Three Rivers, nor had he ever heard  of a scow so large or so  luxuriously appointed. Over his head, at  the tip of a flagstaff  attached to the forward end of the cabin,  floated the black and white  pennant of St. Pierre Boulain. And  under this staff was a screened  door which undoubtedly opened into  the kitchenette which Marie-Anne  had told him about. He made no  effort to hide his surprise. But St.  Pierre's wife seemed not to  notice it. The puckery little lines were  still in her forehead,  and the laughter had faded out of her eyes. The  tiny lines  deepened as there came another wild roar of laughter from  Bateese  in the stern. 
  &quot;Is it true that you have given your word to fight Bateese?&quot; she   asked. 
  &quot;It is true, Marie-Anne. And I feel that Bateese is looking ahead   joyously to the occasion.&quot; 
  &quot;He is,&quot; she affirmed. &quot;Last night he spread the news among all my   people. Those who left to join St. Pierre this morning have taken  the  news with them, and there is a great deal of excitement and  much  betting. I am afraid you have made a bad promise. No man has  offered  to fight Bateese in three years&#8212;not even my great St.  Pierre, who  says that Concombre is more than a match for him.&quot; 
  &quot;And yet they must have a little doubt, as there is betting, and   it takes two to make a bet,&quot; chuckled David. 
  The lines went out of Marie-Anne's forehead, and a half-smile   trembled on her red lips. &quot;Yes, there is betting. But those who  are  for you are offering next autumn's muskrat skins and frozen  fish  against lynx and fisher and marten. The odds are about thirty  to one  against you, M'sieu David!&quot; 
  The look of pity which was clearly in her eyes brought a rush of   blood to David's face. &quot;If only I had something to wager!&quot; he   groaned. 
  &quot;You must not fight. I shall forbid it!&quot; 
  &quot;Then Bateese and I will steal off into the forest and have it out   by ourselves.&quot; 
  &quot;He will hurt you badly. He is terrible, like a great beast, when   he fights. He loves to fight and is always asking if there is not   some one who will stand up to him. I think he would desert even me   for a good fight. But you, M'sieu David&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I also love a fight,&quot; he admitted, unashamed. 
  St. Pierre's wife studied him thoughtfully for a moment. &quot;With   these?&quot; she asked then, holding up the gloves. 
  &quot;Yes, with those. Bateese may use his fists, but I shall use   those, so that I shall not disfigure him permanently. His face is   none too handsome as it is.&quot; 
  For another flash her lips trembled on the edge of a smile. Then   she gave him the gloves, a bit troubled, and nodded to a chair  with a  deep, cushioned seat and wide arms. &quot;Please make yourself  comfortable,  M'sieu David. I have something to do in the cabin and  will return in a  little while.&quot; 
  He wondered if she had gone back to settle the matter with Bateese   at once, for it was clear that she did not regard with favor the   promised bout between himself and the half-breed. It was on the  spur  of a careless moment that he had promised to fight Bateese,  and with  little thought that it was likely to be carried out or  that it would  become a matter of importance with all of St.  Pierre's brigade. He was  evidently in for it, he told himself, and  as a fighting man it looked  as though Concombre Bateese was at  least the equal of his braggadocio.  He was glad of that. He  grinned as he watched the bending backs of St.  Pierre's men. So  they were betting thirty to one against him! Even St.  Pierre might  be induced to bet&#8212;with HIM. And if he did&#8212; 
  The hot blood leaped for a moment in Carrigan's veins. The thrill   went to the tips of his fingers. He stared out over the river,   unseeing, as the possibilities of the thing that had come into his   mind made him for a moment oblivious of the world. He possessed  one  thing against which St. Pierre and St. Pierre's wife would  wager a  half of all they owned in the world! And if he should  gamble that one  thing, which had come to him like an inspiration,  and should whip  Bateese&#8212; 
  He began to pace back and forth over the narrow deck, no longer   watching the rowers or the shore. The thought grew, and his mind  was  consumed by it. Thus far, from the moment the first shot was  fired at  him from the ambush, he had been playing with adventure  in the dark.  But fate had at last dealt him a trump card. That  something which he  possessed was more precious than furs or gold  to St. Pierre, and St.  Pierre would not refuse the wager when it  was offered. He would not  dare refuse. More than that, he would  accept eagerly, strong in the  faith that Bateese would whip him as  he had whipped all other fighters  who had come up against him  along the Three Rivers. And when  Marie-Anne knew what that wager  was to be, she, too, would pray for  the gods of chance to be with  Concombre Bateese! 
  He did not hear the light footsteps behind him, and when he turned   suddenly in his pacing, he found himself facing Marie-Anne, who   carried in her hands the little basket he had seen on the cabin   table. She seated herself in the hammock and took from the basket  a  bit of lace work. For a moment he watched her fingers flashing  in and  out with the needles. 
  Perhaps his thought went to her. He was almost frightened as he   saw her cheeks coloring under the long, dark lashes. He faced the   rivermen again, and while he gripped at his own weakness, he tried  to  count the flashings of their oars. And behind him, the  beautiful eyes  of St. Pierre's wife were looking at him with a  strange glow in their  depths. 
  &quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, speaking slowly and still looking toward   the flashing of the oars, &quot;something tells me that unexpected  things  are going to happen when St. Pierre returns. I am going to  make a bet  with him that I can whip Bateese. He will not refuse.  He will accept.  And St. Pierre will lose, because I shall whip  Bateese. It is then  that these unexpected things will begin to  happen. And I am  wondering&#8212;after they do happen&#8212;if you will care  so very much?&quot; 
  There was a moment of silence. And then, &quot;I don't want you to   fight Bateese,&quot; she said. 
  The needles were working swiftly when he turned toward her again,   and a second time the long lashes shadowed what a moment before he   might have seen in her eyes.
