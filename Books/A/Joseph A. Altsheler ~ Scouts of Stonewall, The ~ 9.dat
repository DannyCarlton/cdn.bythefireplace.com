  Harry was awakened at the first shoot of dawn by the sound of  trumpets.  It was now approaching the last of May and the cold nights  had long since  passed.  A warm sun was fast showing its edge in the  east, and, bathing  his face at a brook and snatching a little  breakfast, he was ready.  Stonewall Jackson was already up, and his  colored servant was holding  Little Sorrel for him. 
  The army was fast forming into line, the new men of Ewell resolved  to  become as famous foot cavalry as those who had been with Jackson  all  along.  Ewell himself, full of enthusiasm and already devoted to  his  chief, was riding among them, and whenever he spoke to one of them  he  cocked his head on one side in the peculiar manner that was  habitual with  him.  Now and then, as the sun grew warmer, he took off  his hat and his  bald head gleamed under the yellow rays. 
  &#8220;Which way do you think we're going?&#8221; said the young staff officer,   George Dalton, to Harry&#8212;Dalton was a quiet youth with a good deal of  the  Puritan about him and Harry liked him. 
  &#8220;I'm not thinking about it at all,&#8221; replied Harry with a laugh.   &#8220;I've  quit trying to guess what our general is going to do, but I  fancy that he  means to lead us against the enemy.  He has the numbers  now.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose you're right,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;I've been trying to guess  all  along, but I think I'll give it up now and merely follow where the   general leads.&#8221; 
  The bugles blew, the troops rapidly fell into line and marched  northward  along the turnpike, the Creole band began to play again one  of those  lilting waltz tunes, and the speed of the men increased,  their feet  rising and falling swiftly to the rhythm of the galloping  air.  Jackson,  who was near the head of the column, looked back and  Harry saw a faint  smile pass over his grim face.  He saw the value of  the music. 
  &#8220;I never heard such airs in our Presbyterian church,&#8221; said Dalton  to  Harry. 
  &#8220;But this isn't a church.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, it isn't, but those Creole tunes suit here.  They put fresh  life  into me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Same here.  And they help the men, too.  Look how gay they are.&#8221; 
  Up went the shining sun.  The brilliant blue light, shot with gold,   spread from horizon to horizon, little white clouds of vapor, tinted  at  the edges with gold from the sun, floated here and there.  It was   beautiful May over all the valley.  White dust flew from the turnpike   under the feet of so many marching men and horses, and the wheels of   cannon.  Suddenly the Georgia troops that had suffered so severely at   McDowell began to sing a verse from the Stars and Bars, and gradually  the  whole column joined in: 
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8220;Now Georgia marches to the front <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And close beside her come <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her sisters by the Mexique sea <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With pealing trump and drum, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till answering back from hill and glen <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rallying cry afar, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A nation hoists the Bonnie Blue Flag <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That bears a single star.&#8221; 
  It was impossible not to feel emotion.  The face of the most solemn   Presbyterian of them all flushed and his eyes glowed.  Now the band,   that wonderful band of the Acadians, was playing the tune, and the  mighty  chorus rolled and swelled across the fields.  Harry's heart  throbbed  hard.  He was with the South, his own South, and he was  swayed wholly by  feeling. 
  The Acadians were leading the army.  Harry saw Jackson whispering   something to a staff officer.  The officer galloped forward and spoke  to  Taylor, the commander of the Louisiana troops.  Instantly the  Acadians  turned sharply from the turnpike and walked in a diagonal  line through  the fields.  The whole army followed and they marched  steadily northward  and eastward. 
  Harry had another good and close view of the Massanuttons, now one  vast  mass of dark green foliage, and it caused his thoughts to turn to   Shepard.  He had no doubt that the wary and astute Northern scout was   somewhere near watching the march of Stonewall.  He had secured a pair  of  glasses of his own and he scanned the fields and forests now for a  sight  of him and his bold horsemen.  But he saw no blue uniforms,  merely  farmers and their wives and children, shouting with joy at the  sight of  Jackson, eager to give him information, and eager to hide it  from Banks. 
  But Harry was destined to have more than another view of the   Massanuttons.  Jackson marched steadily for four days, crossing the   Massanuttons at the defile, and coming down into the eastern valley.   The troops were joyous throughout the journey, although they had not  the  least idea for what they were destined, and Ewell's men made good  their  claim to a place of equal honor in the foot cavalry. 
  They were now in the division of the great valley known as the  Luray,  and only when they stopped did Harry and his comrades of the  staff learn  that the Northern army under Kenly was only ten miles away  at Front Royal. 
  The preceding night had been one of great confidence, even of  light-  heartedness in Washington.  The worn and melancholy President  felt that a  triumphant issue of the war was at hand.  The Secretary of  War was more  than sanguine, and the people in the city joyfully  expected speedy news  of the fall of Richmond.  McClellan was advancing  with an overwhelming  force on the Southern capital, and the few  regiments of Jackson were lost  somewhere in the mountains.  In the  west all things were going well under  Grant. 
  It was only a few who, recognizing that the army of Jackson was  lost to  Northern eyes, began to ask questions about it.  But they were  laughed  down.  Jackson had too few men to do any harm, wherever he  might be.  Nobody suspected that at dawn Jackson, with a strong force,  would be only  a little more than three score miles from the Union  capital itself.  Even Banks himself, who was only half that distance  from the Southern  army, did not dream that it was coming. 
  When the sun swung clear that May morning there was a great elation  in  this army which had been lost to its enemies for days and which the   unknowing despised.  They ate a good breakfast, and then, as the  Creole  band began to play its waltzes again, they advanced swiftly on  Front  Royal. 
  &#8220;We'll be attacking in two hours,&#8221; said Dalton. 
  &#8220;In less time than that, I'm thinking,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;Look how the  men  are speeding it up!&#8221; 
  The band ceased suddenly.  Harry surmised that it had been stopped,   in order to suppress noise as much as possible, now that they were   approaching the enemy.  Cheering and loud talking also were stopped,   and they heard now the heavy beat of footsteps, horses and men, and  the  rumble of vehicles, cannon and wagons.  The morning was bright and  hot.  A haze of heat hung over the mountains, and to Harry the valley  was more  beautiful and picturesque than ever.  He had again flitting  feelings of  melancholy that it should be torn so ruthlessly by war. 
  If Shepard and other Northern scouts were near, they were lax that   morning.  Not a soul in the garrison at Front Royal dreamed of  Jackson's  swift approach.  They were soon to have a terrible  awakening. 
  Harry saw Jackson raise the visor of his old cap a little, and he  saw the  eyes beneath it gleam. 
  &#8220;We must be near Front Royal,&#8221; he said to Dalton. 
  &#8220;It's just beyond the woods there.  It's not more than half a mile  away.&#8221; 
  The army halted a moment and Jackson sent forward a long line of   skirmishers through the wood.  Sherburne's cavalry were to ride just   behind them, and he dispatched Harry and Dalton with the captain.  At  the first sound of the firing the whole army would rush upon Front   Royal. 
  The skirmishers, five hundred strong, pressed forward through the  wood.  They were sun-browned, eager fellows, every one carrying a  rifle, and all  sharpshooters. 
  It seemed to Harry that the skirmishers were through the wood in an   instant, like a force of Indians bursting from ambush upon an   unsuspecting foe.  The Northern pickets were driven in like leaves  before  a whirlwind.  The rattle and then the crash of rifles beat upon  the ears,  and the Southern horsemen were galloping through the streets  of the  startled village by the time the Northern commander, posted  with his main  force just behind the town, knew that Jackson had  emerged from the  wilderness and was upon him.  Banks not dreaming of  Jackson's nearness,  had taken away Kenly's cavalry, and there were  only pickets to see. 
  The Northern commander was brave and capable.  He drew up his men  rapidly  on a ridge and planted his guns in front, but the storm was  too heavy and  swift. 
  Harry saw the front of the Southern army burst into fire, and then  a  deadly sleet of shell and bullets was poured upon the Northern  force.  He and Dalton did not have time to rejoin Jackson, but they  kept with  Sherburne's force as the group of wild horsemen swung around  toward the  Northern rear, intending to cut it off. 
  Harry heard the Southern bugles playing mellow and triumphant  tunes,  and they inflamed his brain.  All the little pulses in his head  began to  beat heavily.  Millions of black specks danced before his  eyes, but the  air about them was red.  He began to shout with the  others.  The famous  rebel yell, which had in it the menacing quality  of the Indian war whoop,  was already rolling from the half circle of  the attacking army, as it  rushed forward. 
  Kenly hung to his ground, fighting with the courage of desperation,   and holding off for a little while the gray masses that rushed upon  him.  But when he heard that the cavalry of Sherburne was already  behind him,  and was about to gain a position between him and the  river, he retreated  as swiftly as he could, setting fire to all his  tents and stores, and  thundering in good order with his remaining  force over the bridge. 
  These Northern men, New Yorkers largely, were good material, like  their  brethren of Ohio and West Virginia.  Despite the surprise and  the  overwhelming rush of Jackson, they stopped to set fire to the  bridge,  and they would have closed that avenue of pursuit had not the  Acadians  rushed forward, heedless of bullets and flames, and put it  out.  Yet the  bridge was damaged and the Southern pursuit could cross  but slowly.  Kenly, seeing his advantage, and cool and ready, drew up  his men on a  hill and poured a tremendous fire upon the bridge. 
  Harry saw the daring deed of the men from the Gulf coast, and he  clapped  his hands in delight.  But he had only a moment's view.   Sherburne was  curving away in search of a ford and all his men  galloped close behind  him. 
  Near the town the river was deep and swift and the horsemen would  be  swept away by it, but willing villagers running at the horses'  heads led  them to fords farther down. 
  &#8220;Into the river, boys!&#8221; shouted Sherburne, as he with Harry and  Dalton by  his side galloped into the stream.  It seemed to Harry that  the whole  river was full of horsemen in an instant, and then he saw  Stonewall  Jackson himself, riding Little Sorrel into the stream. 
  Harry's horse stumbled once on the rocky bottom, but recovered his   footing, and the boy urged him on toward the bank, bumping on either  side  against those who were as eager as he.  He was covered with water  and  foam, churned up by so many horses, but he did not notice it.  In  a  minute his horse put his forefeet upon the bank, pulled himself up,   and then they were all formed up by Jackson himself for the pursuit. 
  &#8220;They run!  They run already!&#8221; cried Sherburne. 
  They were not running, exactly, but Kenly, always alert and cool,  had  seen the passage of the ford by the Virginians, and unlimbering  his guns,  was retreating in good order, but swiftly, his rear covered  by the New  York cavalry. 
  Now Harry saw all the terrors of war.  It was not sufficient for  Jackson  to defeat the enemy.  He must follow and destroy him.  More of  his army  crossed at the fords and more poured over the bridge. 
  The New York cavalry, despite courage and tenacity, could not  withstand  the onset of superior numbers.  They were compelled to give  way, and  Kenly ordered his infantry, retreating on the turnpike, to  turn and help  them.  Jackson had not waited for his artillery, but his  riflemen poured  volley after volley of bullets upon the beaten army,  while his cavalry,  galloping in the fields, charged it with sabers on  either flank. 
  Harry was scarcely conscious of what he was doing.  He was slashing  with  his sword and shooting with the rest.  Sometimes his eyes were  filled  with dust and smoke and then again they would clear.  He heard  the voices  of officers shouting to both cavalry and infantry to  charge, and then  there was a confused and terrible melee. 
  Harry never remembered much of that charge, and he was glad that he  did  not.  He preferred that it should remain a blur in which he could  not  pick out the details.  He was conscious of the shock, when horse  met  horse and body met body.  He saw the flash of rifle and pistol  shots,  and the gleam of sabers through the smoke, and he heard a  continuous  shouting kept up by friend and foe. 
  Then he felt the Northern army, struck with such terrific force,  giving  way.  Kenly had made a heroic stand, but he could no longer  support the  attacks from all sides.  One of his cannon was taken and  then all.  He himself fell wounded terribly.  His senior officers also  fell, as they  tried to rally their men, who were giving way at all  points. 
  Sherburne wheeled his troop away again and charged at the Northern   cavalry, which was still in order.  Harry had seen Jackson himself  give  the command to the captain.  It was the redoubtable commander who  saw all  and understood all, who always struck, with his sword directly  at the  weak point in the enemy's armor.  Harry saw that eye glittering  as he had  never seen it glitter before, and the command was given in  words of fire  that communicated a like fire to every man in the troop. 
  The Northern cavalry cut to pieces, Kenly's whole army dissolved.   The attack was so terrific, so overwhelming, and was pushed home so  hard,  that panic ran through the ranks of those brave men.  They fled  through  the orchards and the fields, and Jackson never ceased to urge  on the  pursuit, taking whole companies here and there, and seizing  scattered  fugitives. 
  Ashby, with the chief body of the cavalry, galloped on ahead to a  railway  station, where Pennsylvania infantry were on guard.  They had  just got  ready a telegraphic message to Banks for help, but his men  rushed the  station before it could be sent, tore up the railroad  tracks, cut the  telegraph wires, carried by storm a log house in which  the Pennsylvanians  had taken refuge, and captured them all. 
  The Northern army had ceased to exist.  Save for some fugitives, it  had  all fallen or was in the hands of Jackson, and the triumphant  cheers of  the Southerners rang over the field.  Banks, at Strasburg,  not far away,  did not know that Kenly's force had been destroyed.   Three hours after  the attack had been made, an orderly covered with  dust galloped into his  camp and told him that Kenly was pressed  hard&#8212;he did not know the full  truth himself. 
  Banks, whose own force was cut down by heavy drafts to the  eastward,  was half incredulous.  It was impossible that Jackson could  be at Front  Royal.  He was fifty or sixty miles away, and the attack  must be some  cavalry raid which would soon be beaten off.  He sent a  regiment and two  guns to see what was the matter.  He telegraphed  later to the Secretary  of War at Washington that a force of several  thousand rebels gathered in  the mountains was pushing Kenly hard. 
  Meanwhile the victorious Southerners were spending a few moments in   enjoying their triumph.  They captured great quantities of food and   clothing which Kenly had not found time to destroy, and which they   joyously divided among themselves. 
  Harry found the two colonels and all the rest of the Invincibles  lying  upon the ground in the fields.  Some of them were wounded, but  most were  unhurt.  They were merely panting from exhaustion.  Colonel  Leonidas  Talbot sat up when he saw Harry, and Lieutenant-Colonel  Hector  St. Hilaire also sat up. 
  &#8220;Good afternoon, Harry,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot, politely.  &#8220;It's been  a  warm day.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But a victorious one, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Victorious, yes; but it is not finished.  I fancy that in spite of   everything we have not yet learned the full capabilities of General   Jackson, eh, Hector?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, sir, we haven't,&#8221; replied Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St.  Hilaire,  emphatically.  &#8220;I never saw such an appetite for battle.  In  Mexico  General Winfield Scott would press the enemy hard, but he was  not anxious  to march twenty miles and fight a battle every day.&#8221; 
  Harry found St. Clair and Langdon not far away from their chief  officers.  St. Clair had brushed the dust off his clothing, but he was  regarding  ruefully two bullet holes in the sleeve of his fine gray  tunic. 
  &#8220;He has neither needle nor thread with which to sew up those  holes,&#8221;  said Langdon, with wicked glee, &#8220;and he must go into battle  again with a  tunic more holy than righteous.  It's been a bad day for  clothes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A man doesn't fight any worse because he's particular about his  uniform,  does he?&#8221; asked St. Clair. 
  &#8220;You don't.  That's certain, old fellow,&#8221; said Langdon, clapping  him on  the back.  &#8220;And just think how much worse it might have been.   Those  bullets, instead of merely going through your coat sleeve,  might have  gone through your arm also, shattering every bone in it.   Now, Harry,  you ride with Old Jack.  Tell us what he means to do.   Are we going to  rest on our rich and numerous laurels, or is it up  and after the Yanks  hot-foot?&#8221; 
  &#8220;He's not telling me anything,&#8221; replied Harry, &#8220;but I think it's  safe to  predict that we won't take any long and luxurious rest.  Nor  will we ever  take any long and luxurious rest while we're led by  Stonewall Jackson.&#8221; 
  Jackson marched some distance farther toward Strasburg, where the  army of  Banks, yet unbelieving, lay, and as the night was coming on  thick and  black with clouds, went into camp.  But among their captured  stores they  had ample food now, and tents and blankets to protect  themselves from the  promised rain. 
  The Acadians, who were wonderful cooks, showed great culinary skill  as  well as martial courage.  They were becoming general favorites, and  they  prepared all sorts of appetizing dishes, which they shared freely  with  the Virginians, the Georgians and the others.  Then the  irrepressible  band began.  In the fire-lighted woods and on the ground  yet stained by  the red of battle, it played quaint old tunes, waltzes  and polkas and  roundelays, and once more the stalwart Pierres and  Raouls and Luciens and  Etiennes, clasping one another in their arms,  whirled in wild dances  before the fires. 
  The heavy clouds opened bye and bye, and then all save the  sentinels fled  to shelter.  Harry and Dalton, who had been watching  the dancing, went to  a small tent which had been erected for  themselves and two more.  Next to  it was a tent yet smaller, occupied  by the commander-in-chief, and as  they passed by it they heard low but  solemn tones lifted in invocation to  God.  Harry could not keep from  taking one fleeting glance.  He saw  Jackson on his knees, and then he  went quickly on. 
  The other two officers had not yet come, and Dalton and he were  alone in  the tent.  It was too dark inside for Harry to see Dalton's  face, but he  knew that his comrade, too, had seen and heard. 
  &#8220;It will be hard to beat a general who prays,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;Some  of our  men laugh at Jackson's praying, but I've always heard that the  Puritans,  whether in England or America, were a stern lot to face.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The enemy at least won't laugh at him.  I've heard that they had  great  fun deriding a praying professor of mathematics, but I fancy  they've quit  it.  If they haven't they'll do so when they hear of  Front Royal.&#8221; 
  The tent was pitched on the bare ground, but they had obtained four   planks, every one about a foot wide and six feet or so long.  They  were  sufficient to protect them from the rain which would run under  the tent  and soak into the ground.  Harry had long since learned that  a tent and a  mere strip of plank were a great luxury, and now he  appreciated them at  their full value. 
  He wrapped himself in the invaluable cloak, stretched his weary  body upon  his own particular plank, and was soon asleep.  He was  awakened in the  night by a low droning sound.  He did not move on his  plank, but lay  until his eyes became used partially to the darkness.   Then he saw two  other figures also wrapped in their cloaks and  stretched on their planks,  dusky and motionless.  But the fourth  figure was kneeling on his plank  and Harry saw that it was Dalton,  praying even as Stonewall Jackson had  prayed. 
  Then Harry shut his eyes.  He was not devout himself, but in the  darkness  of the night, with the rain beating a tattoo on the canvas  walls of the  tent, he felt very solemn.  This was war, red war, and he  was in the  midst of it.  War meant destruction, wounds, agony and  death.  He might  never again see Pendleton and his father and his aunt  and his cousin,  Dick Mason, and Dr. Russell and all his boyhood and  school friends.  It was no wonder that George Dalton prayed.  He ought  to be praying  himself, and lying there and not stirring he said under  his breath a  simple prayer that his mother had taught him when he was  yet a little  child. 
  Then he fell asleep again, and awoke no more until the dawn.  But  while  Harry slept the full dangers of his situation became known to  Banks far  after midnight at Strasburg.  The regiment and the two guns  that he had  sent down the turnpike to relieve Kenly had been fired  upon so  incessantly by Southern pickets and riflemen that they were  compelled to  turn back.  Everywhere the Northern scouts and  skirmishers were driven  in.  Despite the darkness and rain they found  a wary foe whom they could  not pass. 
  It was nearly two o'clock in the morning when Banks was aroused by  a  staff officer who said that a man insisted upon seeing him.  The  man,  the officer said, claimed to have news that meant life or death,  and he  carried on his person a letter from President Lincoln,  empowering him to  go where he pleased.  He had shown that letter, and  his manner indicated  the most intense and overpowering anxiety. 
  Banks was surprised, and he ordered that the stranger be shown in  at  once.  A tall man, wrapped in a long coat of yellow oilcloth,  dripping  rain, was brought into the room.  He held a faded blue cap in  his hand,  and the general noticed that the hand was sinewy and  powerful.  The front  of the coat was open a little at the top,  disclosing a dingy blue coat.  His high boots were spattered to the  tops with mud. 
  There was something in the man's stern demeanor and his intense,  burning  gaze that daunted Banks, who was a brave man himself.   Moreover, the  general was but half dressed and had risen from a warm  couch, while the  man before him had come in on the storm, evidently  from some great danger,  and his demeanor showed that he was ready for  other and instant dangers.  For the moment the advantage was with the  stranger, despite the  difference in rank. 
  &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; asked the general. 
  &#8220;My name, sir, is Shepard, William J. Shepard.  I am a spy or a  scout in  the Union service.  I have concealed upon me a letter from  President  Lincoln, empowering me to act in such a capacity and to go  where I  please.  Do you wish to see it, sir?&#8221; 
  Shepard spoke with deference, but there was no touch of servility  in his  tone. 
  &#8220;Show me the letter,&#8221; said Banks. 
  Shepard thrust a hand into his waistcoat and withdrew a document  which he  handed to the general.  Banks glanced through it rapidly. 
  &#8220;It's from Lincoln,&#8221; he said; &#8220;I know that handwriting, but it  would not  be well for you to be captured with that upon you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If I were about to be captured I should destroy it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Why have you come here?  What message do you bring?&#8221; 
  &#8220;The worst possible message, sir.  Stonewall Jackson and an army of   twenty thousand men will be upon you in the morning.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What!  What is this you say!  It was only a cavalry raid at Front  Royal!&#8221; 
  &#8220;It was no cavalry raid at Front Royal, sir!  It was Jackson and  his  whole army!  I ought to have known, sir!  I should have got there  and  have warned Kenly in time, but I could not!  My horse was killed  by a  rebel sharpshooter in the woods as I was approaching!  I could  not get up  in time, but I saw what happened!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Kenly!  Kenly, where is he?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Mortally wounded or dead, and his army is destroyed!  They made a  brave  stand, even after they were defeated at the village.  They might  have got  away had anybody but Jackson been pursuing.  But he gave them  no chance.  They were enveloped by cavalry and infantry, and only a few  escaped.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Good God!&#8221; exclaimed Banks, aghast. 
  &#8220;Nor is that all, sir.  They are close at hand!  They will attack  you at  dawn!  They are in full force!  Ewell's army has joined Jackson  and  Jackson leads them all!  We must leave Strasburg at once or we are  lost!&#8221; 
  Shepard's manner admitted of no doubt.  Banks hurried forth and  sent  officers to question the pickets.  All the news they brought was   confirmatory.  Even in the darkness and rain shots had been fired at  them  by the Southern skirmishers.  Banks sent for all of his important   officers, the troops were gathered together, and leaving a strong   rear-guard, they began a rapid march toward Winchester, which Jackson  had  loved so well. 
  Swiftness and decision now on the other side had saved the Northern  army  from destruction.  Banks did not realize until later, despite the  urgent  words of Shepard, how formidable was the danger that threatened  him.  Jackson, despite all the disadvantages of the darkness and the  rain,  wished to get his army up before daylight, but the deep mud  formed by the  pouring rain enabled Banks to slip away from the trap. 
  The Southern troops, moreover, were worn to the bone.  They had  come  ninety miles in five days over rough roads, across streams  without  bridges, and over a high mountain, besides fighting a battle  of uncommon  fierceness.  There were limits even to the endurance of  Jackson's foot  cavalry. 
  Harry was first awake in the little tent.  He sat up and looked at  the  other three on their planks who were sleeping as if they would  never wake  any more.  A faint tint of dawn was appearing at the open  flap of the  door.  The four had lain down dressed fully, and Harry, as  he sprang from  his board, cried: 
  &#8220;Up, boys, up!  The army is about to move!&#8221; 
  The three also sprang to their feet, and went outside.  Although  the dawn  was as yet faint, the army was awakening rapidly, or rather  was being  awakened.  The general himself appeared a moment later,  dressed fully,  the end of a lemon in his mouth, his face worn and  haggard by incredible  hardships, but his eyes full of the strength  that comes from an  unconquerable will. 
  He nodded to Harry, Dalton and the others. 
  &#8220;Five minutes for breakfast, gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and then join me  on  horseback, ready for the pursuit of the enemy!&#8221; 
  The few words were like the effects of a galvanic battery on Harry.   Peculiarly susceptible to mental power, Jackson was always a stimulus  to  him.  Close contact revealed to him the fiery soul that lay  underneath  the sober and silent exterior, and, in his own turn, he  caught fire from  it.  Youthful, impressionable and extremely sensitive  to great minds and  great deeds, Stonewall Jackson had become his hero,  who could do no wrong. 
  Five minutes for the hasty breakfast and they were in the saddle  just  behind Jackson.  The rain had ceased, the sun was rising in a  clear sky,  the country was beautiful once more, and down a long line  the Southern  bugles were merrily singing the advance.  Very soon  scattered shots all  along their front showed that they were in touch  with the enemy. 
  The infantry and cavalry left by Banks as a curtain between himself  and  Jackson did their duty nobly that morning.  The pursuit now led  into a  country covered with forest, and using every advantage of such  shelter,  the Northern companies checked the Southern advance as much  as was  humanly possible.  Many of them were good riflemen,  particularly those  from Ohio, and the cavalry of Ashby, Funsten and  Sherburne found the  woods very warm for them.  Horses were falling  continually, and often  their riders fell with them to stay. 
  Harry, in the center with the commander, heard the heavy firing to  both  right and left, and he glanced often at Jackson.  He saw his lips  move as  if he were talking to himself, and he knew that he was  disappointed at  this strong resistance.  Troops could move but slowly  through woods in  the face of a heavy rifle fire, and meanwhile Banks  with his main body  was escaping to Winchester. 
  &#8220;Mr. Kenton,&#8221; said Jackson sharply, &#8220;ride to General Ashby and tell  him  to push the enemy harder!  We must crush at least a portion of  this army!  It is vital!&#8221; 
  Harry was off as soon as the last words left the general's lips.   He  spurred his horse from the turnpike, leaped a low rail fence, and   galloped across a field toward a forest, where Ashby's cavalry were   advancing and the rifles were cracking fast. 
  Bullets from the Northern skirmishers flew over him and beside him,   as he flew about the field, but he thought little of them.  He was   growing so thoroughly inured to war that he seldom realized the  dangers  until they were passed. 
  Neither he nor his horse was hurt&#8212;their very speed, perhaps, saved  them  and they entered the wood, where the Southern cavalry were  riding. 
  &#8220;General Ashby!&#8221; he cried to the first man he saw.  &#8220;Where is he?   I've a message from General Jackson!&#8221; 
  The soldier pointed to a figure on horseback but a short distance  away,  and Harry galloped up. 
  &#8220;General Jackson asks you to press the enemy harder!&#8221; he said to  Ashby.  &#8220;He wishes him to be driven in rapidly!&#8221; 
  A faint flush came into the brown cheeks of Ashby. 
  &#8220;He shall he obeyed,&#8221; he replied.  &#8220;We're about to charge in full  force!  Hold, young man!  You can't go back now!  You must charge with  us!&#8221; 
  He put his hand on Harry's rein as he spoke, and the boy saw that a   strong force of Northern cavalry had now appeared in the fields  directly  between him and his general.  Ashby turned the next instant  to a bugler  at his elbow and exclaimed fiercely: 
  &#8220;Blow!  Blow with all your might!&#8221; 
  The piercing notes of the charge rang forth again and again.   Ashby,  shouting loudly and continuously and waving his sword above  his head,  galloped forward.  His whole cavalry force galloped with him  and swept  down upon the defenders. 
  Nor did Ashby lack support.  The Acadians led by Taylor swung  forward on  a run, and a battery, coming at the double quick,  unlimbered and opened  fire.  Jackson had directed all, he had brought  up the converging lines,  and the whole Northern rear guard, two  thousand cavalry, some infantry  and a battery, were caught.  Just  before them lay the little village of  Middletown, and in an instant  they were driven into its streets, where  they were raked by shot and  shell from the cannon, while the rifles of  the cavalry and of the  Louisiana troops swept them with bullets. 
  Again the Northern soldiers, brave and tenacious though they might  be,  could make no stand against the terrible rush of Jackson's  victorious and  superior numbers.  They had no such leading as their  foes.  The man,  the praying professor, was proving himself everything. 
  As at Front Royal, the Northern force was crushed.  It burst from  the  village in fragments, and fled in many directions.  But Jackson  urged on  the pursuit.  Ashby's cavalry charged again and again, taking  prisoners  everywhere. 
  The people of Middletown, as red-hot for the South as were those of  Front  Royal, rushed from their houses and guided the victors along the  right  roads.  They pointed where two batteries and a train of wagons  were  fleeing toward Winchester, and Ashby, with his cavalry, Harry  still at  his elbow, raced in pursuit.
