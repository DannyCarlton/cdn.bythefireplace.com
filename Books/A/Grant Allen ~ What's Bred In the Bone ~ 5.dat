"There were only two of you, then, in the last carriage?" Guy asked  with deep interest, the very next morning, as Cyril, none the worse  for his long imprisonment, sat quietly in their joint chambers at  Staple Inn, recounting the previous day's adventures.    
"Yes. Only two of us. It was awfully fortunate. And the carriage  that was smashed had nobody at all, except in the first compartment,  which escaped being buried. So there were no lives lost, by a  miracle, you may say. But several of the people in the front part  of the train got terribly shaken."    
"And you and the other man were shut up in the tunnel there for  fifteen hours at a stretch?" Guy went on reflectively.    
"At least fifteen hours," Cyril echoed, without attempting to  correct the slight error of sex, for no man, he thought, is bound  to criminate himself, even in a flirtation. "It was two in the  morning before they dug us quite out. And my companion by that time  was more dead than alive, I can tell you, with watching and terror."    
"Was he, poor fellow?" Guy murmured, with a sympathetic face; for  Cyril had always alluded casually to his fellow-traveller in such  general terms that Guy was as yet unaware there was a lady in the  case. "And is he all right again now, do you know? Have you heard  anything more about him?"    
But before Cyril could answer there came a knock at the door, and  the next moment Mr. Montague Nevitt, without his violin, entered  the room in some haste, all agog with excitement. His face was eager  and his manner cordial. It was clear he was full of some important  tidings.    
"Why, Cyril, my dear fellow," he cried, grasping the painter's hand  with much demonstration of friendly warmth, and wringing it hard  two or three times over, "how delighted I am to see you restored  to us alive and well once more. This is really too happy. What  a marvellous escape! And what a romantic story! All the clubs are  buzzing with it. A charming girl! You'll have to marry her, of  course, that's the necessary climax. You and the young lady are the  staple of news, I see, in very big print, in all the evening papers!"    
Guy drew back at the words with a little start of surprise. "Young  lady!" he cried aghast. "A charming girl, Nevitt! Then the person  who was shut up with you for fifteen hours in the tunnel was a  girl, Cyril!"    
Cyril's handsome face flushed slightly before his brother's scrutinizing  gaze; but he answered with a certain little ill-concealed embarrassment:    
"Oh, I didn't say so, didn't I? Well, she <i>was</i> a girl then, of course;  a certain Miss Clifford. She got in at Chetwood. Her people live  somewhere down there near Tilgate. At least, so I gathered from  what she told me."    
Nevitt stared hard at the painter's eyes, which tried, without  success, to look unconscious.    
"A romance!" he said, slowly, scanning his man with deep interest.  "A romance, I can see. Young, rich, and beautiful. My dear Cyril,  I only wish I'd had half your luck. What a splendid chance, and what  a magnificent introduction! Beauty in distress! A lady in trouble!  You console her alone in a tunnel for fifteen hours by yourself  at a stretch. Heavens, what a tete-a-tete! Did British propriety  ever before allow a man such a glorious opportunity for chivalrous  devotion to a lady of family, face, and fortune?"    
"Was she pretty?" Guy asked, coming down at once to a more realistic  platform.    
Cyril hesitated a moment. "Well, yes," he answered, somewhat curtly,  after a short pause. "She's distinctly good-looking." And he shut  his mouth sharp. But he had said quite enough.    
When a man says that of a girl, and nothing more, in an unconcerned  voice, as if it didn't matter twopence to him, you may be perfectly  sure in your own mind he's very deeply and seriously smitten.    
"And young?" Guy continued.    
"I should say about twenty."    
"And rich beyond the utmost dreams of avarice?" Montague Nevitt  put in, with a faintly cynical smile.    
"Well, I don't know about that," Cyril answered truthfully. "I  haven't the least idea who she is, even. She and I had other things  to think about, you may be sure, boxed up there so long in that  narrow space, and choking for want of air, than minute investigations  into one another's pedigrees."    
"<i>We've</i> got no pedigree," Guy interposed, with a bitter smile. "So  the less she investigates about that the better."    
"But <i>she</i> has, I expect," Nevitt put in hastily; "and if I were you,  Cyril, I'd hunt her up forthwith, while the iron's hot, and find  out all there is to find out about her. Clifford-Clifford? I wonder  whether by any chance she's one of the Devonshire Cliffords, now?  For if so, she might really be worth a man's serious attetion.  They're very good business. They bank at our place; and they're by  no means paupers." For Nevitt was a clerk in the well-known banking  firm of Drummond, Coutts, and Barclay, Limited; and being a man  who didn't mean, as he himself said, "to throw himself away on any  girl for nothing," he kept a sharp look-out on the current account  of every wealthy client with an only daughter.    
Ten minutes later, as the talk ran on, some further light was  unexpectedly thrown upon this interesting topic by the entrance  of the porter with a letter for Cyril. The painter tore it open,  and glanced over it, as Nevitt observed, with evident eagerness.  It was short and curt, but in its own way courteous.    
"'Mr. Reginald Clifford, C.M.G., desires to thank Mr. Cyril  Waring for his kindness and consideration to Miss Clifford during  her temporary incarceration---'    
"Incarceration's good, isn't it? How much does he charge a thousand  for that sort, I wonder?---    
"'during her temporary incarceration in the Lavington tunnel  yesterday. Mrs. and Miss Clifford wish also to express at the same  time their deep gratitude to Mr. Waring for his friendly efforts,  and trust he has experienced no further ill effects from the  unfortunate accident to which he was subjected.    
"'Craighton, Tilgate, Thursday morning.'"    
"She <i>might</i> have written herself," Cyril murmured half aloud. He was  evidently disappointed at this very short measure of correspondence  on the subject.    
But Montague Nevitt took a more cheerful view. "Oh, Reginald  Clifford, of Craighton!" he cried with a smile, his invariable smile.  "I know all about <i>him</i>. He's a friend of Colonel Kelmscott's down  at Tilgate Park. C.M.G., indeed! What a ridiculous old peacock.  He was administrator of St. Kitts once upon a time, I believe, or  was it Nevis or Antigua? I don't quite recollect, I'm afraid; but  anyhow, some comical little speck of a sugary, niggery, West Indian  Island; and he was made a Companion of St. Michael and St. George  when his term was up, just to keep him quiet, don't you know, for  he wanted a knighthood, and to shelve him from being appointed to  a first-class post like Barbados or Trinidad. If it's Elma Clifford  you were shut up with in the tunnel, Cyril, you might do worse,  there's no doubt, and you might do better. She's an only daughter,  and there's a little money at the back of the family, I expect;  but I fancy the Companion of the Fighting Saints lives mainly on  his pension, which, of course, is purely personal, and so dies with  him."    
Cyril folded up the note without noticing Nevitt's words and put it  in his pocket, somewhat carefully and obtrusively. "Thank you," he  said, in a very quiet tone, "I didn't ask you about Miss Clifford's  fortune. When I want information on that point I'll apply for  it plainly. But meanwhile I don't think any lady's name should be  dragged into conversation and bandied about like that, by an absolute  stranger."    
"Oh, now you needn't be huffy," Nevitt answered, with a  still sweeter smile, showing all those pearly teeth of his to the  greatest advantage. "I didn't mean to put your back up, and I'll  tell you what I'll do for you. I'll heap coals of fire on your  head, you ungrateful man. I'll return good for evil. You shall  have an invitation to Mrs. Holker's garden party on Saturday week  at Chetwood Court, and there you'll be almost sure to meet the  beautiful stranger."    
But at that very moment, at Craighton, Tilgate, Mr. Reginald  Clifford, C.M.G., a stiff little withered-up official Briton, half  mummified by long exposure to tropical suns, was sitting in his  drawing-room with Mrs. Clifford, his wife, and discussing--what  subject of all others on earth but the personality of Cyril Waring?    
"Well, it was an awkward situation for Elma, of course, I admit,"  he was chirping out cheerfully, with his back turned by pure force  of habit to the empty grate, and his hands crossed behind him.  "I don't deny it was an awkward situation. Still, there's no harm  done, I hope and trust. Elma's happily not a fanciful or foolishly  susceptible sort of girl. She sees it's a case for mere ordinary  gratitude. And gratitude, in my opinion, towards a person in his  position, is sufficiently expressed once for all by letter. There's  no reason on earth she should ever again see or hear any more of  him."    
"But girls are so romantic," Mrs. Clifford put in doubtfully, with  an anxious air. She herself was by no means romantic to look at,  being, indeed, a person of a certain age, with a plump, matronly  figure, and very staid of countenance; yet there was something in  her eye, for all that, that recalled at times the vivid keenness of  Elma's, and her cheek had once been as delicate and creamy a brown  as her pretty daughter's. "Girls are so romantic," Mrs. Clifford  repeated once more, in a dreamy way, "and she was evidently impressed  by him."    
"Well, I'm glad I made inquiries at once about these two young  men, anyhow, "the Companion of St. Michael and St. George responded  with fervour, clasping his wizened little hands contentedly over  his narrow waistcoat. "It's a precious odd story, and a doubtful  story, and not at all the sort of story one likes one's girl to be  any way mixed up with. For my part, I shall give them a very wide  berth indeed in future; and there's no reason why Elma should ever  knock up against them."    
"Who told you they were nobodies?" Mrs. Clifford inquired, drawing  a wistful sigh.    
"Oh, Tom Clark was at school with them," the ex-administrator continued,  with a very cunning air, "and he knows all about them--has heard  the whole circumstances. Very odd, very odd; never met anything  so queer in all my life; most mysterious and uncanny. They never  had a father; they never had a mother; they never had anybody on  earth they could call their own; they dropped from the clouds, as  it were, one rainy day, without a friend in the world, plump down  into the Charterhouse. There they were well supplied with money,  and spent their holidays with a person at Brighton, who wasn't  even supposed to be their lawful guardian. Looks fishy, doesn't  it? Their names are Cyril and Guy Waring--and that's all they know  of themselves. They were educated like gentlemen till they were  twenty-one years old; and then they were turned loose upon the  world, like a pair of young bears, with a couple of hundred pounds  of capital apiece to shift for themselves with. Uncanny, very;  I don't like the look of it. Not at all the sort of people an  impressionable girl like our Elma should ever be allowed to see  too much of."    
"I don't think she was very much impressed by him," Mrs. Clifford  said with confidence. "I've watched her to see, and I don't think  she's in love with him. But by to-morrow, Reginald, I shall be  able, I'm sure, to tell you for certain."    
The Companion of the Militant Saints glanced rather uneasily across  the hearth-rug at his wife. "It's a marvellous gift, to be sure,  this intuition of yours, Louisa," he said, shaking his head sagely,  and swaying himself gently to and fro on the stone kerb of the  fender. "I frankly confess, my dear, I don't quite understand it.  And Elma's got it too, every bit as bad as you have. Runs in the  family, I suppose--runs somehow in the family. After living with  you now for twenty-two years--yes, twenty-two last April--in every  part of the world and every grade of the service, I'm compelled to  admit that your intuition in these matters is really remarkable--simply  remarkable."    
Mrs. Clifford coloured through her olive-brown skin, exactly like  Elma, and rose with a somewhat embarrassed and half-guilty air,  avoiding her husband's eyes as if afraid to meet them.    
Elma had gone to bed early, wearied out as she was with her long  agony in the tunnel. Mrs. Clifford crept up to her daughter's room  with a silent tread, like some noiseless Oriental, and, putting her  ear to the keyhole, listened outside the door in profound suspense  for several minutes.    
Not a sound from within; not a gentle footfall on the carpeted floor.  For a moment she hesitated; then she turned the handle slowly, and,  peering before her, peeped into the room. Thank Heaven! no snake  signs. Elma lay asleep, with one arm above her head, as peacefully  as a child, after her terrible adventure. Her bosom heaved, but  slowly and regularly. The mother drew a deep breath, and crept down  the stairs with a palpitating heart to the drawing-room again.    
"Reginald," she said, with perfect confidence, relapsing once more  at a bound into the ordinary every-day British matron, "there's no  harm done, I'm sure. She doesn't think of this young man at all.  You may dismiss him from your mind at once and for ever. She's  sleeping like a baby."
