Strange to say, in spite of everything, my sleep refreshed me. I  woke up in the morning strong and vigorous--thank goodness, I have  physically a magnificent constitution--and packed my box, with  Jane's help, for my Torquay expedition.    
I went up to London and down to Torquay alone, though Jane offered  to accompany me. I was learning to be self-reliant. It suited my  plans better. Nobody could bear this burden for me but myself; and  the sooner I learnt to bear it my own way, the happier for me.    
At Torquay station, to my great surprise, a fresh-looking girl of my  own age rushed up to me suddenly, and kissed me without one word of  warning. She was a very pretty girl, pink-cheeked and hazel-eyed:  and as she kissed me, she seized both my hands in hers, and cried  out to me frankly:    
"Why, there you are, Una dear! Cousin Emma telegraphed us what train  you'd arrive by; so I've driven down to meet you. And now, you're  coming up with us this very minute in the pony-carriage."    
"You're Minnie Moore, I suppose?" I said, gazing at her admiringly.  Her sweet, frank smile and apple-blossom cheek somehow inspired me  with confidence.    
She looked back at me quite distressed. Tears rose at once into her  eyes with true Celtic suddenness.    
"Oh, Una," she cried, deeply hurt and drawing back into her shell,  "don't tell me you don't know me! Why, I'm Minnie! Minnie!"    
My heart went out to her at once. I took her hand in mine again.    
"Minnie dear," I said softly, quite remorseful for my mistake, "you  must remember what has happened to me, and not be angry. I've  forgotten everything, even my own past life. I've forgotten that I  ever before set eyes upon you. But, my dear, there's one thing I've  <i>not</i> in a way forgotten; and that is, that I loved you and love you  dearly. And I 'll give you a proof of it. When I started, I knew  none of you; and I told Aunt Emma I wouldn't go among strangers. The  moment I see you, I know you're no stranger, but a very dear cousin.  When I've forgotten <i>myself</i>, how can I remember <i>you</i>? But I'll go up  with you at once. And I'll countermand the room I ordered by  telegram at the Imperial."    
The tears stood fuller in Minnie's eyes than before. She clasped my  hand hard. Her pretty lips trembled.    
"Una darling," she said, "we always were friends, and we always  shall be. If you love me, that's all. You're a darling. I love you."    
I looked at her sweet face, and knew it was true. And oh, I was so  glad to have a new friend--an old friend, already! For somehow, as  always, while the intellectual recollection had faded, the emotion  survived. I felt as if I'd known Minnie Moore for years, though I  never remembered to have seen her in my life till that minute.    
Well, I remained at the Moores' for a week, and felt quite at home  there. They were all very nice, Cousin Willie, and Aunt Emily (she  made me call her aunt; she said I'd always done so), and Minnie, and  all of them. They were really dear people; and blood, after all, is  thicker than water. But I made no haste to push inquiries just at  first. I preferred to feel my way. I wanted to find out what they  knew, if anything, about Berry Pomeroy.    
The first time I ventured to mention the subject to Minnie, she gave  a very queer smile--a smile of maidenly badinage.    
"Well, you remember <i>that</i>, any way," she said, in a teasing little  way, looking down at me and laughing. "I thought you'd remember  that. I must say you enjoyed yourself wonderfully at Berry Pomeroy!"    
"Remember what?" I cried, all eagerness; for I saw she attached some  special importance to the recollection. And yet, it was terrible she  should jest about the clue to my father's murderer!    
Minnie looked arch. When she looked arch, she was charming.    
"Why, I never saw you prettier or more engaging in your life than  you were that day," she said evasively, as if trying to pique me.  "And you flirted so much, too! And everybody admired you so.  Everybody on the grounds... especially one person!"    
I looked up at her in surprise. I was in my own room, seated by the  dressing-table, late at night, when we'd gone up to bed; and Minnie  was beside me, standing up, with her bedroom candle in that pretty  white little hand of hers.    
"What do you mean?" I exclaimed eagerly. "Was it a dance--or a  picnic?"    
"Oh, you know very well," Minnie went on teasingly, "though you  pretend you forget. <i>He</i> was there, don't you know. You must remember  <i>him</i>, if you've forgotten all the rest of your previous life. You say  you remember the appropriate emotions. Well, he was an emotion: at  least, you thought so. It was an Athletic Club Meeting: and Dr. Ivor  was there. He went across on his bicycle."    
I gave a start of surprise. Minnie looked down at me half  maliciously.    
"There, you see," she said archly again, "at Dr. Ivor you change  colour. I told you you'd remember him!"    
I grew pale with astonishment.    
"Minnie dear," I said, holding her hands very tight in my own, "it  wasn't that, I assure you. I've forgotten him, utterly. If ever I  knew a Dr. Ivor, if ever I flirted with him, as you seem to imply,  he's gone clean out of my head. His name stirs no chord--recalls  absolutely nothing. But I want to know about that Athletic Meeting.  Was my poor father there that day? And did he take a set of  photographs?"    
Minnie clapped her hands triumphantly.    
"I <i>knew</i> you remembered!" she cried. "Of course, Cousin Vivian was  there. We drove over in a break. You <i>must</i> remember that. And he took  a whole lot of instantaneous photographs."    
My hand trembled violently in my cousin's. I felt I was now on the  very eve of a great discovery.    
"Minnie," I said, tentatively, "do you think your papa would drive  us over some day and--and show us the place again?"    
"Of course he would, dear," Minnie answered, with a gentle pressure  of my hand. "He'd be only too delighted. Whatever you choose. You  know you were always such a favourite of daddy's."    
I knew nothing of the sort; but I was glad to learn it. I drew  Minnie out a little more about the Athletics and my visit to Berry  Pomeroy. She wouldn't tell me much: she was too illusive and  indefinite: she never could get the notion out of her head, somehow,  that I remembered all about it, and was only pretending to  forgetfulness. But I gathered from what she said, that Dr. Ivor and  I must have flirted a great deal; or, at least, that he must have  paid me a good lot of attention. My father didn't like it, Minnie  said; he thought Dr. Ivor wasn't well enough off to marry me. He was  a distant cousin of ours, of course--everything was always "of  course" with that dear bright Minnie--what, didn't I know that? Oh,  yes, his mother was one of the Moores of Barnstaple, cousin Edward's  people. His name was Courtenay Moore Ivor, you know--though I knew  nothing of the sort. And he was awfully clever. And, oh, so  handsome!    
"Is he at Berry Pomeroy still?" I asked, trembling, thinking this  would be a good person to get information from about the people at  the Athletic Sports.    
"Oh dear, no," Minnie answered, looking hard at me, curiously. "He  was never at Berry Pomeroy. He had a practice at Babbicombe. He's in  Canada now, you know. He went over six months after Cousin Vivian's  death. I think, dear,"--she hesitated,--"he never <i>quite</i> got over  your entirely forgetting him, even if you forgot your whole past  history."    
This was a curious romance to me, that Minnie thus sprang on me--a  romance of my own past life of which I myself knew nothing.    
We sat late talking, and I could see Minnie was very full indeed of  Dr. Ivor. Over and over again she recurred to his name, and always  as though she thought it might rouse some latent chord in my memory.  But nothing came of it. If ever I had cared for Dr. Ivor at all,  that feeling had passed away utterly with the rest of my  experiences.    
When Minnie rose to go, I took her hand once more in mine. As I did  so, I started. Something about it seemed strangely familiar. I  looked at it close with a keen glance. Why, this was curious! It was  Aunt Emma's hand: it was my mother's hand: it was the hand in my  mental Picture: it was the hand of the murderer!    
"It's just like auntie's," I said with an effort, seeing Minnie  noticed my start.    
She looked at it and laughed.    
"The Moore hand," she said gaily. "We all have it, except you. It's  awfully persistent."    
I turned it over in front and examined the palm. At sight of it my  brain reeled. This was surely magic! Minnie Moore's hand, too, was  scarred over with cuts, exactly like Aunt Emma's!"    
"Why, how on earth did you do that?" I cried, thunderstruck at the  discovery.    
But Minnie only laughed again, a bright girlish laugh.    
"Climbing over that beastly wall at The Grange," she said with a  merry look. "Oh, what fun we did have! We climbed it together. We  were dreadful tomboys in those days, dear, you and I: but you were  luckier than I was, and didn't cut yourself with the bottle-glass."    
This was too surprising to be passed over unnoticed. When Minnie was  gone, I lay awake and pondered about it. Had all the Moores got  scars on their hands, I wondered? And how many people, I asked  myself, had cut themselves time and again in climbing over that  barricaded garden-wall of my father's?    
The Moore hand might be hereditary, but not surely the scars. Was  the murderer, then, a Moore, and was that the meaning of Dr.  Marten's warning?
