  Herbert felt a little diffident about accepting his employer's   invitation to dinner. Brought up in the country in comparative  poverty,  he felt afraid that he should show, in some way, his want of   acquaintance with the etiquette of the dining table. But he had a  better  than ordinary education, and, having read diligently whatever  books he  could get hold of, possessed a fund of general information  which enabled  him to converse intelligently. Then his modest  self-possession was of  value to him, and enabled him to acquit himself  very creditably. 
  Julia Godfrey, the merchant's only daughter, was a lively and  animated  girl, a year or two younger than Herbert. She had been the  belle of the  dancing school, and Tom Stanton, among other boys, had  always been proud  to have her for a partner. She, however, had taken  no particular fancy  to Tom, whose evident satisfaction with himself  naturally provoked  criticisms on the part of others. Of this, however,  Tom was unconscious,  and flattered himself that his personal  appearance was strikingly  attractive, and was quite convinced that his  elaborate and gorgeous  neckties must attract admiration. 
  Julia awaited the advent of her father's young guest with interest,  and  her verdict was favorable. He was, to be sure, very plainly  dressed, but  his frank and open face and pleasant expression did not  need fine  clothes to set them off. Julia at once commenced an animated   conversation with our hero. 
  &quot;Weren't you frightened when you saw the robber?&quot; she asked, for  her  father had told her of Herbert's adventure with the burglar. 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;I did not feel afraid.&quot; 
  &quot;How brave you must be?&quot; said Julia, with evident admiration. 
  &quot;There was no need of my being frightened,&quot; said Herbert, modestly.  &quot;I  was expecting him.&quot; 
  &quot;I know I should have been frightened to death,&quot; said Julia,  decidedly. 
  &quot;You are a girl, you know,&quot; said Herbert. &quot;I suppose it is natural  for  girls to be timid.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know but it is, but I am sure it is not natural to all  boys to  be brave.&quot; 
  Herbert smiled. 
  &quot;I was out in the country, one day, walking with Frank Percy,&quot;  proceeded  Julia, &quot;when a big, ugly-looking dog met us. Frank, instead  of standing  by, and defending me, ran away as fast as his feet could  carry him. I  laughed at him so much about it that he doesn't like to  come near me  since that.&quot; 
  &quot;How did you escape?&quot; asked Herbert, with interest. 
  &quot;I saw there was no use in running away, so I patted him on the  head,  and called him 'Poor dog,' though I expected every minute he was  going  to bite me. That calmed him down, and he went off without doing  any  harm.&quot; 
  Herbert found Mrs. Godfrey to be a pleasant, motherly-looking lady,  who  received him kindly. He felt that he should like it very much if  she was  his aunt, instead of Mrs. Stanton, whom he had never seen, and  did not  think he should care about meeting. 
  &quot;What do you think of Tom Stanton?&quot; asked Julia, &quot;Of course, you  know  him&#8212;the other boy in pa's counting-room.&quot; 
  &quot;I am not very well acquainted with him yet,&quot; said Herbert,  evasively,  for he did not care to say anything unfavorable of Tom. &quot;Do  you know  him?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, he used to go to the same dancing school with me last  winter.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you know him better than I do.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't like him much,&quot; said Julia. &quot;He's always thinking of  himself  and his neckties. He always came to dancing school in a  different  necktie; to let us know how many he had, I suppose. Didn't  you notice  his necktie?&quot; 
  &quot;It was pretty large, I thought,&quot; said Herbert, smiling. 
  &quot;Yes, he's fond of wearing large ones.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid you are talking uncharitably, Julia,&quot; said her mother,   mildly. &quot;Girls, you know, are sometimes fond of dress.&quot; 
  So the conversation drifted on to other topics. Julia, at first,   addressed our hero as Mr. Mason, until he requested her to call him   Herbert, a request which she readily complied with. They were soon on   excellent terms, and appeared to be mutually pleased. 
  &quot;Young people,&quot; said Mr. Godfrey, after dinner, &quot;there is to be an   attractive concert at the Academy of Music this evening. I secured  seats  this morning for four. Suppose we all go?&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be delighted, for one, papa,&quot; said Julia. &quot;You will like  to go,  Herbert, won't you?&quot; 
  &quot;Very much,&quot; said our hero. 
  &quot;Then you can escort me, while papa and mamma walk together.&quot; 
  Herbert felt that this arrangement would be very agreeable, so far  as he  was concerned. It was, in fact, adopted, and the four paired off   together, as Julia had suggested, Julia amusing Herbert by her lively   remarks. 
  Entering the hall, they followed the usher to their seats, which  were  eligibly located only a few rows back from the stage. 
  Just behind them sat a party, among whom the new arrivals produced  quite  a sensation. Not to keep the reader in suspense, that party  consisted of  Mr. and Mrs. Stanton, Tom and Maria. There was but slight  acquaintance  between the two families, as Mr. Godfrey's stood higher,  socially, than  Mr. Stanton's. The gentlemen, however, had a bowing  acquaintance, and  the young people had met at dancing school. 
  &quot;Why, there's Mr. Godfrey and his family, Tom,&quot; said Maria, turning   towards her brother. &quot;Who's that boy with them? Julia hasn't got any   brother, has she?&quot; 
  Tom had watched the entrance of the party with lively  dissatisfaction.  That his beggarly cousin should appear in public on  such intimate terms  with Julia Godfrey, to whom he himself had paid  attention, but without  any special encouragement, struck him as  particularly mortifying. 
  &quot;Mr. Godfrey's son!&quot; he said, disdainfully. &quot;That boy is Herbert  Mason.&quot; 
  &quot;Our cousin?&quot; asked Maria, with interest. &quot;Ma, did you hear?&quot; she   whispered, eagerly. &quot;That boy in front of us is Cousin Herbert.&quot; 
  &quot;That boy with the Godfreys?&quot; said Mrs. Stanton, in surprise. 
  &quot;Yes, he's talking with Julia now.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you sure? Who told you?&quot; 
  &quot;Tom.&quot; 
  &quot;Is it true, Tom?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Tom, frowning. 
  &quot;What could have induced the Godfreys to bring him along?&quot; said  Mrs.  Stanton, who was no better pleased than Tom at the social success  of the  poor relation. 
  &quot;He's quite good-looking,&quot; said Maria. 
  &quot;Nonsense,&quot; said her mother, sharply. &quot;He has a very countrified  look.&quot; 
  The news was communicated to Mr. Stanton, who looked with interest  at  his sister's son, whom he had not seen since he was a very young  child.  He fervently wished him back again in Ohio, where he might  conveniently  forget his existence. Here in New York, especially since  an unlucky  chance, as he considered it, had brought him into the same  counting-room  as his son, it would be difficult to avoid taking some  notice of him.  But, so far as pecuniary assistance was concerned, Mr.  Stanton  determined that he would give none, unless it was forced upon  him. Had  he known our hero better, he would have been less alarmed. 
  With all his prejudices, Mr. Stanton could not help confessing that   Herbert was a boy of whom any uncle might be proud. Though plainly   dressed, he did not seem out of place at a fashionable concert,   surrounded by well-dressed people. 
  It must not be supposed that Herbert was left in ignorance of the   vicinity of the only relations he had in the city. 
  &quot;There's Tom Stanton, just behind you, with his father and mother  and  sister,&quot; whispered Julia. 
  Herbert turned his head slightly. He was desirous of seeing what  his  uncle and aunt were like. His uncle met his gaze, and turned   uncomfortably away, appearing not to know him, yet conscious that in  his  affected ignorance he was acting shabbily. Mrs. Stanton did not  flinch,  but bent a cold gaze of scrutiny upon the unwelcome nephew.  Tom looked  supercilious, and elevated his pug nose a trifle. Maria,  only, looked as  if she would like to know her cousin. 
  It was only a hasty glance on Herbert's part, but it brought him to  a  rapid conclusion that he would not claim relationship. If any  advances  were made, they must come from the other side. 
  Tom fidgeted in his seat, watching with ill-concealed vexation the   confidential conversation which appeared to be going on between Julia   and his cousin. 
  &quot;What she can see in that boor, I can't imagine,&quot; he said to  himself. 
  Moreover, though Julia had looked around, she had not deigned any   recognition of himself, and this hurt his pride. He finally determined   to overlook the neglect, and address her, which he could readily do,  as  he sat almost directly behind her. 
  &quot;Good-evening, Miss Julia,&quot; he said, familiarly, bending forward. 
  &quot;Oh, good-evening, Mr. Stanton,&quot; said Julia, coldly, just turning   slightly. &quot;Herbert, isn't that a beautiful song?&quot; 
  &quot;She calls him Herbert,&quot; said Tom, in scornful disgust. &quot;I wonder  if she  knows he is nothing but a beggar?&quot; 
  &quot;How are you enjoying the concert, Miss Julia?&quot; he continued,  resolved  not to take the rebuff. 
  &quot;Very well,&quot; said Julia. &quot;By the way,&quot; she continued, with a sudden   thought, &quot;I believe you are acquainted with Mr. Mason.&quot; 
  Herbert, upon this, bowed pleasantly, but Tom said, in rather a   disagreeable tone, &quot;I know Mr. Mason slightly.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh,&quot; said Julia, arching her eyebrows, &quot;I thought you were both in   papa's counting-room.&quot; 
  &quot;We shall know each other better by and by,&quot; said Herbert, smiling. 
  Tom did not appear to hear this, but tried to keep up the  conversation  with Julia, desiring to have it appear that they were  intimate friends;  but the young lady gave brief replies, and finally,  turning away,  devoted herself once more to Herbert, much to Tom's  disgust. In fact,  what he saw made Tom pass a very unpleasant evening,  and when, on their  return home, Maria suggested that Julia had taken a  fancy to Herbert, he  told her to mind her own business, which Maria  justly considered a piece  of rudeness wholly uncalled for.
