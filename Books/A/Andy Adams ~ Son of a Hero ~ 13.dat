  It was the night of the big wedding in the little town of Dunkirk.   Since early morning, many strangers had, been arriving, and now the   great house of Henry Ellery Dixon&#8212;fat, florid and hated, but the   owner of ships, millions and a beautiful daughter&#8212;was filled with   them. Among his guests were men who represented tremendous corporate   wealth and power&#8212;half a dozen presidents of banks, a dozen steel and   ore men, twice as many kings of lake traffic lines, influential chiefs   of the powerful Lake Carriers' Association. With them there were their   wives and daughters. But with the exception of the minister and the   servants there was not a man or a woman among them who belonged to the   common lake breed of the town of Dunkirk. 
  Not that the people of Dunkirk were either surprised or  disappointed!  The best of them had expected the slight, and would have  resented  anything else, although each had anticipated the affair,  which was to  be the biggest and grandest thing that had ever happened  in their town  so far as the oldest of them could remember. They had  watched with  interest the coming of the guests, and most of them were  willing, if  not a little anxious, to be somewhere near Dunkirk Hill  when the great  and last moment arrived, but they would all be relieved  when  everything was over. They had come to look upon the event that  was to  transpire in the big house that night as something like an  execution.  Certainly the sorrow and sympathy in their hearts would not  have been  greater had such been the case. 
  Miss Isobel was to be married&#8212;that is, she was to pass through the   formality of a marriage, a sort of legal contract, stipulating that   from a certain hour she was to consider herself owned and governed by   a man for whom she possessed no love and who knew that he was not   loved but yet was immensely satisfied with his bargain. From several   view-points everything was satisfactory. The bridegroom-to-be was   securing youth and beauty, Henry Ellery Dixon was gaining the co-   operation of new power and wealth, and his daughter, at the slight   expense of a broken heart, was obeying his wishes to the letter. 
  The people of Dunkirk knew why this was so. Not many years had  passed  since the millionaire's wife had travelled a very short road to  ruin,  and, though Isobel did not proclaim it from the housetops, the   simplest minds in the place realized that her blind obedience was an   atonement for another's sin. 
  For these reasons there had come a real grief into the hearts of  the  people of Dunkirk. In her sweet, unaffected way Isobel had worked   herself into their lives, and her sacrifice now was the sacrifice of   one of their own children. She had grown up among them, with her   laughter, her smiles, and her help when it was needed, and from among   them she had chosen the man whom she loved. 
  During the last hours preceding the wedding the women of Dunkirk   talked of these things. They recalled days that had passed, years   before, when bare-footed, sunburned Jackie McTarr, called &quot;Tarry&quot; for   short, played along the beach with pretty golden-haired Isobel Dixon,   despite the protests and threats of the high-toned mother and father   on the hill. But the business of the master of the house was in   Buffalo, where he remained for weeks at a time, and for this reason   the chumship of a rich man's little girl and a fisherman's son   continued unbroken. 
  The men and women of Dunkirk had watched the courtship that  followed,  and it seemed to them the most beautiful thing that had ever  come  within their sight. 
  When Jack broke away from the fishing fleet to seek his fortune  among  the big steel ships of the lake highways, they confidently  predicted  success for him. One day he returned, mate of a  six-thousand-ton ore  carrier. All Dunkirk rejoiced in a public  celebration in his honour,  and that same day Isobel had met him in  their tryst on the other side  of Dunkirk Hill, and with glistening  eyes told him how proud she was  of the man who was doing all these  things for her. 
  &quot;When I become a captain,&quot; said the young mate, &quot;your father will  not  hate me so.&quot; 
  Isobel had believed him, and, strong in the knowledge of the girl's   great love, the plucky young sailor had won his way until he came into   the command of a ship. Almost that same day there happened on the hill   the scandal which changed all things for Isobel Dixon and the man who   had become Captain John B. McTarr. 
  So, to the people of Dunkirk, the wedding this night was the last   chapter in a living romance which they had all followed from the first   page to the last. In that last chapter Isobel had been bargained for   and sold. They had seen the young captain's final efforts to move the   heart of stone which lay in the breast of the millionaire ship-owner;   they had watched him in his almost frantic attempts to win the girl   from her determination; some of them had even taken a part in the   drama which was being enacted before their eyes; but, in spite of it   all, the tragic end came, and with it the disappearance of Jack   McTarr. Men and women wondered where he was this night as they looked   at the great house aglow with light on the top of Dunkirk Hill. For   weeks the fisher-folk had not heard of him. Some believed that he had   changed his command; others inclined to the rumour that he had given   up the lakes and was now on the ocean; and all of them prayed, deep   down in their souls, that vengeance in full measure would fall upon   the head of Henry Ellery Dixon and the man who was to become his son-   in-law. 
  With Isobel Dixon the struggle against her old love had been a long   and bitter one, but, in a way, she had triumphed, and deep in her   heart she had smothered her passion as a stoker in one of her father's   ships might have banked his fires. Now and then the old feeling would   burst through, and, while at these times her determination would never   weaken, she would think of her absent lover for hours at a time. 
  During the few days preceding the wedding these spells had come to  her  oftener than before, and she was thankful that the young captain  was  not near. But in these same moods she often wished that she knew  where  he was. She pictured him in a hundred different places and the  old  spirit that she was trying to kill groped out for him, searching&#8212;   always searching. Yet she knew that if her lover appeared to her in   person she would send him away again. 
  Still this something that went out from her, this telepathic  message  which she unconsciously directed, was working in a way of  which she  little dreamed. At the end of the thousand-mile highway  which leads to  Duluth it found Captain Jack McTarr, and, seizing upon  him, like a  messenger of life and death, it called for him to return. 
  Three days before the wedding Captain McTarr's ship left Duluth,  and  burned half a hundred tons of coal more than she should before she   drew up in the night off the town of Dunkirk. 
  With the exception of the men of his own crew, no one saw Captain   McTarr when he came ashore in one of the ship's small boats. He landed   on the beach an eighth of a mile below the Dixon home, where a row of   old willows concealed the stretch of white sand over which he and   Isobel had walked a thousand times together. Through these trees he   could see the glow of light on the top of Dunkirk Hill. 
  Swiftly he ran along the beach until he came to a rough seat built   between two trees, from which he could see the windows of Isobel's   room. More times than he could remember he had come to this place, and   had signalled his presence to his sweetheart on the hill. His heart   seemed ready to burst as he stood there now, and he gave a choking sob   or two, as a man sometimes will when alone with a great grief. He knew   the hour of Isobel's marriage, and he pictured her already prepared   for the ceremony. Perhaps the guests were even now assembling in the   great Dixon hall. He pulled out his watch, and saw by the light of a   match that there was still three-quarters of an hour before the   ceremony. 
  Indistinctly the sound of music floated down to him, and as he  heard  it he staggered out beyond the shadow of the willows, softly  crying  Isobel's name. He approached nearer and nearer to the big house  on the  hill. The music came to him plainly now, and he could hear the   laughter of men who were smoking on the veranda overlooking the lake. 
  He crept still nearer, crouching now like a criminal until he could   look almost straight up into Isobel's windows. In that room was all   that he had ever lived for. Isobel had been his guiding star; she had   fired him with ambition; she had made of him what he was. Without   Isobel&#8212;-The captain's fingers came in contact with cold metal in his   pocket. Why not kill himself here? They&#8212;the people in there, Isobel,   all of them&#8212;would hear the shot and would rush out and find him, and   Isobel, he knew, would take him in her arms, would kiss him&#8212;God, but   it was a terrible temptation! He drew the pistol from his pocket. 
  &quot;Isobel! Isobel!&quot; he murmured softly. 
  From the veranda a man's laughter came down to him. It jarred upon   him, and into his head there came the thought that he would like to   kill somebody up there as well as himself. At the last moment why   should he not steal in and destroy the man who was taking his life   from him? If he could only kill them all&#8212;all but Isobel, and carry   her away from him! 
  At the thought his heart seemed to leap up within him like a living   thing just released from chains. He sprang to his feet and turned his   face in the direction of the ship, every nerve in him throbbing with   excitement. He lighted another match and looked at his watch. There   still remained twenty-four minutes. Twenty-four&#8212;twenty-four. He   repeated the words tremblingly, and then, turning down the hill, he   ran like a deer, past the seat among the willows and up the hard   water-run of the beach to the small boat. 
  &quot;Quick, to the ship!&quot; he panted. He caught the boat by the prow and   shoved it out into the water, the sailors running in ankle-deep to   catch him. In the glow of the boat-lantern they saw his face, and   rowed with the fervour of men who knew that minutes were precious. 
  Half a dozen times in the short trip to the ship Captain McTarr  looked  at his watch, but only once did he speak to the men, and then  it was  to urge them to make greater speed. To him the time seemed  slipping  away with fearful rapidity. There were only nineteen minutes  left&#8212;now  eighteen&#8212;seventeen&#8212;fifteen! 
  In his excitement he stood up in the boat and shouted the name of  his  first officer, and by the time he shot alongside the steel  freighter a  score of astonished men were lining the rail. 
  &quot;Falkner!&quot; he called. &quot;Jim! Your hands!&quot; 
  He stretched himself up, and the stalwart first mate leaned over  and  hoisted him as easily as an ordinary man would have lifted a  child.  The men knew why they had raced day and night from the  northern-most  sea, and most of them stared fixedly through the  darkness shoreward,  confident that their captain had done something  for which he was being  pursued. 
  Their thoughts were interrupted by Captain McTarr. &quot;Men, I want a   dozen volunteers to go back with me and stop that marriage!&quot; he cried   pointing toward Dunkirk Hill. &quot;We've got ten minutes. Who'll go?&quot; 
  In an instant several were running to the midship davits, calling  for  others to follow, and half the crew were soon crowded about the  falls.  &quot;A dozen!&quot; shouted a voice disdainfully. &quot;A dozen! We'll all  go!&quot; 
  A sailor launched himself down into the small boat beside the   freighter, and others came after him as fast as they could slip safely   over the rail. With a splash the midship boat dropped into the water,   and an instant later the third boat went down on the other side of the   ship. 
  Captain McTarr's boat got away first, and started for the shore  with  four men pulling at the oars. The second fell close in its wake,  and a  little later the third shot around the freighter's bow, loaded  to the  gunwales with excited, eager men. Three-quarters of the crew  were  following their captain. 
  For the first time in weeks the heart of Isobel's lover thrilled  with  hope. He had not stopped to consider the consequences of what he  was  doing; he only knew that he would stop the wedding, that he would  see  Isobel and save her from the man who had taken her from him&#8212;if he   reached the Dixon home in time. He gave no thought as to what would be   the outcome for the men of his crew. They were backing him, and that   was the most satisfying thing that could happen just then. 
  As the first boat scraped in the sand of the beach, Captain McTarr   sprang out and started on a slow run toward Dunkirk Hill with six or   eight men close at his heels. Jim Falkner soon overtook him,   accompanied by others, and before they were half-way up the slope the   men of the third boat were following swiftly on their trail. 
  As the little crowd of men, led by the big mate and the captain,  came  nearer the Dixon home, they could see that the verandas were  deserted,  and the thought that they were too late sent Captain McTarr  ahead like  a shot, with Jim Falkner close at his side. Together the  two men  rushed up the front steps of the house, a dozen rough, excited  fellows  at their heels. The big doors were open, and through them now  came the  soft strains of the wedding march. 
  With a shout to those behind him, McTarr launched himself into the   Dixon hall, and led a half of his breathless men into the great room   where a hundred guests were assembled. &quot;Isobel!&quot; he cried. &quot;Isobel!   Isobel!&quot; 
  He stared about him, almost blinded by the glare of light, his men   crowding behind him like wolves ready to spring forward at his   bidding. The orchestra stopped playing. Startled men and women sat for   the moment as if transfixed by the sudden apparition of the wild-   looking crowd, and before they had recovered from their astonishment   Falkner came in, accompanied by half a dozen men from the third boat. 
  &quot;She's out there!&quot; he said quietly, pulling the captain toward the   hall. &quot;Hurry with your business. I'll keep these people back!&quot; 
  McTarr went out, and at the head of the stairs he saw Isobel  looking  down upon the scene below, her face white and startled. Beside  her was  the man whom he had almost determined to kill. He bounded up  toward  them, three steps at a time, and when the girl saw him she  uttered a  piercing cry which rose above the voices of men and the  frightened  screams of women in the drawing-room. The man beside her  advanced a  little to intercept the other, and when they came together  they went  down in a close smothering grip at the girl's feet. 
  When McTarr disentangled himself a few moments later the other   remained in a limp heap. Jim Falkner, who saw it from below, was   afraid that the worst had happened. 
  The captain hurried to the girl, his face white and a little  bloody.  &quot;Isobel, you must come with me!&quot; he said deliberately. He  seemed faint  and swayed a little as he stretched out an arm for her.  &quot;You must  come!&quot; 
  The girl made no resistance as he led her down the stair. As if in  a  stupor, she followed him to the open door. Behind them were now the   sounds of struggling men and of rough voices filled with exhortation   and command. But Isobel was unconscious of it all. She only realized   that her lover was with her, and that he had come at a moment when it   seemed as though all possible happiness in her whole life was slipping   away from her. For a moment she forgot. She clung to his hand, ran   when he told her to, and murmured his name again and again,   incoherently, joyfully. 
  Still running, they came down to the edge of the lake. Then, when  she  saw the lights of the ship, the old sense of duty returned to her.  It  came like a shock, weakening her, and she dragged back, falling  upon  her knees in the sand. &quot;Jack! Jack! What have you made me do?&quot;  she  sobbed. &quot;I can't go with you&#8212;I can't&#8212;I can't!&quot; 
  Captain McTarr kneeled beside her and caught her in his arms,  pressing  his face close to her own, whispering his passionate  entreaties. He  knew that there was no time to lose. Back on the hill  the sailors were  slowly retreating, and he could hear their loud  voices, suddenly  punctuated by a number of pistol-shots. At the sound  of the reports,  Isobel gave a cry of alarm and struggled to free  herself from her  lover's embrace. &quot;Go, Jack! Please go!&quot; she pleaded.  &quot;I can't go with  you. I won't go!&quot; 
  She thrust out her hands forcefully, but the captain only held her   closer. Suddenly he lifted her from the ground and ran toward the   boats with her in his arms. His determination robbed the girl of her   strength, and when at last he placed her gently in one of the boats he   thought by her silence that she had surrendered to him. But when he   brought one of the lanterns and looked down into her eyes, his nerves   tingling with the joy of possessing her, he saw something in them   which startled him. He might have thought that the girl despised him.   He struggled to speak, but his tongue seemed tied. The next moment two   of the sailors hurried up, bringing the little Dunkirk preacher   between them. 
  &quot;Jack 'n' me, we've collared the preacher, Cap'n,&quot; said one of the   men. &quot;We figgered as 'ow he might be wanted, so we brung him!&quot; 
  &quot;Let him go!&quot; commanded the captain. He held out his hand to the   little man, who gripped it with an enthusiasm which the other did not   guess the meaning of. &quot;They didn't know,&quot; he explained. &quot;I didn't   intend that they should do it, Mr. Wilfred.&quot; 
  One of the sailors expressed his astonishment audibly. 
  Isobel sprang to her feet with a little cry, and involuntarily the   minister's friendly grip relaxed. Deep accusation shone in the girl's   eyes as she flashed them at Captain McTarr. &quot;Then you meant to take me   out there&#8212;alone?&quot; she said, in a low voice. 
  But the little minister heard her, and in an instant he had jumped   into the boat and was at her side. &quot;No, he didn't mean that!&quot; he   cried, looking at the captain sharply. &quot;Sit down, Isobel. I'm going   with you!&quot; 
  Captain McTarr's gratitude filled him with a desire to embrace Mr.   Wilfred, who had cleverly turned an embarrassing situation, but almost   immediately the first of the retreating sailors came running along the   edge of the lake, and the boat was soon filled with noisy, hard-   breathing men. 
  As it pulled out for the ship, Jim Falkner's voice could be heard  on  shore commanding his men to make a dash for the second and third   boats. The rowers in the first boat rested on their oars and looked   expectantly to see what would happen, but those who had expected   excitement were disappointed. 
  The crowd of black-frocked, white-shirted men who had come in  pursuit  hesitated, then stopped, as Falkner and the second officer  fired half  a dozen shots from their revolvers into the air. A  triumphant shout  rose from the sailors, but Captain McTarr was silent.  Never had Isobel  seemed so far from him as at the present moment, and  until he reached  the side of the ship he maintained a silence which  began to cool the  enthusiasm of the crew. 
  He was the first to climb aboard, and as he lifted the girl up over   the rail he held her so close that he could feel her breath on his   cheek. &quot;Forgive me, Isobel&#8212;forgive me if I am doing wrong,&quot; he   whispered. 
  He led her across the deck into the officer's parlour, and there  the  girl flung herself in a chair beside the cabin-table and buried  her  face in her arms. 
  &quot;Isobel&#8212;if I had known&#8212;&quot; said the man gently, his voice  trembling.  &quot;If I had known, perhaps I wouldn't have returned.&quot; He  looked tenderly  upon the sobbing girl, his face tense with suffering.  &quot;At the last  moment something seemed to call me to you, Isobel,  something I  couldn't resist. I kept my reason until I went ashore and  looked up at  your windows from the old seat under the willows; then&#8212;&quot; 
  He leaned over until his lips touched the girl's silken hair. For  many  minutes he let them rest there, and Isobel made no effort to push  him  away. He began whispering of his love again, of the hope that had   risen and fallen, and of what she meant to him, when the telephone on   the end of the table rang interruptingly. He reached out and pulled   the receiver to him. It was Falkner at the other end. 
  &quot;They're getting a big freighter under weigh in the harbour,&quot; he   called. &quot;I think it's one of the old man's ships!&quot; 
  McTarr answered quietly: &quot;That looks like&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Hell!&quot; came the response, firmly and convincingly. 
  McTarr turned toward the girl. She had raised her head and was  looking  at him, white-faced, questioning. &quot;They're pursuing us!&quot; he  said. 
  &quot;What's that?&quot; came the first officer's voice. 
  &quot;Wait a moment, Jim,&quot; called the captain. 
  He placed his hand over the transmitter. &quot;They're pursuing us,   Isobel,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Quick, dear, say that you will marry me&#8212;that   you will let Mr. Wilfred&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I can't say that, Jack. I can't say it!&quot; 
  Captain McTarr faced the telephone. &quot;Let her go, Mr. Falkner,&quot; he   commanded. &quot;Head up the lakes&#8212;and blow her up if you see we're not   winning!&quot; 
  He hung up the receiver with a bang. When he looked at the girl  again  it was with a consciousness that everything he possessed was at  stake.  Something in his face, an unnatural flush gathering in either  cheek, a  daring&#8212;even menacing&#8212;glitter in his eyes told the girl a  little of  what was in his mind. 
  &quot;You told me once that you despised cowards, Isobel,&quot; he said.   &quot;Wouldn't I be a coward if I gave you up now? I'm going to fight for   you to the end; I'm placing my position and my liberty in the balance,   and, if it comes to the point, I'll risk my life. Your conception of   honour, your determination to make restitution for another by the   sacrifice of yourself, makes you more priceless than ever to me. I   don't know what I'm going to do. I have no plans. But as long as we've   got a ton of coal in our bunkers and a mile of clear sea ahead I give   you my word of honour we strive to win!&quot; 
  The captain gathered enthusiasm as he spoke. He took both of  Isobel's  hands in his own, and no anger or reproach shone in the  tearful eyes  that looked up into his. &quot;It will be a splendid race,  dear,&quot; he  continued, his voice vibrating with partly suppressed  excitement. &quot;It  will be a magnificent race! Listen!&quot; 
  From under their feet came the dull trembling throb of the  freighter's  engines. &quot;Jim's getting us under weigh!&quot; he murmured.  &quot;They're all  with me&#8212;Falkner, the ship and the crew. There's only  your father  against&#8212;and you! I ought to win!&quot; He bent over and kissed  the girl,  and then walked quickly out, closing the door behind him. 
  Falkner was watching for him. He shouted from the freighter's  bridge,  and as the captain came up he saw a little group of men  standing under  the pilot-house. Their arms and shoulders were naked  and from the arm-  pits down they wore woollen shirts. They were  long-armed, sinewy men,  with faces burned brick-red by stoke-hole  fires. There was one  exception, and that was Robinson, the second  engineer. The men were  silent as McTarr passed them, for sullenness  comes naturally and  without meaning to men who spend a third of their  lives in the blazing  bowels of a ship. 
  &quot;We'll need the second shift,&quot; explained Falkner. &quot;We fed our  furnaces  sixty times an hour coming down; we'll feed each of the  twelve every  fifty seconds going up. It'll take six men.&quot; 
  He followed the captain to the end of the bridge, and the two  looked  back at Dunkirk. The pursuing ship was already well out,  gathering  speed slowly, her lights slipping out into the night at  right angles  to Captain McTarr's trust ship, then heading on as the  vessel came  into the lake. 
  Jim Falkner, upon whom the possibilities of the whole affair were   steadily growing, had sent instructions down into the engine-room, but   now his fingers set other gongs clanging with greater and more   thrilling import. The wheelman looked down at the second in command   with the excitement of battle shining in his eyes. A sudden thrill   passed through the captain as he saw his mate's fingers playing on the   signal-board, and Falkner himself allowed his voice to quiver in a   subdued way as he turned and asked for instructions. 
  But McTarr had thrown aside the dignity of his position as master  of  an eight-thousand-ton freighter. An hour had changed the men about  him  from hirelings into friends, even to the men of the galley and the   furnace-rooms; and upon them now depended everything that he   possessed. 
  So he held up his hand to the wheelman, and said: &quot;Joe, it's all up  to  you. I've got no instructions to give. I want to lose that ship  behind  as quickly as possible. If we can do that we'll shift our  course and  make Buffalo; if we can't do it&#8212;well, there isn't a  wheelman on the  lakes that can play a better game than you!&quot; 
  He turned with Falkner and descended the pilot-house stair, and the   two headed the file of waiting men into the engine-room corridor. In   the furnace-pits the signals of the first officer had resulted in a   tumbling of fire that was rapidly growing into a deafening roar. Four   men, naked to the waist and grimacing in the heat like black ghouls   through their coating of coal-dust, were working like fiends in their   endeavours to feed the twelve furnaces. In an instant the second and   third shifts plunged into the glare of the pit, and the noise of the   freighter's engines was drowned in the booming of the charges which   followed. McTarr shouted encouragement from the edge of the furnace-   room, and then returned to the deck, followed by the mate. 
  Scarcely were their ears free from the booming of the fires than  they  heard the screeching of the whistle on the pursuing vessel. As  the  blasts continued, Captain McTarr ran into the forward deck and  mounted  the pilot-house stair three steps behind him. 
  &quot;Any lights?&quot; he cried. 
  &quot;Plenty of them,&quot; replied the wheelman. &quot;But those two&#8212;out  there&#8212;are  coming up fast!&quot; He spoke slowly and with emphasis, and  pointed to  starboard of the Dunkirk ship. 
  A mile in the offing McTarr discerned a pair of lights keeping pace   with the trust ship, and even as he looked other lights flared up   beside them and the strange vessel changed her course until they   seemed to group themselves in a few square feet of space. 
  In Falkner's eyes there was undisguised alarm, expressed in a curse  as  a rocket went sputtering up into the blackness of the night from  the  deck of the pursuing freighter. 
  &quot;A distress-signal, my God!&quot; he shouted. 
  The words had barely left his lips when a second rocket shot into  the  air, and in an instant there came a series of signals from a medoc   whistle on the third ship. McTarr grinned into Falkner's startled   face, then turned down the stair and hastened to the cabin in which he   had left Isobel. 
  As he opened the door he was greeted by the little Dunkirk  minister.  Isobel was standing, her face flushed and her cheeks wet  with tears.  &quot;I want you to come with me, Isobel,&quot; said the captain,  approaching  the girl and taking her by the hand. &quot;Will you&#8212;please?&quot; 
  For a moment the girl hesitated. Then she allowed her lover to lead   her out upon the deck. The pursuing ship had loomed up clear of the   coast lights now, and Captain McTarr pointed her out as a third rocket   streaked the sky with a ribbon of fire. &quot;Your father is sending up   distress signals to a revenue cutter out there!&quot; he explained, guiding   her eyes to the rim of lights bearing down upon them. &quot;Those rockets   are asking for help. It looks bad for me, doesn't it?&quot; 
  Unconsciously the girl allowed a little cry to escape her lips.   Captain McTarr watched her silently as she leaned over the rail. For   several minutes they stood without speaking, and during that time the   Dunkirk ship dropped back until her lights seemed to mingle with those   of the cruiser. &quot;We're beating them,&quot; said Isobel, turning to him at   last. &quot;I believe&#8212;&quot; 
  She caught herself as the captain came up and put his arms around  her,  firmly, gently, as he had done many times before. The girl was  very  white, but McTarr could still read the firmness in her eyes,  which  told him that the little slip of her tongue was unmeant.  Suddenly  there came the thunder of one of the cruiser's guns, and the  man's  arms tightened so fiercely that the ship-owner's daughter cried  out in  pain. 
  &quot;We were beating them,&quot; he said, his voice trembling with a passion   which he vainly attempted to conceal. &quot;It's a coward's trick&#8212;I mean,   it's unfair, to set a warship after us. I've got to break with the   Government now!&quot; 
  He released the girl as running footsteps sounded behind them. It  was  Falkner, his eyes still filled with the light of battle, his face   eagerly questioning. &quot;Does that make any difference?&quot; he cried. 
  &quot;No!&quot; thundered McTarr. &quot;Tell Joe to get into Canadian waters as  soon  as he can.&quot; 
  As his first officer ran back the captain caught Isobel's hands  firmly  in his own again. &quot;It's war!&quot; he almost shouted at her. &quot;It's  war, and  you're going to see me fight it through. I'm going to show  you what  men will do because they know I'm right. Did you see old Jim?  God! but  he's true&#8212;they're all true!&quot; 
  He hurried the girl toward the engine-room companion. The two ships   behind had separated again, and the cutter, ablaze with light, was   forging swiftly ahead of the Dunkirk vessel. A half of her broadside   was visible as she edged out into the lake in her design to cross the   fleeing ship's beam, and as Isobel and the captain paused for a moment   to look at her there came a vivid flash of fire from her bow and the   report of a second gun. 
  With a word of caution to the girl, McTarr climbed down the stair,  and  Isobel followed him. In an instant she was hurried into the chaos  of  the ship's vitals, where five hundred tons of iron and steel were   groaning and crashing, and where Muldoon, the first engineer, and   Robinson, the second, were sweating and swearing, and exhorting the   greasy helpers around them. 
  As she looked into this network of fighting machinery a glow came  into  the girl's face, and her eyes flashed with a little of the fire  that  was in Captain McTarr's. For an instant Muldoon's eyes gleamed  white  at her from out of his black countenance, but that lightning  flash of  attention was all that he gave her or the captain. Isobel  felt a  sudden thrill pass through her as she watched these men, and,   forgetful of the significance of it all, she betrayed her admiration   as she looked at the captain. 
  Suddenly a gong clanged near Muldoon's head, and one of the  engineer's  naked arms shot out and grasped a lever. In that instant he  sent an  inquiring glance at Captain McTarr, and the master of the ship  hurried  to his side. 
  &quot;He wants more!&quot; shouted Muldoon. He pointed a black finger at the   steam-gauge, where the little indicator-hand was hovering restlessly   over a figure which gave warning that the ship had reached her maximum   steam capacity. &quot;He wants more! Shall I&#8212;&quot; 
  Captain McTarr nodded his head and thumbed a line ten pounds ahead. 
  When he turned he found Isobel had come up close behind him. Her  face  was flushed a deeper red. There was excitement in her eyes, a  glowing,  thrilling look which made McTarr's heart leap within him. She  looked  inquiringly at him, questioning him with silent lips. 
  &quot;We're ready to blow up,&quot; he cried in her ear. &quot;Are you afraid?&quot;  Then  he led her into the furnace-room corridor and swung back a steel  door.  It was as if a flood of fire had rolled into the girl's face.  She drew  back, gasping for breath, and covered her face with her  hands. When  she looked again McTarr was down in the pit, and she  followed him.  When he took her out a minute later she seemed to have a  vision of a  bursting inferno of flame and heat. The men, the grim  faces, the  charging of roaring fires and the swinging of furnace doors  had been  only indistinct details in a dazzling picture that filled her  with  terror. 
  McTarr saw that she was trembling, and he put an arm around her as   they returned to the companion. Before they had ascended it the second   engineer rushed out of the engine-room door and intercepted them.   &quot;We've gone twelve pounds beyond the limit!&quot; he almost shrieked.   &quot;They're still calling for more! We can't give it! We can't give it!&quot;   His voice was filled with emphatic warning. 
  McTarr hurried up the companion, half carrying the girl with him.   &quot;I'll see what's the matter, Robinson!&quot; he called back. 
  There was alarm in his voice, and unconsciously Isobel clung  tightly  to his hand as they came on deck. Even she could understand  now what  those signals coming down into the engine-room had meant. The  warship  was rapidly overtaking the freighter. She could easily  distinguish men  working about the cruiser's forward deck-gun, and as  she looked it  spouted out a tongue of flame, and the report came in an  ugly, jarring  sound. &quot;That was a loaded gun,&quot; said McTarr. &quot;I say,  Isobel, it looks  bad for me, doesn't it?&quot; 
  He repeated the question of a few minutes before with a little  laugh  which made Isobel shudder. &quot;They can't hurt you, can they,  Jack?&quot; she  whispered, coming very close. 
  &quot;No&#8212;not exactly hurt,&quot; said the man. &quot;That shot fired across our  bow  means they'll give me three minutes in which to heave to. If I  comply,  they'll take me back to Dunkirk, where I'll probably receive a   sentence for abduction and a fine for breaking the laws of navigation.   If I don't heave to&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;If you don't, Jack&#8212;&quot; urged the girl. 
  &quot;Well, if I don't they'll send a solid shot through me somewhere.  Then  I'll be treated as something of a pirate, and will probably spend  a  few years in prison.&quot; 
  He did not see the look of terror that came into the girl's  blanched  face, for Jim Falkner had come back into the lantern-glow of  the  stern, and the two men looked into each other's faces with grim   understanding. The first officer held an open watch in his hand and   McTarr pulled out his own. &quot;There's two minutes and ten seconds,&quot; he   said. He spoke to the mate, but Isobel Dixon caught the meaning of his   words, and her two hands tightened in a convulsive clasp about the   captain's arm. 
  McTarr turned from Jim Falkner and put his arms around her. &quot;My  fate  rests with you now, Isobel,&quot; he said, so low that the first  officer  could not hear him. &quot;You can save me, even from the charge of   abduction; but if I keep up the fight for two minutes longer&#8212;and I   will unless you do save me&#8212;I shall be ruined!&quot; 
  Falkner saw the girl throw her arms around McTarr's shoulders, and  he  turned away. Twenty seconds later the captain shot to the  engine-room  companion and disappeared down it in a single leap. 
  &quot;Muldoon!&quot; he roared. &quot;Muldoon! Muldoon!&quot; He rushed to the door of  the  engine-room, shouting the engineer's name above the crash of   machinery. &quot;Muldoon, cut 'er down!&quot; he commanded. &quot;Cut 'er down like   lightning!&quot; 
  He saw the engineer's arm shoot out, heard the roar of steam and  the  throbbing, metallic coughing of retarded engines, then sprang up  the  companion and called to the mate. 
  &quot;Where's Mr. Wilfred?&quot; he cried. 
  &quot;In the cabin,&quot; replied the first officer, and McTarr turned and   caught Isobel's hand in his own, his face shining with joy in the   lantern-light. 
  &quot;He's in the cabin, Isobel,&quot; he repeated. He caught the mate by the   arm as he hurried forward with the girl. &quot;We'll want you for a few   minutes in the cabin, Jim&#8212;if you'll be so kind!&quot; 
  A few minutes later, as the United States cutter ran alongside, Mr.   and Mrs. Jack McTarr came hand in hand from the parlour cabin of the   trust ship, prepared to explain matters to the captain of the cruiser.
