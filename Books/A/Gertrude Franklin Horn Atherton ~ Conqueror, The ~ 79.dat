Hamilton laid down a copy of Freneau's <i>Gazette</i>, whose editorial  columns were devoted, as usual, to persuading the people of the United  States that they were miserable, and that they owed their misery to the  Secretary of the Treasury. It also contained a shameful assault upon the  President. As he lifted another paper from the pile on his library  table, his eyes fell on the following address to himself:--    <blockquote>
 O votary of despotism! O abettor of Carthaginian faith! Blush! Can   you for a moment suppose that the hearts of the yeomanry of America   are becoming chilled and insensible to the feelings of insulted   humanity like your own? Can you think that gratitude, the most   endearing disposition of the human heart, is to be argued away by   your dry sophistry? Do you suppose the people of the United States   prudently thumb over Vattel and Pufendorf to ascertain the sum and   substance of their obligations to their generous brethren, the   French? No! no! Each individual will lay his hand on his heart and   find the amount there. He will find that manly glow, both of   gratitude and love, which animated his breast when assisted by this   generous people in establishing his own liberty and shaking off the   yoke of British despotism!</blockquote>    
In the <i>Aurora</i> he was denounced as the foe of France and the friend of  Great Britain and Spain, the high priest of tyranny, the bitterest enemy  of the immortal French trio, Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite; the subtle  and Machiavellian adviser of Washington, who, relieved of this  pernicious influence, would acknowledge the debts of gratitude and  follow the will of the American people.    
"Are they mad?" he thought, flinging the entire pile into the  waste-basket. "Or are they merely so eager for power and our ruin that  they are indifferent to the fact that the Administration, and the  foundations upon which it stands, never has needed the support of the  people more than now? Can only the party in power afford to be  patriotic? What a spectacle is this, that I, an alien born, am wearing  out my life and sacrificing my character, to save from themselves a  people who pant for my ruin! Has the game been worth the candle? Debt,  my family crowded into a house not half large enough to hold them, my  health almost gone, my reputation, in spite of repeated vindications,  undermined by daily assault--for the fools of the world believe what  they are told, and I cannot compromise my dignity by replying to such  attacks as these; above all, a sickening and constant disgust for life  and human nature! <i>Is</i> the game worth the candle? Had I remained at the  bar, I should have given my family abundance by now; with only the kind  and quantity of enemies that stimulate. It is only politics that rouse  the hellish depths in the human heart. It is true that I have saved the  country, made it prosperous, happy, and honoured. But what guaranty have  I that this state will last beyond the administration of Washington?  With the Republicans in power the whole edifice may be swept away, the  country in a worse plight than before, and the author of its brief  prosperity forgotten with his works. I shall have lived in vain, and  leave my sons to be educated, my family to be supported, by my  father-in-law."    
He was in no mood to see the reverse side of the picture; and indeed his  cares were so many and overwhelming at this time that it is little  wonder he believed he had lost for ever the gay buoyancy of his spirits.  In addition to the predominating trials, financial matters were  demanding all the leisure he should have given to rest, heavy failures  in England having seriously affected the money concerns of the United  States; and the rebellions in the West against the Excise Law were  sounding a new alarm. Moreover, his constant efforts to obtain Duer's  release were unavailing; he could get no word of Lafayette; and the last  packet had brought a rumour of the murder of Gouverneur Morris by the  mob. Altogether, he may be excused for forgetting that he was still the  most dazzling figure in America, in the full tide of actual success, and  an object of terrified hatred to a powerful ring who could reach their  zenith over his political corpse, and by no other means whatever.    
He picked up his hat, and went forth reluctantly to a Cabinet meeting.  It was early, and he saw Washington for a few moments alone in the  library. The President was in a no more cheerful or amiable frame of  mind than himself. His responsibilities in this terrible crisis wore on  his spirits and temper; and the daily fear that his Secretaries would  come to blows,--for Jefferson was in the worst humour of the  quintette,--to say nothing of the assaults of the press, made him openly  regret the hour he was persuaded into the Executive Chair. But his  entire absence of party spirit, despite his secret sympathy with every  measure of Hamilton's, his attitude of stern neutrality, never emerged  more triumphantly from any trial of his public career; nor did he ever  exhibit the magnanimity of his character more strikingly than in his  undisturbed affection for Hamilton, while daily twitted with being the  tool of his "scheming and ambitious Secretary."    
Hamilton saw a copy of Freneau's <i>Gazette</i> in the waste-basket, but by  common consent they ignored the subjects which would be unavoidable in a  few moments, and spoke of the stifling heat, of the unhealthy state of  Philadelphia, the menace of the San Domingo refugees pouring into the  city, of the piles of putrid coffee and hides on the wharves at the foot  of Mulberry Street, and of the carcasses of rotting hogs and horses  which lay everywhere.    
"Thank Heaven, we can get our women and children out of it," said the  President. "And unless we can finish this business in another week, I  shall take the Government to the country. I suppose we are entitled to  escape with our lives, if they leave us nothing else."    
They entered the Council Chamber and found the others in their  accustomed seats. Jefferson's brow was corrugated, his weak and mincing  mouth pressed out of shape. He had just finished reading the last of  Hamilton's "No Jacobin" papers, published that morning, in which Genet's  abominable breaches of decorum, violation of treaties, and deliberate  insults to the Executive--and through him to the American people--had  been set forth in so clear pointed and dispassionate a manner, that no  thinking Republican who read could fail to be convinced of the  falseness of his position in supporting this impudent and ridiculous  Frenchman. Furthermore, the Secretary of State had been forced, through  the exigencies of his position, to sign despatch after despatch, letter  after letter, in violation of his private sympathies. He was feeling not  only as angry as a cornered bull, but extremely virtuous. He hated what  he firmly believed to be the cold and selfish policy of the  Administration, as he hated every other policy it had executed; and the  knowledge that he had sacrificed his personal feelings to save his  country from discord, made him feel a far better man than the Secretary  of the Treasury, who had a diabolical talent for getting his own way. He  had some reason to be pleased with his conduct, and with his share in  contributing to a series of measures which later on won for the Cabinet  at that crucial period the encomiums of history; and when time had  abated the fevers, Hamilton would have been the first to acknowledge  that Jefferson not only was the brake which the Administration needed at  that time, but that, owing to his popularity with the French and the  masses of the United States, he reduced the danger of a popular  uprising.    
As Hamilton took his seat this morning, however, the blood was in his  head, and he and Jefferson exchanged a glance of sullen hate which made  Washington extend his long arms at once. All went well until the  President, with a premonitory sigh, introduced the dynamic name, Genet.  Hamilton forgot his debility, and was all mind, alert and energetic.  Jefferson, who had come to hate Genet as an intolerable nuisance, would  have been the first at another moment to counsel the demand for recall  which he knew was now inevitable, but he was in too bad a humour to-day  to concur in any measure agreeable to Hamilton.    
The latter had replied promptly to Washington's remark that the time had  come to take definite action with regard to the light-headed Frenchman,  who continued to fit out and despatch privateers, and was convulsing the  country generally.    
"Pray send him home, bag and baggage, sir. He is not entitled to the  dignity or consideration of the usual formalities. Moreover, he is the  trigger of the United States so long as he remains at liberty in it. I  estimate that there is a new Jacobin club formed daily. At any moment he  may do something which will drive these fools, under their red caps and  cockades, mad with admiration."    
Jefferson brought his brows down to the root of his nose. "'Fools' is  not the word for an honest enthusiasm for liberty, sir. I regret the  present excitement--its manifestations at this moment--as much as  anyone--"    
"Indeed? I am amazed. Who, then, is responsible for them?"    
"Not I, sir."    
"Oh, let us have no more hypocrisy, at all events," said Hamilton,  contemptuously. He had his wrath under control, but he suddenly  determined to force the climax. "If you had employed your secret pen to  better purpose, or not employed it at all, there would not be a Jacobin  club in the country; this ridiculous Frenchman, unencouraged by your  private sympathy, by your assurances of my inability to withhold the  residue of the debt, would have calmed down long since. I accuse you  here, deliberately and publicly, instead of writing private letters to  the public, both because I have not your commanding talent for patient  and devious ways, and because I wish you to declare, unequivocally,  whether or not you purpose to continue this policy of obstruction. Time  presses. We must act at once with regard to this Frenchman. Reserve  subterfuge for some more opportune time, and let us know what you intend  to do."    
Jefferson looked with appeal at Washington, who usually interposed when  his Secretaries arrived at personalities. But Washington, although his  face was as immobile as stone, was so sick with anger and disgust over  the whole situation, at what appeared to be the loss of the popular  faith in himself, and the ridicule and abuse which had filled the  columns of Freneau's paper that morning, that it was a relief to him to  hear Hamilton explode.    
"I repudiate every word you have said, sir," growled Jefferson. "More I  will not say. As to Citizen Genet, with whom I have never had a word of  private intercourse--" Here, even Washington lifted his head, and  Hamilton laughed outright. Jefferson continued, determined upon  martyrdom rather than rouse the terrible passions opposite: "As to  Citizen Genet, if the Cabinet agree that it is best he leave this  country. I shall demand that his recall be requested in the regular  manner, in accordance with every principle of international courtesy. He  may be imprudent, intoxicated with the glorious wine of liberty, but he  is a Frenchman, a distinguished citizen of the great country that came  so nobly to our rescue, and I protest against the base ingratitude which  would fling insults in the teeth of an unfortunate people."    
Hamilton threw back his head impatiently, and drummed with his fingers  on the table. "The primary motive of France for the assistance she gave  us was, obviously, to enfeeble a hated and powerful rival. A second  motive was to extend her relations of commerce in the new world, and to  acquire additional security for her possessions there, by forming a  connection with this country when detached from Great Britain. To  ascribe to her any other motives, to suppose that she was actuated by  friendship toward us, is to be ignorant of the springs of action which  invariably regulate the cabinets of princes. A despotic court aid a  popular revolution through sympathy with its principles! For the matter  of that, if you insist upon American statesmen being sentimental fools,  the class that assisted us has been murdered by the rabble, which I  refuse to recognize as France. And if it be your object to reduce this  country to a similar position that you may climb over maddened brains to  power--"    
"Hear!" roared Jefferson, justly indignant. "I? Never a man loved peace  as I do. My life has been hell since you have forced me into daily  conflict, when, God knows, I perish with desire for the peace of my  homely life in Virginia. Power! I scorn it, sir. I leave that to  restless upstarts like yourself--"    
He stopped, choking. Hamilton laughed contemptuously. "You are at work  with your pen day and night, strengthening your misnamed party, and  preparing the way by which you can lift yourself to a position where you  can undo all that the party you hate, because it is composed of  gentlemen, has accomplished for the honour and prosperity of your  country. You are perfectly well aware that Genet was sent here to stir  up a civil war, and embroil us with Europe at the same time, and you  have secretly sympathized with and encouraged him. I cannot make up my  mind whether you are a villain, or merely the victim of a sublimated and  paradoxical imagination. But in either case, I wish to be placed on  record as asserting that you are the worst enemy the United States is  cursed with to-day."    
This was too much for Jefferson, who had convinced himself that he was a  high-minded and self-sacrificing statesman, stooping to devious ways for  the common good. He forgot his physical fear, and shouted, pounding the  table with his fist:--    
"How dare you, sir? How dare you? It is you who are ruining, corrupting,  and dishonouring this unhappy country, with your Banks, your devilish  methods to cement the aristocracy, your abominable Excise Law--"    
"Oh, but you have counteracted that so effectively! I was coming to that  point. I conceived a measure by which to meet an imperative financial  demand, and you, by your agents, by your secret machinations, have been  the author of insurrection after insurrection, of the most flagrant  breaches of the laws of your country. You have cost innumerable men,  engaged in the pursuit of plain duty, their self-respect, and in several  cases their lives. Another hideous problem is approaching--one, I am  persuaded, that can be solved by arms and bloodshed alone; and to your  pen, to your deliberate unsettling of men's minds, to the hatred you  have inspired for the lawful government of this country, to you, and to  you alone--"    
"It's a lie! a lie!" shouted Jefferson. "You are speaking to an  honourable man, sir! one who occupies a position in this country both by  birth and breeding that you would give your soul--you adventurer!--to  possess. Go back to your Islands! You have no place here among men of  honourable birth. It's monstrous that this country should be ruled by a  foreign bastard--!"    
For a moment, every one present had a confused idea that a tornado was  in the room. Then two doors were wrenched open, Jefferson fled down the  street, with Randolph, bearing his hat, in pursuit; Knox was holding  Hamilton firmly in his arms; and Washington, who had risen some moments  since, and stood staring in grim disgust, awaiting the end, was divided  between a desire to laugh, and to give way to a burst of fury himself.    
Hamilton had made no attempt to struggle when Knox caught him, but he  now withdrew from the relaxing arms, and the Secretary of War left the  room hastily. Hamilton, to Washington's astonishment, flung himself into  a chair, and dropped his head on his arms. In a moment, he began to sob  convulsively. A malignant fever was breeding in his depressed system;  the blood still surged in his head. He had a despairing sense that his  character was in ruins; he was humiliated to his depths; he despised  himself so bitterly that he forgot the existence of Jefferson.    
The humour and anger died out of Washington. He went forward hastily and  locked the door. Then he stooped over Hamilton, and pressed him closely  in his arms.    
"My dear boy!" he said huskily. "My dear boy!"
