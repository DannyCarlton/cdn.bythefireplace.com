  She waited. The ferocity of a mother defending her young filled her  soul, and she moaned in her grief and despair as the seconds passed.  But she did not fire blindly, for she knew she must kill John Graham.  The troublesome thing was a strange film that persisted in gathering  before her eyes, something she tried to brush away, but which  obstinately refused to go. She did not know she was sobbing as she  looked over the rifle barrel. The figures came swiftly, but she had  lost sight of John Graham. They reached the upheaval of shattered rock  and began climbing it, and in her desire to make out the man she hated  she stood above the rampart that had sheltered her. The men looked  alike, jumping and dodging like so many big tundra hares as they came  nearer, and suddenly it occurred to her that<I> all</I> of them were  John Grahams, and that she must kill swiftly and accurately. Only the  hiding fairies might have guessed how her reason trembled and almost  fell in those moments when she began firing. Certainly John Graham and  his men did not, for her first shot was a lucky one, and a man slipped  down among the rocks at the crack of it. After that she continued to  fire until the responseless click of the hammer told her the gun was  empty. The explosions and the shock against her slight shoulder cleared  her vision and her brain. She saw the men still coming, and they were  so near she could see their faces clearly. And again her soul cried out  in its desire to kill John Graham.
  She turned, and for an instant fell upon her knees beside Alan. His  face was hidden in his arm. Swiftly she tore his automatic from its  holster, and sprang back to her rock. There was no time to wait or  choose now, for his murderers were almost upon her. With all her  strength she tried to fire accurately, but Alan's big gun leaped and  twisted in her hand as she poured its fire wildly down among the rocks  until it was empty. Her own smaller weapon she had lost somewhere in  the race to the kloof, and now when she found she had fired her last  shot she waited through another instant of horror, until she was  striking at faces that came within the reach of her arm. And then, like  a monster created suddenly by an evil spirit, Graham was at her side.  She had a moment's vision of his cruel, exultant face, his eyes blazing  with a passion that was almost madness, his powerful body lunging upon  her. Then his arms came about her. She could feel herself crushing  inside them, and fought against their cruel pressure, then broke limply  and hung a resistless weight against him. She was not unconscious, but  her strength was gone, and if the arms had closed a little more they  would have killed her.
  And she could hear&#8212;clearly. She heard suddenly the shots that came  from up the kloof, scattered shots, then many of them, and after that  the strange, wild cries that only the Eskimo herdsmen make.
  Graham's arms relaxed. His eyes swept the fairies' hiding-place with  its white sand floor, and fierce joy lit up his face.
  &#8220;Martens, it couldn't happen in a better place,&#8221; he said to a man  who stood near him. &#8220;Leave me five men. Take the others and help  Schneider. If you don't clean them out, retreat this way, and six  rifles from this ambuscade will do the business in a hurry.&#8221;
  Mary heard the names of the men called who were to stay. The others  hurried away. The firing in the kloof was steady now. But there were no  cries, no shouts&#8212;nothing but the ominous crack of the rifles.
  Graham's arms closed about her again. Then he picked her up and  carried her back into the cavern, and in a place where the rock wall  sagged inward, making a pocket of gloom which was shut out from the  light of day, he laid her upon the carpet of sand.
  Where the erosion of many centuries of dripping water had eaten its  first step in the making of the ragged fissure a fairy had begun to  climb down from the edge of the tundra. He was a swift and agile fairy,  very red in the face, breathing fast from hard running, but making not  a sound as he came like a gopher where it seemed no living thing could  find a hold. And the fairy was Stampede Smith.
  From the lips of the kloof he had seen the last few seconds of the  tragedy below, and where death would have claimed him in a more  reasonable moment he came down in safety now. In his finger-ends was  the old tingling of years ago, and in his blood the thrill which he had  thought was long dead&#8212;the thrill of looking over leveled guns into the  eyes of other men. Time had rolled back, and he was the old Stampede  Smith. He saw under him lust and passion and murder, as in other days  he had seen them, and between him and desire there was neither law nor  conscience to bar the way, and his dream&#8212;a last great fight&#8212;was here  to fill the final unwritten page of a life's drama that was almost  closed. And what a fight, if he could make that carpet of soft, white  sand unheard and unseen. Six to one! Six men with guns at their sides  and rifles in their hands. What a glorious end it would be, for a  woman&#8212;and Alan Holt!
  He blessed the firing up the kloof which kept the men's faces turned  that way; he thanked God for the sound of combat, which made the  scraping of rock and the rattle of stones under his feet unheard. He  was almost down when a larger rock broke loose, and fell to the ledge.  Two of the men turned, but in that same instant came a more thrilling  interruption. A cry, a shrill scream, a woman's voice filled with  madness and despair, came from the depth of the cavern, and the five  men stared in the direction of its agony. Close upon the cries came  Mary Standish, with Graham behind her, reaching out his hands for her.  The girl's hair was flying, her face the color of the white sand, and  Graham's eyes were the eyes of a demon forgetful of all else but her.  He caught her. The slim body crumpled in his arms again while pitifully  weak hands beat futilely in his face.
  And then came a cry such as no man had ever heard in Ghost Kloof  before.
  It was Stampede Smith. A sheer twenty feet he had leaped to the  carpet of sand, and as he jumped his hands whipped out his two guns,  and scarcely had his feet touched the floor of the soft pocket in the  ledge when death crashed from them swift as lightning flashes, and  three of the five were tottering or falling before the other two could  draw or swing a rifle. Only one of them had fired a shot. The other  went down as if his legs had been knocked from under him by a club, and  the one who fired bent forward then, as if making a bow to death, and  pitched on his face.
  And then Stampede Smith whirled upon John Graham.
  During these few swift seconds Graham had stood stunned, with the  girl crushed against his breast. He was behind her, sheltered by her  body, her head protecting his heart, and as Stampede turned he was  drawing a gun, his dark face blazing with the fiendish knowledge that  the other could not shoot without killing the girl. The horror of the  situation gripped Stampede. He saw Graham's pistol rise slowly and  deliberately. He watched it, fascinated. And the look in Graham's face  was the cold and unexcited triumph of a devil. Stampede saw only that  face. It was four inches&#8212;perhaps five&#8212;away from the girl's. There was  only that&#8212;and the extending arm, the crooking finger, the black mouth  of the automatic seeking his heart. And then, in that last second,  straight into the girl's staring eyes blazed Stampede's gun, and the  four inches of leering face behind her was suddenly blotted out. It was  Stampede, and not the girl, who closed his eyes then; and when he  opened them and saw Mary Standish sobbing over Alan's body, and Graham  lying face down in the sand, he reverently raised the gun from which he  had fired the last shot, and pressed its hot barrel to his thin lips.
  Then he went to Alan. He raised the limp head, while Mary bowed her  face in her hands. In her anguish she prayed that she, too, might die,  for in this hour of triumph over Graham there was no hope or joy for  her. Alan was gone. Only death could have come with that terrible red  blot on his forehead, just under the gray streak in his hair. And  without him there was no longer a reason for her to live.
  She reached out her arms. &#8220;Give him to me,&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Give him  to me.&#8221;
  Through the agony that burned in her eyes she did not see the look  in Stampede's face. But she heard his voice.
  &#8220;It wasn't a bullet that hit him,&#8221; Stampede was saying. &#8220;The bullet  hit a rock, an' it was a chip from the rock that caught him square  between the eyes. He isn't dead,<I> and he ain't going to die!</I>&#8220;
  How many weeks or months or years it was after his last memory of  the fairies' hiding-place before he came back to life, Alan could make  no manner of guess. But he did know that for a long, long time he was  riding through space on a soft, white cloud, vainly trying to overtake  a girl with streaming hair who fled on another cloud ahead of him; and  at last this cloud broke up, like a great cake of ice, and the girl  plunged into the immeasurable depths over which they were sailing, and  he leaped after her. Then came strange lights, and darkness, and sounds  like the clashing of cymbals, and voices; and after those things a long  sleep, from which he opened his eyes to find himself in a bed, and a  face very near, with shining eyes that looked at him through a sea of  tears.
  And a voice whispered to him, sweetly, softly, joyously, &#8220;Alan!&#8221;
  He tried to reach up his arms. The face came nearer; it was pressed  against his own, soft arms crept about him, softer lips kissed his  mouth and eyes, and sobbing whispers came with their love, and he knew  the end of the race had come, and he had won.
  This was the fifth day after the fight in the kloof; and on the  sixth he sat up in his bed, bolstered with pillows, and Stampede came  to see him, and then Keok and Nawadlook and Tatpan and Topkok and  Wegaruk, his old housekeeper, and only for a few minutes at a time was  Mary away from him. But Tautuk and Amuk Toolik did not come, and he saw  the strange change in Keok, and knew that they were dead. Yet he  dreaded to ask the question, for more than any others of his people did  he love these two missing comrades of the tundras.
  It was Stampede who first told him in detail what had happened&#8212;but  he would say little of the fight on the ledge, and it was Mary who told  him of that.
  &#8220;Graham had over thirty men with him, and only ten got away,&#8221; he  said. &#8220;We have buried sixteen and are caring for seven wounded at the  corrals. Now that Graham is dead, they're frightened stiff&#8212;afraid  we're going to hand them over to the law. And without Graham or  Rossland to fight for them, they know they're lost.&#8221;
  &#8220;And our men&#8212;my people?&#8221; asked Alan faintly.
  &#8220;Fought like devils.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I know. But&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;They didn't rest an hour in coming from the mountains.&#8221;
  &#8220;You know what I mean, Stampede.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not many, Alan. Seven were killed, including Sokwenna,&#8221; and he  counted over the names of the slain. Tautuk and Amuk Toolik were not  among them.
  &#8220;And Tautuk?&#8221;
  &#8220;He is wounded. Missed death by an inch, and it has almost killed  Keok. She is with him night and day, and as jealous as a little cat if  anyone else attempts to do anything for him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then&#8212;I am glad Tautuk was hit,&#8221; smiled Alan. And he asked, &#8220;Where  is Amuk Toolik?&#8221;
  Stampede hung his head and blushed like a boy.
  &#8220;You'll have to ask<I> her</I>, Alan.&#8221;
  And a little later Alan put the question to Mary.
  She, too, blushed, and in her eyes was a mysterious radiance that  puzzled him.
  &#8220;You must wait,&#8221; she said.
  Beyond that she would say no word, though he pulled her head down,  and with his hands in her soft, smooth hair threatened to hold her  until she told him the secret. Her answer was a satisfied little sigh,  and she nestled her pink face against his neck, and whispered that she  was content to accept the punishment. So where Amuk Toolik had gone,  and what he was doing, still remained a mystery.
  A little later he knew he had guessed the truth.
  &#8220;I don't need a doctor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but it was mighty thoughtful of  you to send Amuk Toolik for one.&#8221; Then he caught himself suddenly.  &#8220;What a senseless fool I am! Of course there are others who need a  doctor more than I do.&#8221;
  Mary nodded. &#8220;But I was thinking chiefly of you when I sent Amuk  Toolik to Tanana. He is riding Kauk, and should return almost any time  now.&#8221; And she turned her face away so that he could see only the pink  tip of her ear.
  &#8220;Very soon I will be on my feet and ready for travel,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Then we will start for the States, as we planned.&#8221;
  &#8220;You will have to go alone, Alan, for I shall be too busy fitting up  the new house,&#8221; she replied, in such a quiet, composed, little voice  that he was stunned. &#8220;I have already given orders for the cutting of  timber in the foothills, and Stampede and Amuk Toolik will begin  construction very soon. I am sorry you find your business in the States  so important, Alan. It will be a little lonesome with you away.&#8221;
  He gasped. &#8220;Mary!&#8221;
  She did not turn. &#8220;<I>Mary!</I>&#8220;
  He could see again that little, heart-like throb in her throat when  she faced him.
  And then he learned the secret, softly whispered, with sweet, warm  lips pressed to his.
  &#8220;It wasn't a doctor I sent for, Alan. It was a minister. We need one  to marry Stampede and Nawadlook and Tautuk and Keok. Of course, you and  I can wait&#8212;&#8221;
  But she never finished, for her lips were smothered with a love that  brought a little sob of joy from her heart.
  And then she whispered things to him which he had never guessed of  Mary Standish, and never quite hoped to hear. She was a little wild, a  little reckless it may be, but what she said filled him with a  happiness which he believed had never come to any other man in the  world. It was not her desire to return to the States at all. She never  wanted to return. She wanted nothing down there, nothing that the  Standish fortune-builders had left her, unless he could find some way  of using it for the good of Alaska. And even then she was afraid it  might lead to the breaking of her dream. For there was only one thing  that would make her happy, and that was<I> his</I> world. She wanted it  just as it was&#8212;the big tundras, his people, the herds, the  mountains&#8212;with the glory and greatness of God all about them in the  open spaces. She now understood what he had meant when he said he was  an Alaskan and not an American; she was that, too, an Alaskan first of  all, and for Alaska she would go on fighting with him, hand in hand,  until the very end. His heart throbbed until it seemed it would break,  and all the time she was whispering her hopes and secrets to him he  stroked her silken hair, until it lay spread over his breast, and  against his lips, and for the first time in years a hot flood of tears  filled his eyes.
  So happiness came to them; and only strange voices outside raised  Mary's head from where it lay, and took her quickly to the window where  she stood a vision of sweet loveliness, radiant in the tumbled  confusion and glory of her hair. Then she turned with a little cry, and  her eyes were shining like stars as she looked at Alan.
  &#8220;It is Amuk Toolik,&#8221; she said. &#8220;He has returned.&#8221;
  &#8220;And&#8212;is he alone?&#8221; Alan asked, and his heart stood still while he  waited for her answer.
  Demurely she came to his side, and smoothed his pillow, and stroked  back his hair. &#8220;I must go and do up my hair, Alan,&#8221; she said then. &#8220;It  would never do for them to find me like this.&#8221;
  And suddenly, in a moment, their fingers entwined and tightened, for  on the roof of Sokwenna's cabin the little gray-cheeked thrush was  singing again.
