After our fortunate escape from the clutches of our too-admiring  Tibetan hosts, we wound our way slowly back through the Maharajah's  territory towards Sir Ivor's headquarters. On the third day out  from the lamasery we camped in a romantic Himalayan valley--a  narrow, green glen, with a brawling stream running in white  cataracts and rapids down its midst. We were able to breathe  freely now; we could enjoy the great tapering deodars that rose in  ranks on the hillsides, the snow-clad needles of ramping rock that  bounded the view to north and south, the feathery bamboo-jungle  that fringed and half-obscured the mountain torrent, whose cool  music--alas, fallaciously cool--was borne to us through the dense  screen of waving foliage. Lady Meadowcroft was so delighted at  having got clear away from those murderous and saintly Tibetans  that for a while she almost forgot to grumble. She even  condescended to admire the deep-cleft ravine in which we bivouacked  for the night, and to admit that the orchids which hung from the  tall trees were as fine as any at her florist's in Piccadilly.  "Though how they can have got them out here already, in this  outlandish place--the most fashionable kinds--when we in England  have to grow them with such care in expensive hot-houses," she  said, "really passes my comprehension."    
She seemed to think that orchids originated in Covent Garden.    
Early next morning I was engaged with one of my native men in  lighting the fire to boil our kettle--for in spite of all  misfortunes we still made tea with creditable punctuality--when a  tall and good-looking Nepaulese approached us from the hills, with  cat-like tread, and stood before me in an attitude of profound  supplication. He was a well-dressed young man, like a superior  native servant; his face was broad and flat, but kindly and good-  humoured. He salaamed many times, but still said nothing.    
"Ask him what he wants," I cried, turning to our fair-weather  friend, the cook.    
The deferential Nepaulese did not wait to be asked. "Salaam,  sahib," he said, bowing again very low till his forehead almost  touched the ground. "You are Eulopean doctor, sahib?"    
"I am," I answered, taken aback at being thus recognised in the  forests of Nepaul. "But how in wonder did you come to know it?"    
"You camp near here when you pass dis way before, and you doctor  little native girl, who got sore eyes. All de country here tell  you is very great physician. So I come and to see if you will turn  aside to my village to help us."    
"Where did you learn English?" I exclaimed, more and more  astonished.    
"I is servant one time at British Lesident's at de Maharajah's  city. Pick up English dere. Also pick up plenty lupee. Velly  good business at British Lesident's. Now gone back home to my own  village, letired gentleman." And he drew himself up with conscious  dignity.    
I surveyed the retired gentleman from head to foot. He had an air  of distinction, which not even his bare toes could altogether mar.  He was evidently a person of local importance. "And what did you  want me to visit your village for?" I inquired, dubiously.    
"White traveller sahib ill dere, sir. Vely ill; got plague. Great  first-class sahib, all same like Governor. Ill, fit to die; send  me out all times to try find Eulopean doctor."    
"Plague?" I repeated, startled. He nodded.    
"Yes, plague; all same like dem hab him so bad down Bombay way."    
"Do you know his name?" I asked; for though one does not like to  desert a fellow-creature in distress, I did not care to turn aside  from my road on such an errand, with Hilda and Lady Meadowcroft,  unless for some amply sufficient reason.    
The retired gentleman shook his head in the most emphatic fashion.  "How me know?" he answered, opening the palms of his hands as if to  show he had nothing concealed in them. "Forget Eulopean name all  times so easily. And traveller sahib name very hard to lemember.  Not got English name. Him Eulopean foleigner."    
"A European foreigner!" I repeated. "And you say he is seriously  ill? Plague is no trifle. Well, wait a minute; I'll see what the  ladies say about it. How far off is your village?"    
He pointed with his hand, somewhat vaguely, to the hillside. "Two  hours' walk," he answered, with the mountaineer's habit of reckoning  distance by time, which extends, under the like circumstances, the  whole world over.    
I went back to the tents, and consulted Hilda and Lady Meadowcroft.  Our spoilt child pouted, and was utterly averse to any detour of  any sort. "Let's get back straight to Ivor," she said, petulantly.  I've had enough of camping out. It's all very well in its way for a  week but when they begin to talk about cutting your throat and all  that, it ceases to be a joke and becomes a wee bit uncomfortable.  I want my feather bed. I object to their villages."    
"But consider, dear," Hilda said, gently. "This traveller is ill,  all alone in a strange land. How can Hubert desert him? It is a  doctor's duty to do what he can to alleviate pain and to cure the  sick. What would we have thought ourselves, when we were at the  lamasery, if a body of European travellers had known we were there,  imprisoned and in danger of our lives, and had passed by on the  other side without attempting to rescue us?"    
Lady Meadowcroft knit her forehead. "That was us," she said, with  an impatient nod, after a pause--"and this is another person. You  can't turn aside for everybody who's ill in all Nepaul. And  plague, too!--so horrid! Besides, how do we know this isn't  another plan of these hateful people to lead us into danger?"    
"Lady Meadowcroft is quite right," I said, hastily. "I never  thought about that. There may be no plague, no patient at all. I  will go up with this man alone, Hilda, and find out the truth. It  will only take me five hours at most. By noon I shall be back with  you."    
"What? And leave us here unprotected among the wild beasts and the  savages?" Lady Meadowcroft cried, horrified. "In the midst of the  forest! Dr. Cumberledge, how can you?"    
"You are <i>not</i> unprotected," I answered, soothing her. "You have  Hilda with you. She is worth ten men. And besides, our Nepaulese  are fairly trustworthy."    
Hilda bore me out in my resolve. She was too much of a nurse, and  had imbibed too much of the true medical sentiment, to let me  desert a man in peril of his life in a tropical jungle. So, in  spite of Lady Meadowcroft, I was soon winding my way up a steep  mountain track, overgrown with creeping Indian weeds, on my road to  the still problematical village graced by the residence of the  retired gentleman.    
After two hours' hard climbing we reached it at last. The retired  gentleman led the way to a house in a street of the little wooden  hamlet. The door was low; I had to stoop to enter it. I saw in a  moment this was indeed no trick. On a native bed, in a corner of  the one room, a man lay desperately ill; a European, with white  hair and with a skin well bronzed by exposure to the tropics.  Ominous dark spots beneath the epidermis showed the nature of the  disease. He tossed restlessly as he lay, but did not raise his  fevered head or look at my conductor. "Well, any news of Ram Das?"  he asked at last, in a parched and feeble voice. Parched and  feeble as it was, I recognised it instantly. The man on the bed  was Sebastian--no other!    
"No news of Lam Das," the retired gentleman replied, with an  unexpected display of womanly tenderness. "Lam Das clean gone;  not come any more. But I bling you back Eulopean doctor, sahib."    
Sebastian did not look up from his bed even then. I could see he  was more anxious about a message from his scout than about his own  condition. "The rascal!" he moaned, with his eyes closed tight.  "The rascal! he has betrayed me." And he tossed uneasily.    
I looked at him and said nothing. Then I seated myself on a low  stool by the bedside and took his hand in mine to feel his pulse.  The wrist was thin and wasted. The face, too, I noticed, had  fallen away greatly. It was clear that the malignant fever which  accompanies the disease had wreaked its worst on him. So weak and  ill was he, indeed, that he let me hold his hand, with my fingers  on his pulse, for half a minute or more without ever opening his  eyes or displaying the slightest curiosity at my presence. One  might have thought that European doctors abounded in Nepaul, and  that I had been attending him for a week, with "the mixture as  before" at every visit.    
"Your pulse is weak and very rapid," I said slowly, in a  professional tone. "You seem to me to have fallen into a perilous  condition."    
At the sound of my voice, he gave a sudden start. Yet even so,  for a second, he did not open his eyes. The revelation of  my presence seemed to come upon him as in a dream. "Like  Cumberledge's," he muttered to himself, gasping. "Exactly like  Cumberledge's. . . . But Cumberledge is dead . . . I must be  delirious. . . . If I didn't <i>know</i> to the contrary, I could have  sworn it was Cumberledge's!"    
I spoke again, bending over him. "How long have the glandular  swellings been present, Professor?" I asked, with quiet  deliberativeness.    
This time he opened his eyes sharply, and looked up in my face. He  swallowed a great gulp of surprise. His breath came and went. He  raised himself on his elbows and stared at me with a fixed stare.  "Cumberledge!" he cried; "Cumberledge! Come back to life, then!  They told me you were dead! And here you are, Cumberledge!"    
"<i>Who</i> told you I was dead?" I asked, sternly.    
He stared at me, still in a dazed way. He was more than half  comatose. "Your guide, Ram Das," he answered at last, half  incoherently. "He came back by himself. Came back without you.  He swore to me he had seen all your throats cut in Tibet. He alone  had escaped. The Buddhists had massacred you."    
"He told you a lie," I said, shortly.    
"I thought so. I thought so. And I sent him back for confirmatory  evidence. But the rogue has never brought it." He let his head  drop on his rude pillow heavily. "Never, never brought it!"    
I gazed at him, full of horror. The man was too ill to hear me,  too ill to reason, too ill to recognise the meaning of his own  words, almost. Otherwise, perhaps, he would hardly have expressed  himself quite so frankly. Though to be sure he had said nothing to  criminate himself in any way; his action might have been due to  anxiety for our safety.    
I fixed my glance on him long and dubiously. What ought I to do  next? As for Sebastian, he lay with his eyes closed, half  oblivious of my presence. The fever had gripped him hard. He  shivered, and looked helpless as a child. In such circumstances,  the instincts of my profession rose imperative within me. I could  not nurse a case properly in this wretched hut. The one thing to  be done was to carry the patient down to our camp in the valley.  There, at least, we had air and pure running water.    
I asked a few questions from the retired gentleman as to the  possibility of obtaining sufficient bearers in the village. As I  supposed, any number were forthcoming immediately. Your Nepaulese  is by nature a beast of burden; he can carry anything up and down  the mountains, and spends his life in the act of carrying.    
I pulled out my pencil, tore a leaf from my note-book, and  scribbled a hasty note to Hilda: "The invalid is--whom do you  think?--Sebastian! He is dangerously ill with some malignant  fever. I am bringing him down into camp to nurse. Get everything  ready for him." Then I handed it over to a messenger, found for me  by the retired gentleman, to carry to Hilda. My host himself I  could not spare, as he was my only interpreter.    
In a couple of hours we had improvised a rough, woven-grass hammock  as an ambulance couch, had engaged our bearers, and had got  Sebastian under way for the camp by the river.    
When I arrived at our tents, I found Hilda had prepared everything  for our patient with her usual cleverness. Not only had she got a  bed ready for Sebastian, who was now almost insensible, but she had  even cooked some arrowroot from our stores beforehand, so that he  might have a little food, with a dash of brandy in it, to recover  him after the fatigue of the journey down the mountain. By the  time we had laid him out on a mattress in a cool tent, with the  fresh air blowing about him, and had made him eat the meal prepared  for him, he really began to look comparatively comfortable.    
Lady Meadowcroft was now our chief trouble. We did not dare to  tell her it was really plague; but she had got near enough back to  civilisation to have recovered her faculty for profuse grumbling;  and the idea of the delay that Sebastian would cause us drove her  wild with annoyance. "Only two days off from Ivor," she cried,  "and that comfortable bungalow! And now to think we must stop here  in the woods a week or ten days for this horrid old Professor! Why  can't he get worse at once and die like a gentleman? But, there!  with <i>you</i> to nurse him, Hilda, he'll never get worse. He couldn't  die if he tried. He'll linger on and on for weeks and weeks  through a beastly convalescence!"    
"Hubert," Hilda said to me, when we were alone once more; "we  mustn't keep her here. She will be a hindrance, not a help. One  way or another we must manage to get rid of her."    
"How can we?" I asked. "We can't turn her loose upon the mountain  roads with a Nepaulese escort. She isn't fit for it. She would be  frantic with terror."    
"I've thought of that, and I see only one thing possible. I must  go on with her myself as fast as we can push to Sir Ivor's place,  and then return to help you nurse the Professor."    
I saw she was right. It was the sole plan open to us. And I had  no fear of letting Hilda go off alone with Lady Meadowcroft and the  bearers. She was a host in herself, and could manage a party of  native servants at least as well as I could.    
So Hilda went, and came back again. Meanwhile, I took charge of  the nursing of Sebastian. Fortunately, I had brought with me a  good stock of jungle-medicines in my little travelling-case,  including plenty of quinine; and under my careful treatment the  Professor passed the crisis and began to mend slowly. The first  question he asked me when he felt himself able to talk once more  was, "Nurse Wade--what has become of her?"--for he had not yet  seen her. I feared the shock for him.    
"She is here with me," I answered, in a very measured voice. "She  is waiting to be allowed to come and help me in taking care of  you."    
He shuddered and turned away. His face buried itself in the  pillow. I could see some twinge of remorse had seized upon him.  At last he spoke. "Cumberledge," he said, in a very low and almost  frightened tone, "don't let her come near me! I can't bear it. I  can't bear it."    
Ill as he was, I did not mean to let him think I was ignorant of  his motive. "You can't bear a woman whose life you have attempted,"  I said, in my coldest and most deliberate way, "to have a hand in  nursing you! You can't bear to let her heap coals of fire on your  head! In that you are right. But, remember, you have attempted <i>my</i>  life too; you have twice done your best to get me murdered."    
He did not pretend to deny it. He was too weak for subterfuges.  He only writhed as he lay. "You are a man," he said, shortly, "and  she is a woman. That is all the difference." Then he paused for a  minute or two. "Don't let her come near me," he moaned once more,  in a piteous voice. "Don't let her come near me!"    
"I will not," I answered. "She shall not come near you. I spare  you that. But you will have to eat the food she prepares; and you  know <i>she</i> will not poison you. You will have to be tended by the  servants she chooses; and you know <i>they</i> will not murder you. She  can heap coals of fire on your head without coming into your tent.  Consider that you sought to take her life--and she seeks to save  yours! She is as anxious to keep you alive as you are anxious to  kill her."    
He lay as in a reverie. His long white hair made his clear-cut,  thin face look more unearthly than ever, with the hectic flush of  fever upon it. At last he turned to me. "We each work for our own  ends," he said, in a weary way. "We pursue our own objects. It  suits <i>me</i> to get rid of <i>her</i>: it suits <i>her</i> to keep <i>me</i> alive. I am no  good to her dead; living, she expects to wring a confession out of  me. But she shall not have it. Tenacity of purpose is the one  thing I admire in life. She has the tenacity of purpose--and so  have I. Cumberledge, don't you see it is a mere duel of endurance  between us?"    
"And may the just side win," I answered, solemnly.    
It was several days later before he spoke to me of it again. Hilda  had brought some food to the door of the tent and passed it in to  me for our patient. "How is he now?" she whispered.    
Sebastian overheard her voice, and, cowering within himself, still  managed to answer: "Better, getting better. I shall soon be well  now. You have carried your point. You have cured your enemy."    
"Thank God for that!" Hilda said, and glided away silently.    
Sebastian ate his cup of arrowroot in silence; then he looked at me  with wistful, musing eyes. "Cumberledge," he murmured at last;  "after all, I can't help admiring that woman. She is the only  person who has ever checkmated me. She checkmates me every time.  Steadfastness is what I love. Her steadfastness of purpose and her  determination move me."    
"I wish they would move you to tell the truth," I answered.    
He mused again. "To tell the truth!" he muttered, moving his head  up and down. "I have lived for science. Shall I wreck all now?  There are truths which it is better to hide than to proclaim.  Uncomfortable truths--truths that never should have been--truths  which help to make greater truths incredible. But, all the same,  I cannot help admiring that woman. She has Yorke-Bannerman's  intellect, with a great deal more than Yorke-Bannerman's force of  will. Such firmness! such energy! such resolute patience! She is  a wonderful creature. I can't help admiring her!"    
I said no more to him just then. I thought it better to let  nascent remorse and nascent admiration work out their own natural  effects unimpeded. For I could see our enemy was beginning to feel  some sting of remorse. Some men are below it. Sebastian thought  himself above it. I felt sure he was mistaken.    
Yet even in the midst of these personal preoccupations, I saw that  our great teacher was still, as ever, the pure man of science.  He noted every symptom and every change of the disease with  professional accuracy. He observed his own case, whenever his mind  was clear enough, as impartially as he would have observed any  outside patient's. "This is a rare chance, Cumberledge," he  whispered to me once, in an interval of delirium. "So few  Europeans have ever had the complaint, and probably none who were  competent to describe the specific subjective and psychological  symptoms. The delusions one gets as one sinks into the coma, for  example, are of quite a peculiar type--delusions of wealth and of  absolute power, most exhilarating and magnificent. I think myself  a millionaire or a Prime Minister. Be sure you make a note of  that--in case I die. If I recover, of course I can write an  exhaustive monograph on the whole history of the disease in the  British Medical Journal. But if I die, the task of chronicling  these interesting observations will devolve upon you. A most  exceptional chance! You are much to be congratulated."    
"You <i>must</i> not die, Professor," I cried, thinking more, I will  confess, of Hilda Wade than of himself. "You must live . . . to  report this case for science." I used what I thought the strongest  lever I knew for him.    
He closed his eyes dreamily. "For science! Yes, for science!  There you strike the right chord! What have I not dared and done  for science? But, in case I die, Cumberledge, be sure you collect  the notes I took as I was sickening--they are most important for  the history and etiology of the disease. I made them hourly. And  don't forget the main points to be observed as I am dying. You  know what they are. This is a rare, rare chance! I congratulate  you on being the man who has the first opportunity ever afforded us  of questioning an intelligent European case, a case where the  patient is fully capable of describing with accuracy his symptoms  and his sensations in medical phraseology."    
He did not die, however. In about another week he was well enough  to move. We carried him down to Mozufferpoor, the first large town  in the plains thereabouts, and handed him over for the stage of  convalescence to the care of the able and efficient station doctor,  to whom my thanks are due for much courteous assistance.    
"And now, what do you mean to do?" I asked Hilda, when our patient  was placed in other hands, and all was over.    
She answered me without one second's hesitation: "Go straight to  Bombay, and wait there till Sebastian takes passage for England."    
"He will go home, you think, as soon as he is well enough?"    
"Undoubtedly. He has now nothing more to stop in India for."    
"Why not as much as ever?"    
She looked at me curiously. "It is so hard to explain," she  replied, after a moment's pause, during which she had been drumming  her little forefinger on the table. "I feel it rather than reason  it. But don't you see that a certain change has lately come over  Sebastian's attitude? He no longer desires to follow me; he wants  to avoid me. That is why I wish more than ever to dog his steps.  I feel the beginning of the end has come. I am gaining my point.  Sebastian is wavering."    
"Then when he engages a berth, you propose to go by the same  steamer?"    
"Yes. It makes all the difference. When he tries to follow we, he  is dangerous; when he tries to avoid me, it becomes my work in life  to follow him. I must keep him in sight every minute now. I must  quicken his conscience. I must make him <i>feel</i> his own desperate  wickedness. He is afraid to face me: that means remorse. The more  I compel him to face me, the more the remorse is sure to deepen."    
I saw she was right. We took the train to Bombay. I found rooms  at the hospitable club, by a member's invitation, while Hilda went  to stop with some friends of Lady Meadowcroft's on the Malabar  Hill. We waited for Sebastian to come down from the interior and  take his passage. Hilda, with her intuitive certainty, felt sure  he would come.    
A steamer, two steamers, three steamers, sailed, and still no  Sebastian. I began to think he must have made up his mind to go  back some other way. But Hilda was confident, so I waited  patiently. At last one morning I dropped in, as I had often done  before, at the office of one of the chief steamship companies. It  was the very morning when a packet was to sail. "Can I see the  list of passengers on the Vindhya?" I asked of the clerk, a sandy-  haired Englishman, tall, thin, and sallow.    
The clerk produced it.    
I scanned it in haste. To my surprise and delight, a pencilled  entry half-way down the list gave the name, "Professor Sebastian."    
"Oh, Sebastian is going by this steamer?" I murmured, looking up.    
The sandy-haired clerk hummed and hesitated. "Well, I believe he's  going, sir," he answered at last; "but it's a bit uncertain. He's  a fidgety man, the Professor. He came down here this morning and  asked to see the list, the same as you have done. Then he engaged  a berth provisionally--'mind, provisionally,' he said--that's why  his name is only put in on the list in pencil. I take it he's  waiting to know whether a party of friends he wishes to meet are  going also."    
"Or wishes to avoid," I thought to myself, inwardly; but I did not  say so. I asked instead, "Is he coming again?"    
"Yes, I think so: at 5.30."    
"And she sails at seven?"    
"At seven, punctually. Passengers must be aboard by half-past six  at latest."    
"Very good," I answered, making up my mind promptly. "I only  called to know the Professor's movements. Don't mention to him  that I came. I may look in again myself an hour or two later."    
"You don't want a passage, sir? You may be the friend he's  expecting."    
"No, I don't want a passage--not at present certainly." Then I  ventured on a bold stroke. "Look here," I said, leaning across  towards him, and assuming a confidential tone: "I am a private  detective"--which was perfectly true in essence--"and I'm dogging  the Professor, who, for all his eminence, is gravely suspected of a  great crime. If you will help me, I will make it worth your while.  Let us understand one another. I offer you a five-pound note to  say nothing of all this to him."    
The sallow clerk's fishy eye glistened. "You can depend upon me,"  he answered, with an acquiescent nod. I judged that he did not  often get the chance of earning some eighty rupees so easily.    
I scribbled a hasty note and sent it round to Hilda: "Pack your  boxes at once, and hold yourself in readiness to embark on the  Vindhya at six o'clock precisely." Then I put my own things  straight; and waited at the club till a quarter to six. At that  time I strolled on unconcernedly into the office. A cab outside  held Hilda and our luggage. I had arranged it all meanwhile by  letter.    
"Professor Sebastian been here again?" I asked.    
"Yes, sir; he's been here; and he looked over the list again; and  he's taken his passage. But he muttered something about  eavesdroppers, and said that if he wasn't satisfied when he got on  board, he would return at once and ask for a cabin in exchange by  the next steamer."    
"That will do," I answered, slipping the promised five-pound note  into the clerk's open palm, which closed over it convulsively.  "Talked about eavesdroppers, did he? Then he knows he's been  shadowed. It may console you to learn that you are instrumental in  furthering the aims of justice and unmasking a cruel and wicked  conspiracy. Now, the next thing is this: I want two berths at  once by this very steamer--one for myself--name of Cumberledge; one  for a lady--name of Wade; and look sharp about it."    
The sandy-haired man did look sharp; and within three minutes we  were driving off with our tickets to Prince's Dock landing-stage.    
We slipped on board unobtrusively, and instantly took refuge in our  respective staterooms till the steamer was well under way, and  fairly out of sight of Kolaba Island. Only after all chance of  Sebastian's avoiding us was gone for ever did we venture up on  deck, on purpose to confront him.    
It was one of those delicious balmy evenings which one gets only at  sea and in the warmer latitudes. The sky was alive with myriads of  twinkling and palpitating stars, which seemed to come and go, like  sparks on a fire-back, as one gazed upward into the vast depths and  tried to place them. They played hide-and-seek with one another  and with the innumerable meteors which shot recklessly every now  and again across the field of the firmament, leaving momentary  furrows of light behind them. Beneath, the sea sparkled almost  like the sky, for every turn of the screw churned up the  scintillating phosphorescence in the water, so that countless  little jets of living fire seemed to flash and die away at the  summit of every wavelet. A tall, spare man in a picturesque cloak,  and with long, lank, white hair, leant over the taffrail, gazing at  the numberless flashing lights of the surface. As he gazed, he  talked on in his clear, rapt voice to a stranger by his side. The  voice and the ring of enthusiasm were unmistakable. "Oh, no," he  was saying, as we stole up behind him, "that hypothesis, I venture  to assert, is no longer tenable by the light of recent researches.  Death and decay have nothing to do directly with the phosphorescence  of the sea, though they have a little indirectly. The light is due  in the main to numerous minute living organisms, most of them  bacilli, on which I once made several close observations and crucial  experiments. They possess organs which may be regarded as miniature  bull's-eye lanterns. And these organs--"    
"What a lovely evening, Hubert!" Hilda said to me, in an apparently  unconcerned voice, as the Professor reached this point in his  exposition.    
Sebastian's voice quavered and stammered for a moment. He tried  just at first to continue and complete his sentence: "And these  organs," he went on, aimlessly, "these bull's-eyes that I spoke  about, are so arranged--so arranged--I was speaking on the subject  of crustaceans, I think--crustaceans so arranged--" then he broke  down utterly and turned sharply round to me. He did not look at  Hilda--I think he did not dare; but he faced me with his head down  and his long, thin neck protruded, eyeing me from under those  overhanging, penthouse brows of his. "You sneak!" he cried,  passionately. "You sneak! You have dogged me by false pretences.  You have lied to bring this about! You have come aboard under a  false name--you and your accomplice!"    
I faced him in turn, erect and unflinching. "Professor Sebastian,"  I answered, in my coldest and calmest tone, "you say what is not  true. If you consult the list of passengers by the Vindhya, now  posted near the companion-ladder, you will find the names of Hilda  Wade and Hubert Cumberledge duly entered. We took our passage  <i>after</i> you inspected the list at the office to see whether our names  were there--in order to avoid us. But you cannot avoid us. We do  not mean that you shall avoid us. We will dog you now through  life--not by lies or subterfuges, as you say, but openly and  honestly. It is <i>you</i> who need to slink and cower, not we. The  prosecutor need not descend to the sordid shifts of the criminal."    
The other passenger had sidled away quietly the moment he saw our  conversation was likely to be private; and I spoke in a low voice,  though clearly and impressively, because I did not wish for a  scene. I was only endeavouring to keep alive the slow, smouldering  fire of remorse in the man's bosom. And I saw I had touched him on  a spot that hurt. Sebastian drew himself up and answered nothing.  For a minute or two he stood erect, with folded arms, gazing  moodily before him. Then he said, as if to himself: "I owe the  man my life. He nursed me through the plague. If it had not been  for that--if he had not tended me so carefully in that valley in  Nepaul--I would throw him overboard now--catch him in my arms and  throw him overboard! I would--and be hanged for it!"    
He walked past us as if he saw us not, silent, erect, moody. Hilda  stepped aside and let him pass. He never even looked at her. I  knew why; he dared not. Every day now, remorse for the evil part  he had played in her life, respect for the woman who had unmasked  and outwitted him, made it more and more impossible for Sebastian  to face her. During the whole of that voyage, though he dined in  the same saloon and paced the same deck, he never spoke to her, he  never so much as looked at her. Once or twice their eyes met by  accident, and Hilda stared him down; Sebastian's eyelids dropped,  and he stole away uneasily. In public, we gave no overt sign of  our differences; but it was understood on board that relations were  strained: that Professor Sebastian and Dr. Cumberledge had been  working at the same hospital in London together; and that owing to  some disagreement between them Dr. Cumberledge had resigned--which  made it most awkward for them to be travelling together by the same  steamer.    
We passed through the Suez Canal and down the Mediterranean. All  the time, Sebastian never again spoke to us. The passengers,  indeed, held aloof from the solitary, gloomy old man, who strode  along the quarter-deck with his long, slow stride, absorbed in his  own thoughts, and intent only on avoiding Hilda and myself. His  mood was unsociable. As for Hilda, her helpful, winning ways made  her a favourite with all the women, as her pretty face did with all  the men. For the first time in his life, Sebastian seemed to be  aware that he was shunned. He retired more and more within himself  for company; his keen eye began to lose in some degree its  extraordinary fire, his expression to forget its magnetic  attractiveness. Indeed, it was only young men of scientific tastes  that Sebastian could ever attract. Among them, his eager zeal, his  single-minded devotion to the cause of science, awoke always a  responsive chord which vibrated powerfully.    
Day after day passed, and we steamed through the Straits and neared  the Channel. Our thoughts began to assume a home complexion.  Everybody was full of schemes as to what he would do when he  reached England. Old Bradshaws were overhauled and trains looked  out, on the supposition that we would get in by such an hour on  Tuesday. We were steaming along the French coast, off the western  promontory of Brittany. The evening was fine, and though, of  course, less warm than we had experienced of late, yet pleasant and  summer-like. We watched the distant cliffs of the Finistere  mainland and the numerous little islands that lie off the shore,  all basking in the unreal glow of a deep red sunset. The first  officer was in charge, a very cock-sure and careless young man,  handsome and dark-haired; the sort of young man who thought more of  creating an impression upon the minds of the lady passengers than  of the duties of his position.    
"Aren't you going down to your berth?" I asked of Hilda, about  half-past ten that night; "the air is so much colder here than you  have been feeling it of late, that I'm afraid of your chilling  yourself."    
She looked up at me with a smile, and drew her little fluffy, white  woollen wrap closer about her shoulders. "Am I so very valuable to  you, then?" she asked--for I suppose my glance had been a trifle  too tender for a mere acquaintance's. "No, thank you, Hubert; I  don't think I'll go down, and, if you're wise, you won't go down  either. I distrust this first officer. He's a careless navigator,  and to-night his head's too full of that pretty Mrs. Ogilvy. He  has been flirting with her desperately ever since we left Bombay,  and to-morrow he knows he will lose her for ever. His mind isn't  occupied with the navigation at all; what <i>he</i> is thinking of is how  soon his watch will be over, so that he may come down off the  bridge on to the quarter-deck to talk to her. Don't you see she's  lurking over yonder, looking up at the stars and waiting for him by  the compass? Poor child! she has a bad husband, and now she has  let herself get too much entangled with this empty young fellow. I  shall be glad for her sake to see her safely landed and out of the  man's clutches."    
As she spoke, the first officer glanced down towards Mrs. Ogilvy,  and held out his chronometer with an encouraging smile which seemed  to say, "Only an hour and a half more now! At twelve, I shall be  with you!"    
"Perhaps you're right, Hilda," I answered, taking a seat beside her  and throwing away my cigar. "This is one of the worst bits on the  French coast that we're approaching. We're not far off Ushant. I  wish the captain were on the bridge instead of this helter-skelter,  self-conceited young fellow. He's too cock-sure. He knows so much  about seamanship that he could take a ship through any rocks on his  course, blindfold--in his own opinion. I always doubt a man who is  so much at home in his subject that he never has to think about it.  Most things in this world are done by thinking."    
"We can't see the Ushant light," Hilda remarked, looking ahead.    
"No; there's a little haze about on the horizon, I fancy. See, the  stars are fading away. It begins to feel damp. Sea mist in the  Channel."    
Hilda sat uneasily in her deck-chair. "That's bad," she answered;  "for the first officer is taking no more heed of Ushant than of his  latter end. He has forgotten the existence of the Breton coast.  His head is just stuffed with Mrs. Ogilvy's eyelashes. Very  pretty, long eyelashes, too; I don't deny it; but they won't help  him to get through the narrow channel. They say it's dangerous."    
"Dangerous!" I answered. "Not a bit of it--with reasonable care.  Nothing at sea is dangerous--except the inexplicable recklessness  of navigators. There's always plenty of sea-room--if they care to  take it. Collisions and icebergs, to be sure, are dangers that  can't be avoided at times, especially if there's fog about. But  I've been enough at sea in my time to know this much at least--that  no coast in the world is dangerous except by dint of reckless  corner-cutting. Captains of great ships behave exactly like two  hansom-drivers in the streets of London; they think they can just  shave past without grazing; and they <i>do</i> shave past nine times out  of ten. The tenth time they run on the rocks through sheer  recklessness, and lose their vessel; and then, the newspapers  always ask the same solemn question--in childish good faith--how  did so experienced and able a navigator come to make such a mistake  in his reckoning? He made <i>no</i> mistake; he simply tried to cut it  fine, and cut it too fine for once, with the result that he usually  loses his own life and his passengers. That's all. We who have  been at sea understand that perfectly."    
Just at that moment another passenger strolled up and joined us--a  Bengal Civil servant. He drew his chair over by Hilda's, and began  discussing Mrs. Ogilvy's eyes and the first officer's flirtations.  Hilda hated gossip, and took refuge in generalities. In three  minutes the talk had wandered off to Ibsen's influence on the  English drama, and we had forgotten the very existence of the Isle  of Ushant.    
"The English public will never understand Ibsen," the newcomer  said, reflectively, with the omniscient air of the Indian civilian.  "He is too purely Scandinavian. He represents that part of the  Continental mind which is farthest removed from the English  temperament. To him, respectability--our god--is not only no  fetish, it is the unspeakable thing, the Moabitish abomination.  He will not bow down to the golden image which our British  Nebuchadnezzar, King Demos, has made, and which he asks us to  worship. And the British Nebuchadnezzar will never get beyond the  worship of his Vishnu, respectability, the deity of the pure and  blameless ratepayer. So Ibsen must always remain a sealed book to  the vast majority of the English people."    
"That is true," Hilda answered, "as to his direct influence; but  don't you think, indirectly, he is leavening England? A man so  wholly out of tune with the prevailing note of English life could  only affect it, of course, by means of disciples and popularisers--  often even popularisers who but dimly and distantly apprehend his  meaning. He must be interpreted to the English by English  intermediaries, half Philistine themselves, who speak his language  ill, and who miss the greater part of his message. Yet only by  such half-hints-- Why, what was that? I think I saw something!"    
Even as she uttered the words, a terrible jar ran fiercely through  the ship from stem to stern--a jar that made one clench one's teeth  and hold one's jaws tight--the jar of a prow that shattered against  a rock. I took it all in at a glance. We had forgotten Ushant,  but Ushant had not forgotten us. It had revenged itself upon us by  revealing its existence.    
In a moment all was turmoil and confusion on deck. I cannot  describe the scene that followed. Sailors rushed to and fro,  unfastening ropes and lowering boats, with admirable discipline.  Women shrieked and cried aloud in helpless terror. The voice of  the first officer could be heard above the din, endeavouring to  atone by courage and coolness in the actual disaster for his  recklessness in causing it. Passengers rushed on deck half clad,  and waited for their turn to take places in the boats. It was a  time of terror, turmoil, and hubbub. But, in the midst of it all,  Hilda turned to me with infinite calm in her voice. "Where is  Sebastian?" she asked, in a perfectly collected tone. "Whatever  happens, we must not lose sight of him."    
"I am here," another voice, equally calm, responded beside her.  "You are a brave woman. Whether I sink or swim, I admire your  courage, your steadfastness of purpose." It was the only time he  had addressed a word to her during the entire voyage.    
They put the women and children into the first boats lowered.  Mothers and little ones went first; single women and widows after.  "Now, Miss Wade," the first officer said, taking her gently by the  shoulders when her turn arrived. "Make haste; don't keep us  waiting!"    
But Hilda held back. "No, no," she said, firmly. "I won't go yet.  I am waiting for the men's boat. I must not leave Professor  Sebastian."    
The first officer shrugged his shoulders. There was no time for  protest. "Next, then," he said, quickly. "Miss Martin--Miss  Weatherly!"    
Sebastian took her hand and tried to force her in. "You <i>must</i> go,"  he said, in a low, persuasive tone. "You must not wait for me!"    
He hated to see her, I knew. But I imagined in his voice--for I  noted it even then--there rang some undertone of genuine desire to  save her.    
Hilda loosened his grasp resolutely. "No, no," she answered, "I  cannot fly. I shall never leave you."    
"Not even if I promise--"    
She shook her head and closed her lips hard. "Certainly not," she  said again, after a pause. "I cannot trust you. Besides, I must  stop by your side and do my best to save you. Your life is all in  all to me. I dare not risk it."    
His gaze was now pure admiration. "As you will," he answered.  "For he that loseth his life shall gain it."    
"If ever we land alive," Hilda answered, glowing red in spite of  the danger, "I shall remind you of that word. I shall call upon  you to fulfil it."    
The boat was lowered, and still Hilda stood by my side. One second  later, another shock shook us. The Vindhya parted amidships, and  we found ourselves struggling and choking in the cold sea water.    
It was a miracle that every soul of us was not drowned that moment,  as many of us were. The swirling eddy which followed as the  Vindhya sank swamped two of the boats, and carried down not a few  of those who were standing on the deck with us. The last I saw of  the first officer was a writhing form whirled about in the water;  before he sank, he shouted aloud, with a seaman's frank courage,  "Say it was all my fault; I accept the responsibility. I ran her  too close. I am the only one to blame for it." Then he  disappeared in the whirlpool caused by the sinking ship, and we  were left still struggling.    
One of the life-rafts, hastily rigged by the sailors, floated our  way. Hilda struck out a stroke or two and caught it. She dragged  herself on to it, and beckoned me to follow. I could see she was  holding on to something tightly. I struck out in turn and reached  the raft, which was composed of two seats, fastened together in  haste at the first note of danger. I hauled myself up by Hilda's  side. "Help me to pull him aboard!" she cried, in an agonised  voice. "I am afraid he has lost consciousness!" Then I looked at  the object she was clutching in her hands. It was Sebastian's  white head, apparently quite lifeless.    
I pulled him up with her and laid him out on the raft. A very  faint breeze from the south-west had sprung up; that and a strong  seaward current that sets round the rocks were carrying us straight  out from the Breton coast and all chance of rescue, towards the  open channel.    
But Hilda thought nothing of such physical danger. "We have saved  him, Hubert!" she cried, clasping her hands. "We have saved him!  But do you think he is alive? For unless he is, <i>my</i> chance, <i>our</i>  chance, is gone forever!"    
I bent over and felt his pulse. As far as I could make out, it  still beat feebly.
