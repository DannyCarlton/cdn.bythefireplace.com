  Peter was on his way to the mystery of the bundle he had found in   the jackpines. 
  At the foot of the ridge, where the green plain fought with the   blighting edge of the Stew-Kettle, he stood for many minutes  before  he started east-ward. With keen eyes gleaming behind his  mop of  scraggly face-bristles he critically surveyed both land and  air, and  then, with the slight limp in his gait which would always  remain as a  mark of Jed Hawkins' brutality, he trotted  deliberately in the  direction of the whiskey-runner's cabin home. 
  A bitter memory of Jed Hawkins flattened his ears when he came   near the rock-cluttered coulee in which he had fought for Nada,  and  had suffered his broken bones, and today&#8212;even as he obeyed  the  instinctive caution to stop and listen&#8212;Jed Hawkins himself  came out  of the mouth of the coulee, bearing a brown jug in one  hand and a  thick cudgel in the other. His one wicked eye gleamed  in the waning  sun. His lean and scraggly face was alight with a  sinister exultation  as he paused for a moment close to the rock  behind which Peter was  hidden, and Peter's fangs lay bare and his  body trembled while the man  stood there. Then he moved on, and  Peter did not stir, but waited  until the jug and the cudgel and  the man were out of sight. 
  Low under his breath he was snarling when he went on. Hatred, for   a moment, had flamed hot in his soul. Then he turned, and buried   himself in a clump of balsams that reached out into the plain, and  a  few moments later came to the edge of a tiny meadow in the heart  of  them, where a warbler was bursting its throat in evening-song. 
  Around the edge of the meadow Peter circled, his feet deep in   buttercups and red fire-flowers, and crushing softly ripe   strawberries that grew in scarlet profusion in the open, until he   came to a screen of young jackpines, and through these he quietly  and  apologetically nosed his way. Then he stood wagging his tail,  with  Nada sitting on the grass half a dozen steps from him, wiping  the  strawberry stain from her finger-tips. And the stain was on  her red  lips, and a bit of it against the flush of her cheek, as  she gave a  little cry of gladness and greeting to Peter. Her eyes  flashed beyond  him, and every drop of blood in her slim, beautiful  little body seemed  to be throbbing with an excitement new to Peter  as she looked for  Jolly Roger. 
  Peter went to her, and dropped down, with his head in her lap, and   looking up through his bushy eye-brows he saw a livid bruise just   under the ripples of her brown hair, where there had been no mark   yesterday, or the day before. Nada's hands drew him closer, until  he  was half in her lap, and she bent her face down to him, so that  her  thick, shining hair fell all about him. Peter loved her hair,  almost  as much as Jolly Roger loved it, and he closed his eyes and  drew a  deep breath of content as the smothering sweetness of it  shut out the  sunlight from him. 
  &quot;Peter,&quot; she whispered, &quot;I'm almost scared to have him come today.   I've promised him. You remember&#8212;I promised to tell him if Jed   Hawkins struck me again. And he has! He made that mark, and if  Jolly  Roger knows it he'll kill him. I've got to lie&#8212;lie&#8212;&quot; 
  Peter wriggled, to show his interest, and his hard tail thumped   the ground. For a space Nada said nothing more, and he could hear  and  feel the beating of her heart close down against him. Then she  raised  her head, and looked in the direction from which she would  first hear  Jolly Roger as he came through the young jackpines.  Peter, with his  eyes half closed in a vast contentment, did not  see or sense the  change in her today&#8212;that her blue eyes were  brighter, her cheeks  flushed, and in her body a strange and  subdued throbbing that had  never been there before. Not even to  Peter did she whisper her secret,  but waited and listened for  Jolly Roger, and when at last she heard  him and he came through  the screen of jackpines, the color in her  cheeks was like the  stain of strawberries crimsoning her finger-tips.  In an instant,  looking down upon her, Jolly Roger saw what Peter had  not  discovered, and he stopped in his tracks, his heart thumping like   a hammer inside him. Never, even in his dreams, had the girl  looked  lovelier than she did now, and never had her eyes met his  eyes as they  met them today, and never had her red lips said as  much to him,  without uttering a word. In the same instant he saw  the livid bruise,  half hidden under her hair&#8212;and then he saw a  big bundle behind her,  partly screened by a dwarfed banksian.  After that his eyes went back  to the bruise. 
  &quot;Jed Hawkins didn't do it,&quot; said Nada, knowing what was in his   mind. &quot;It was Jed's woman. And you can't kill her!&quot; she added a   little defiantly. 
  Jolly Roger caught the choking throb in her throat, and he knew   she was lying. But Nada thrust Peter from her lap, and stood up,  and  she seemed taller and more like a woman than ever before in  her life  as she faced Jolly Roger there in the tiny open, with  violets and  buttercups and red strawberries in the soft grass  under their feet.  And behind them, and very near, a rival to the  warbler in the meadow  began singing. But Nada did not hear. The  color had rushed hot into  her cheeks at first, but now it was  fading out as swiftly, and her  hands trembled, clasped in front of  her. But the blue in her eyes was  as steady as the blue in the sky  as she looked at Jolly Roger. 
  &quot;I'm not going back to Jed Hawkins' any more, Mister Roger,&quot; she   said. 
  A soft breath of wind lifted the tress of hair from her forehead,   revealing more clearly the mark of Jed Hawkins' brutality, and  Nada  saw gathering in Jolly Roger's eyes that cold, steely glitter  which  always frightened her when it came. His hands clenched, and  when she  reached out and touched his arm the flesh of it was as  hard as white  birch. Even in her fear there was glory in the  thought that at a word  from her he would kill the man who had  struck her. Her fingers crept  up his arm, timidly, and the blue in  her eyes darkened, and there was  a pleading tremble in the curve  of her lips as she looked straight at  him. 
  &quot;I'm not going back,&quot; she repeated. 
  Jolly Roger, looking beyond her, saw the significance of the   bundle. His eyes met her steady gaze again, and his heart seemed  to  swell in his chest, and choke him. He tried to let his tense  muscles  relax. He tried to smile. He struggled to bring up the  courage which  would make possible the confession he had to make.  And Peter, sitting  on his haunches in a patch of violets, watched  them both, wondering  what was going to happen between these two. 
  &quot;Where are you going?&quot; Jolly Roger asked. 
  Nada's fingers had crept almost to his shoulder. They were   twisting at his flannel shirt nervously, but not for the tenth  part  of a second did she drop her eyes, and that strange,  wonderful  something which he saw looking at him so clearly out of  her soul  brought the truth to Jolly Roger, before she had spoken. 
  &quot;I'm goin' with you and Peter.&quot; 
  The low cry that came from Jolly Roger was almost a sob as he   stepped back from her. He looked away from her&#8212;at Peter. But her   pale face, her parted red lips, her wide-open, wonderful eyes, her   radiant hair stirred by the wind&#8212;came between them. She was no   longer the little girl&#8212;&quot;past seventeen, goin' on eighteen.&quot; To  Jolly  Roger she was all that the world held of glorious womanhood. 
  &quot;But&#8212;you can't!&quot; he cried desperately. &quot;I've come to tell you   things, Nada. I'm not fit. I'm not what you think I am. I've been   livin' a lie&#8212;&quot; 
  He hesitated, and then lashed himself on to the truth. 
  &quot;You'll hate me when I tell you, Nada. You think Jed Hawkins is   bad. But the law thinks I'm worse. The police want me. They've  wanted  me for years. That's why I came down here, and hid over in  Indian  Tom's cabin&#8212;near where I first met you. I thought they  wouldn't find  me away down here, but they did. That's why Peter  and I moved over to  the big rock-pile at the end of the Ridge.  I'm&#8212;an outlaw. I've done a  lot of bad things&#8212;in the eyes of the  law, and I'll probably die with  a bullet in me, or in jail. I'm  sorry, but that don't help. I'd give  my life to be able to tell  you what's in my heart. But I can't. It  wouldn't be square.&quot; 
  He wondered why no change came into the steady blue of her eyes as   he went on with the truth. The pallor was gone from her cheeks.  Her  lips seemed redder, and what he was saying did not seem to  startle  her, or frighten her. 
  &quot;Don't you understand, Nada?&quot; he cried. &quot;I'm bad. The police want   me. I'm a fugitive&#8212;always running away, always hiding&#8212;an outlaw&#8212;&quot; 
  She nodded. 
  &quot;I know it, Mister Roger,&quot; she said quietly. &quot;I heard you tell   Peter that a long time ago. And Mister Cassidy was at our place  the  day after you and Peter ran away from Indian Tom's cabin, and  I showed  him the way to Father John's, and he told me a lot about  you, and he  told Father John a lot more, and it made me awful  proud of you, Mister  Roger&#8212;and I want to go with you and Peter!&quot; 
  &quot;Proud!&quot; gasped Jolly Roger. &quot;Proud, of ME&#8212;&quot; 
  She nodded again. 
  &quot;Mister Cassidy&#8212;the policeman&#8212;he used just the word you used a   minute ago. He said you was square, even when you robbed other   people. He said he had to get you in jail if he could, but he  hoped  he never would. He said he'd like to have a man like you for  a  brother. And Peter loves you. And I&#8212;&quot; 
  The color came into her white face. 
  &quot;I'm goin' with you and Peter,&quot; she finished. 
  Something came to relieve the tenseness of the moment for Jolly   Roger. Peter, nosing in a thick patch of bunch-grass, put out a  huge  snowshoe rabbit, and the two crashed in a startling avalanche  through  the young jackpines, Peter's still puppyish voice yelling  in a high  staccato as he pursued. Jolly Roger turned from Nada,  and stared where  they had gone. But he was seeing nothing. He knew  the hour of his  mightiest fight had come. In the reckless years of  his adventuring he  had more than once faced death. He had starved.  He had frozen. He had  run the deadliest gantlets of the elements,  of beast, and of man. Yet  was the strife in him now the greatest  of all his life. His heart  thumped. His brain was swirling in a  vague and chaotic struggle for  the mastery of things, and as he  fought with himself&#8212;his unseeing  eyes fixed on the spot where  Peter and the snowshoe rabbit had  disappeared&#8212;he heard Nada's  voice behind him, saying again that she  was going with him and  Peter. In those seconds he felt himself giving  way, and the  determined action he had built up for himself began to  crumble  like sand. He had made his confession and in spite of it this   young girl he worshipped&#8212;sweeter and purer than the flowers of  the  forest&#8212;was urging herself upon him! And his soul cried out  for him to  turn about, and open his arms to her, and gather her  into them for as  long as God saw fit to give him freedom and life. 
  But still he fought against that mighty urge, dragging reason and   right back fragment by fragment, while Nada stood behind him, her   wide-open, childishly beautiful eyes beginning to comprehend the   struggle that was disrupting the heart of this man who was an   outlaw&#8212;and her god among men. And when Jolly Roger turned, his  face  had aged to the grayness of stone, and his eyes were dull,  and there  was a terribly dead note in his voice. 
  &quot;You can't go with us,&quot; he said. &quot;You can't. It's wrong&#8212;all   wrong. I couldn't take care of you in jail, and some day&#8212;that's   where I'll be.&quot; 
  More than once when she had spoken of Jed Hawkins he had seen the   swift flash of lightning come into the violet of her eyes. And it   came now, and her little hands grew tight at her sides, and bright   spots burned in her cheeks. 
  &quot;You won't!&quot; she cried. &quot;I won't let you go to jail. I'll fight   for you&#8212;if you'll let me go with you and Peter!&quot; 
  She came a step nearer. 
  &quot;And if I stay here Jed Hawkins is goin' to sell me to a tie-   cutter over on the railroad. That's what it is&#8212;sellin' me. I   ain't&#8212;I mean I haven't&#8212;told you before, because I was afraid of   what you'd do. But it's goin' to happen, unless you let me go with   you and Peter. Oh, Mister Roger&#8212;Mister Jolly Roger&#8212;&quot; 
  Her fingers crept up his arms. They reached his shoulders, and her   blue eyes, and her red lips, and the woman's soul in her girl-body   were so close to him he could feel their sweetness and thrill, and   then he saw a slow-gathering mist, and tears&#8212; 
  &quot;I'll go wherever you go,&quot; she was whispering, &quot;And we'll hide   where they won't ever find us, and I'll be happy, so happy, Mister   Roger&#8212;and if you won't take me I want to die. Oh&#8212;&quot; 
  She was crying, with her head on his breast, and her slim, half   bare arms around his neck, and Jolly Roger listened like a miser  to  the choking words that came with her sobs. And where there had  been  tumult and indecision in his heart there came suddenly the  clearness  of sunshine and joy, and with it the happiness of a new  and mighty  possession as his arms closed about her, and he turned  her face up, so  that for the first time he kissed the soft red  lips that for some  inscrutable reason the God of all things had  given into his keeping  this day. 
  And then, holding her close, with her arms still tighter about his   neck, he cried softly, 
  &quot;I'm goin' to take you, little girl. You're goin' with Peter and   me, for ever&#8212;and ever. And we'll go&#8212;tonight!&quot; 
  When Peter came back, just in the last sunset glow of the evening,   he found his master alone in the bit of jackpine opening, and Nada   was swiftly crossing the larger meadow that lay between them and  the  break in Cragg's Ridge, beyond which was Jed Hawkins' cabin.  It was  not the same Jolly Roger whom he had left half an hour  before. It was  not the man of the hiding-place in the rock-pile.  Jolly Roger McKay,  standing there in the last soft glow of the  day, was no longer the  fugitive and the outcast. He stood with  silent lips, yet his soul was  crying out its gratitude to all that  God of Life which breathed its  sweetness of summer evening about  him. He was the First Possessor of  the earth. In that hour, that  moment, he would not have sold his place  for all the happiness of  all the remaining people in the world. He  cried out aloud, and  Peter, squatted at his feet with his red tongue  lolling out,  listened to him. 
  &quot;She is mine, mine, mine,&quot; he was saying, and he repeated that   word over and over, until Peter quirked his ears, and wondered  what  it meant. And then, seeing Peter, Jolly Roger laughed softly,  and bent  over him, with a look of awe and wonderment mingling with  the  happiness in his face. 
  &quot;She's mine&#8212;ours,&quot; he cried boyishly. &quot;God A'mighty took a hand,   Pied-Bot, and she's going with us! We're going tonight, when the  moon  comes up. And Peter&#8212;Peter&#8212;we're going straight to the  Missioner's,  and he'll marry us, and then we'll hit for a place  where no one in the  world will ever find us. The law may want us,  Pied-Bot, but God&#8212;this  God all around&#8212;is good to us. And we'll  try and pay Him back. We  will, Peter!&quot; 
  He straightened himself, and faced the west. Then he picked up the   bundle Nada had brought, and dived through the jackpines, with  Peter  at his heels. Swiftly they moved through the shadowing dusk  of the  plain, and came at last to the Stew-Kettle, and to their  hiding-place  under the shoulders of Gog and Magog. There was still  a faint twilight  in the tunnel, and in this twilight Jolly Roger  McKay packed his  possessions; and then, with fingers that trembled  as if they were  committing a sacrilege, he drew Nada's few  treasures from her bundle  and placed them tenderly with his own.  And all the time Peter heard  him saying things under his breath,  so softly that it was like the  whispered drone of song. 
  In darkness they went down through the rocks to the plain, and   half an hour later they came to the break in the Ridge, and went   through it, and stopped in the black shadow of a great rock, with  Jed  Hawkins' cabin half a rifle-shot away. Here Nada was to come  to them  with the first rising of the moon. 
  It was very still all about, and Peter sensed a significance in   the silence, and lay very quietly watching the light in the cabin,   and the shadowy form of his master. Also he knew that somewhere in   the distance a storm was gathering. The breath of it was in the  air,  though the sky was clear of cloud overhead, except for the  haze of a  gray and ghostly mist that lay between them and the  yellow stars.  Jolly Roger counted the seconds between then and  moonrise. It seemed  hours before the golden rim of it rose in the  east. Shadows grew  swiftly after that. Grotesque things took  shape. The rock-caps of the  ridge began to light up, like timid  signal-fires. Black spruce and  balsam and cedar glistened as if  bathed in enamel. And the moon came  on, and mellow floods of light  played in the valleys and plains, and  danced over the forest-tops,  and in voice-less and soundless miracle  called upon all living  things to look upon the glory of God. In his  soul Jolly Roger  McKay felt the urge and the call of that voiceless  Master Power,  and through his lips came an unconscious whisper of  prayer&#8212;of  gratitude. 
  And he watched the light in Jed Hawkins' cabin, and strained his   ears to hear a sound of footsteps coming through the moonlight. 
  But there was no change. The light did not move. A door did not   open or close. There was no sound, except the growing whisper of  the  wind, the call of a night bird, and the howl of the old gray  wolf that  always cried out to the moon from the tangled depths of  Indian Tom's  swamp. 
  A thrill of nervousness swept through Jolly Roger. He waited half   an hour, three-quarters, an hour&#8212;after the moon had risen. And  Nada  did not come. The nervousness grew in him, and he moved out  into the  moon-glow, and slowly and watchfully followed the edge of  the  rock-shadows until he came to the fringe of cedars and spruce  behind  the cabin. Peter, careful not to snap a twig under his  paws, followed  closely. They came to the cabin, and there&#8212;very  distinctly&#8212;Jolly  Roger McKay heard the low moaning of a voice. 
  He edged his way to the window, and looked in. 
  Crouched beside a chair in the middle of the floor was Jed   Hawkins's woman. She was moaning, and her thin body was rocking  back  and forth, and with her hands clasped at her bony breast she  was  staring at the open door. With a shock Jolly Roger saw that  except for  the strangely crying old woman the cabin was empty.  Sudden fear  chilled his blood&#8212;a fear that scarcely took form  before he was at the  door, and in the cabin. The woman's eyes were  red and wild as she  stared at him, and she stopped her moaning,  and her hands unclasped.  Jolly Roger went nearer and bent over her  and shivered at the half-mad  terror he saw in her face. 
  &quot;Where is Nada?&quot; he demanded. &quot;Tell me&#8212;where is she?&quot; 
  &quot;Gone, gone, gone,&quot; crooned the woman, clutching her hands at her   breast again. &quot;Jed has taken her&#8212;taken her to Mooney's shack,  over  near the railroad. Oh, my God!&#8212;I tried to keep her, but I  couldn't.  He dragged her away, and tonight he's sellin' her to  Mooney&#8212;the  devil&#8212;the black brute&#8212;the tie-cutter&#8212;&quot; 
  She choked, and began rocking herself back and forth, and the   moaning came again from her thin lips. Fiercely McKay gripped her  by  the shoulder. 
  &quot;Mooney's shack&#8212;where?&quot; he cried. &quot;Quick! Tell me!&quot; 
  &quot;A thousand&#8212;a thousand&#8212;he's givin' a thousand dollars to git her   in the shack&#8212;alone,&quot; she cried in a dull, sing-song voice. &quot;The  road  out there leads straight to it. Near the railroad. A mile.  Two miles.  I tried to keep him from doin' it, but I couldn't&#8212;I  couldn't&#8212;&quot; 
  Jolly Roger heard no more. He was out of the door, and running   across the open, with Peter racing close behind him. They struck  the  road, and Jolly Roger swung into it, and continued to run  until the  breath was out of his lungs. And all that time the  things Nada had  told him about Jed Hawkins and the tie-cutter were  rushing madly  through his brain. An hour or two ago, when the  words had come from  her lips in the jackpine thicket, he had  believed that Nada was  frightened, that a distorted fear possessed  her, that such a thing as  she had half confessed to him was too  monstrous to happen. And now he  cried out aloud, a groaning,  terrible cry as he went on. Hawkins and  Nada had reached Mooney's  shack long before this, a shack buried deep  in the wilderness, a  shack from which no cries could be heard&#8212; 
  Peter, trotting behind, whined at what he heard in Jolly Roger   McKay's panting voice. And the moon shone on them as they  staggered  and ran, and here and there dark clouds were racing past  the face of  it, and the slumberous whisper of storm grew nearer in  the air. And  then came the time when one of the dark clouds rode  under the moon and  the two ran on in darkness. The cloud passed,  and the moon flooded the  road again with light&#8212;and suddenly Jolly  Roger stopped in his tracks,  and his heart almost broke in the  strain of that moment. 
  Ahead of them, staggering toward them, sobbing as she came, was   Nada. Jolly Roger's blazing eyes saw everything in that vivid  light  of the moon. Her hair was tangled and twisted about her  shoulders and  over her breast. One arm was bare where the sleeve  had been torn away,  and her girlish breast gleamed white where her  waist had been stripped  half from her body. And then she saw Jolly  Roger in the trail, with  wide-open, reaching arms, and with a cry  such as Peter had never heard  come from her lips before she ran  into them, and held up her face to  him in the yellow moon-light.  In her eyes&#8212;great, tearless, burning  pools&#8212;he saw the tragedy  and yet it was only that, and not horror,  not despair, NOT the  other thing. His arms closed crushingly about  her. Her slim body  seemed to become a part of him. Her hot lips  reached up and clung  to his. 
  And then, 
  &quot;Did&#8212;he get you&#8212;to&#8212;Mooney's shack&#8212;&quot; He felt her body stiffen   against him. 
  &quot;No,&quot; she panted. &quot;I fought&#8212;every inch. He dragged me, and hit   me, and tore my clothes&#8212;but I fought. And up there&#8212;in the trail   &#8212;he turned his back for a moment, when he thought I was done, and  I  hit him with a club. And he's there, now, on his back&#8212;&quot; 
  She did not finish. Jolly Roger thrust her out from him, arm's   length. A cloud under the moon hid his face. But his voice was  low,  and terrible. 
  &quot;Nada, go to the Missioner's as fast as you can,&quot; he said,   fighting to speak coolly. &quot;Take Peter&#8212;and go. You will make it   before the storm breaks. I am going back to have a few words with  Jed  Hawkins&#8212;alone. Then I will join you, and the Missioner will  marry  us&#8212;&quot; 
  The cloud was gone, and he saw joy and radiance in her face. Fear   had disappeared. Her eyes were luminous with the golden glow of  the  night. Her red lips were parted, entreating him with the lure  of their  purity and love, and for a moment he held her close in  his arms again,  kissing her as he might have kissed an angel,  while her little hands  stroked his face, and she laughed softly  and strangely in her  happiness&#8212;the wonder of a woman's soul  rising swiftly out of the  sweetness of her girlhood. 
  And then Jolly Roger set her firmly in the direction she was to   go. 
  &quot;Hurry, little girl,&quot; he said. &quot;Hurry&#8212;before the storm breaks!&quot; 
  She went, calling Peter softly, and Jolly Roger strode down the   trail, not once looking back, and bent only upon the vengeance he   would this night wreak upon the two lowest brutes in creation.  Never  before had he felt the desire to kill. But he felt that  desire now.  Before the night was much older he would do unto  Hawkins and Mooney as  Hawkins had done unto Peter. He would leave  them alive, but broken and  crippled and forever punished. 
  And then he stumbled over something in another darkening of the   moon. He stopped, and the light came again, and he looked down  into  the upturned face of Jed Hawkins. It was a distorted and  twisted face,  and its one eye was closed. The body did not move.  And close to the  head was the club which Nada had used. 
  Jolly Roger laughed grimly. Fate was kind to him in making a half   of his work so easy. But he wanted Hawkins to rouse himself first.   Roughly he stirred him with the toe of his boot. 
  &quot;Wake up, you fiend,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm going to break your bones,   your arms, your legs, just as you broke Peter&#8212;and that poor old   woman back in the cabin. Wake up!&quot; 
  Jed Hawkins made no stir. He was strangely limp. For many seconds   Jolly Roger stood looking down at him, his eyes growing wider,  more  staring. Darkness came again. It was an inky blackness this  time, like  a blotter over the world. Low thunder came out of the  west. The  tree-tops whispered in a frightened sort of way. And  Jolly Roger could  hear his heart beating. He dropped upon his  knees, and his hands moved  over Jed Hawkins. For a space not even  Peter could have heard his  movement or his breath. 
  In the ebon darkness he rose to his feet, and the night&#8212;   lifelessly still for a moment&#8212;heard the one choking word that  came  from his lips. 
  &quot;Dead!&quot; 
  And there he stood, the heat of his rage changing to an icy chill,   his heart dragging within him like a chunk of lead, his breath   choking in his throat. Jed Hawkins was dead! He was growing stiff   there in the black trail. He had ceased to breathe. He had ceased  to  be a part of life. And the wind, rising a little with the  coming of  storm, seemed to whisper and chortle over the horrible  thing, and the  lone wolf in Indian Tom's swamp howled weirdly, as  if he smelled  death. 
  Jolly Roger McKay's finger-nails dug into the flesh of his palms.   If he had killed the human viper at his feet, if his own hands had   meted out his punishment, he would not have felt the clammy terror   that wrapped itself about him in the darkness. But he had come too   late. It was Nada who had killed Jed Hawkins. Nada, with her  woman's  soul just born in all its glory, had taken the life of her   foster-father. And Canadian law knew no excuse for killing. 
  The chill crept to his finger-tips, and unconsciously, in a   childish sort of way, he sobbed between his clenched teeth. The   thunder was rolling nearer, and it was like a threatening voice, a   deep-toned booming of a thing inevitable and terrible. He felt the   air shivering about him, and suddenly something moved softly  against  his foot, and he heard a questioning whine. It was Peter&#8212;  come back  to him in this hour when he needed a living thing to  give him courage.  With a groan he dropped on his knees again, and  clutched his hands  about Peter. 
  &quot;My God,&quot; he breathed huskily. &quot;Peter, she's killed him. And she   mustn't know. We mustn't let anyone know&#8212;&quot; 
  And there he stopped, and Peter felt him growing rigid as stone,   and for many moments Jolly Roger's body seemed as lifeless as that  of  the man who lay with up-turned face in the trail. Then he  fumbled in a  pocket and found a pencil and an old envelope. And on  the envelope,  with the darkness so thick he could not see his  hand, he scribbled, &quot;I  killed Jed Hawkins,&quot; and after that he  signed his name firmly and  fully&#8212;&quot;Jolly Roger McKay.&quot; 
  Then he tucked the envelope under Jed Hawkins' body, where the   rain could not get at it. And after that, to make the evidence   complete, he covered the dead man's face with his coat. 
  &quot;We've got to do it, Peter,&quot; he said, and there was a new note in   his voice as he stood up on his feet again. &quot;We've got to do it&#8212;  for  her. We'll&#8212;tell her we caught Jed Hawkins in the trail and  killed  him.&quot; 
  Caution, cleverness, his old mental skill returned to him. He   dragged the boot-legger's body to a new spot, turned it face down,   threw the club away, and kicked up the earth with his boots to  give  signs of a struggle. 
  The note in his voice was triumph&#8212;triumph in spite of its   heartbreak&#8212;as he turned back over the trail after he had  finished,  and spoke to Peter. 
  &quot;We may have done some things we oughtn't to, Pied-Bot,&quot; he said,   &quot;but tonight I sort o' think we've tried to make&#8212;restitution. And  if  they hang us, which they probably will some time, I sort o'  think  it'll make us happy to know we've done it&#8212;for her. Eh,  Pied-Bot?&quot; 
  And the moon sailed out for a space, and shone on the dead   whiteness of Jolly Roger's face. And on the lips of that face was  a  strange, cold smile, a smile of mastery, of exaltation, and the  eyes  were looking straight ahead&#8212;the eyes of a man who had made  his  sacrifice for a thing more precious to him than his God. 
  Only now and then did the moon gleam through the slow-moving   masses of black cloud when he came to the edge of the Indian   settlement clearing three miles away, where stood the cabin of the   Missioner. The storm had not broken, but seemed holding back its   forces for one mighty onslaught upon the world. The thunder was   repressed, and the lightning held in leash, with escaping flashes  of  it occasionally betraying the impending ambuscades of the sky. 
  The clearing itself was a blot of stygian darkness, with a yellow   patch of light in the center of it&#8212;the window of the Missioner's   cabin. And Jolly Roger stood looking at it for a space, as a  carven  thing of rock might have stared. His heart was dead. His  soul crushed.  His dream broken. There remained only his brain, his  mind made up, his  worship for the girl&#8212;a love that had changed  from a thing of joy to a  fire of agony within him. Straight ahead  he looked, knowing there was  only one thing for him to do. And  only one. There was no alternative.  No hope. No change of fortune  that even the power of God might bring  about. What lay ahead of  him was inevitable. 
  After all, there is something unspeakable in the might and glory   of dying for one's country&#8212;or for a great love. And Jolly Roger   McKay felt that strength as he strode through the blackness, and   knocked at the door, and went in to face Nada and the little old   gray-haired Missioner in the lampglow. 
  Swift as one of the flashes of lightning in the sky the anxiety   and fear had gone out of Nada's face, and in an instant it was   flooded with the joy of his coming. She did not mark the strange   change in him, but went to him as she had gone to him in the  trail,  and Jolly Roger's arms closed about her, but gently this  time, and  very tenderly, as he might have held a little child he  was afraid of  hurting. Then she felt the chill of his lips as she  pressed her own to  them. Startled, she looked up into his eyes.  And as he had done in the  trail, so now Jolly Roger stood her away  from him, and faced the  Missioner. In a cold, hard voice he told  what had happened to Nada  that evening, and of the barbarous  effort Jed Hawkins had made to sell  her to Mooney. Then, from a  pocket inside his shirt, he drew out a  small, flat leather wallet,  and thrust it in the little Missioner's  hand. 
  &quot;There's close to a thousand dollars in that,&quot; he said. &quot;It's   mine. And I'm giving it to you&#8212;for Nada. I want you to keep her,  and  care for her, and mebby some day&#8212;&quot; 
  With both her hands Nada clutched his arm. Her eyes had widened.   Swift pallor had driven the color from her face, and a broken cry  was  in her voice. 
  &quot;I'm goin' with you,&quot; she protested. &quot;I'm goin' with you&#8212;and   Peter!&quot; 
  &quot;You can't&#8212;now,&quot; he said. &quot;I've got to go alone, Nada. I went   back&#8212;and I killed Jed Hawkins.&quot; 
  Over the roof of the cabin rolled a crash of thunder. As the   explosion of it rocked the floor under their feet, Jolly Roger   pointed to a door, and said, 
  &quot;Father, if you will leave us alone&#8212;just a minute&#8212;&quot; 
  White-faced, clutching the wallet, the little gray Missioner   nodded, and went to the door, and as he opened it and entered into   the darkness of the other room he saw Jolly Roger McKay open wide  his  arms, and the girl go into them. After that the storm broke.  The rain  descended in a deluge upon the cabin roof. The black  night was filled  with the rumble and roar and the hissing  lightning-flare of pent-up  elements suddenly freed of bondage. And  in the darkness and tumult the  Missioner stood, a little gray man  of tragedy, of deeply buried  secrets, a man of prayer and of faith  in God&#8212;his heart whispering for  guidance and mercy as he waited.  The minutes passed. Five. Ten. And  then there came a louder  roaring of the storm, shut off quickly, and  the little Missioner  knew that a door was opened&#8212;and closed. 
  He lifted the latch, and looked out again into the lampglow.   Huddled at the side of a chair on the floor, her arms and face  buried  in the lustrous, disheveled mass of her shining hair&#8212;lay  Nada, and  close beside her was Peter. He went to her. Tenderly he  knelt down  beside her. His thin arm went about her, and as the  storm raved and  shrieked above them he tried to comfort her&#8212;and  spoke of God. 
  And through that storm, his head bowed, his heart gone, went Jolly   Roger McKay&#8212;heading north.
