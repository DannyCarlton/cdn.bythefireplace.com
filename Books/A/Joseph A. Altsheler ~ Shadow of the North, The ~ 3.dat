  The day advanced, brilliant with sunshine, and the forces of St. Luc  were quiet. For a long time, not a shot was fired, and it seemed to the  besieged that the forest was empty of human beings save themselves.  Robert did not believe the French leader would attempt a long siege,  since an engagement could not be conducted in that manner in the  forest, where a result of some kind must be reached soon. Yet it was  impossible to tell what plan St. Luc had in mind, and they must wait  until Tayoga came.
  Young Captain Colden was in good spirits. It was his first taste of  wilderness warfare, and he knew that he had done well. The dead were  laid decently among the bushes to receive Christian burial later, if  the chance came, and the wounded, their hurts bound up, prepared to  take what part they could in a new battle. Robert crept to the edge of  the cliff, and looked toward the west, whence Tayoga had gone. He saw  only a dazzling blue sky, unflecked by anything save little white  clouds, and there was nothing to indicate whether the mission of his  young Onondaga comrade would have any success. He crept back to the  side of Willet.
  &#8220;Have you any opinion, Dave, about the smoke that Tayoga saw,&#8221; he  asked.
  &#8220;None, Robert, just a hope. It might have been made by another  French and Indian band, most probably it was, but there is a chance,  too, that friends built the fire.&#8221;
  &#8220;If it's a force of any size it could hardly be English. I don't  think any troop of ours except Captain Colden's is in this region.&#8221;
  &#8220;We can't look for help from our own race.&#8221;
  Robert was silent, gazing intently into the west, whence Tayoga had  gone. He recognized the immense difficulties of their position.  Indians, if an attack or two of theirs failed, would be likely to go  away, but the French, and especially St. Luc, would increase their  persistence and hold them to the task. He returned to the forest, and  his attention was drawn once more by Black Rifle. The man was lying  almost flat in the thicket, and evidently he had caught a glimpse of a  foe, as he was writhing slowly forward like a great beast of prey, and  his eyes once more had the expectant look of one who is going to  strike. Robert considered him. He knew that the man's whole nature had  been poisoned by the great tragedy in his life, and that it gave him a  sinister pleasure to inflict blows upon those who had inflicted the  great blow upon him. Yet he would be useful in the fierce war that was  upon them and he was useful now.
  Black Rifle crept forward two or three yards more, and, after he had  lain quite still for a few moments, he suddenly thrust out his rifle  and fired. A cry came from the opposing thicket and Robert heard the  sharpshooter utter a deep sigh of satisfaction. He knew that St. Luc  was one warrior less, which was good for the defense, but he shuddered  a little. He could never bring himself to steal through the bushes and  shoot an unseeing enemy. Still Black Rifle was Black Rifle, and being  what he was he was not to be judged as other men were.
  After a half hour's silence, the besiegers suddenly opened fire from  five or six points, sending perhaps two score bullets into the wood,  clipping off many twigs and leaves which fell upon the heads of the  defenders. Captain Colden did not forget to be grateful to Willet for  his insistence that the soldiers should always lie low, as the hostile  lead, instead of striking, now merely sent a harmless shower upon them.  But the fusillade was brief, Robert, in truth, judging that it had been  against the commands of St. Luc, who was too wise a leader to wish  ammunition to be wasted in random firing. At the advice of Willet,  Captain Colden would not let his men reply, restraining their  eagerness, and silence soon returned.
  It was nearly noon now and a huge golden sun shone over the vast  wilderness in which two little bands of men fought, mere motes in the  limitless sea of green. Robert ate some venison, and drank a little  water from the canteen of a friendly soldier. Then his thoughts turned  again to Tayoga. The Onondaga was a peerless runner, he had been gone  long now, and what would he find at the base of the smoke? If it had  been the fire of an enemy then he would be back in the middle of the  afternoon, and they would be in no worse case than before. They might  try to escape in the night down the cliff, but it was not likely that  vigilant foes would permit men, clumsy in the woods like the soldiers,  to steal away in such a manner.
  The earlier hours of the afternoon were passed by the sharpshooters  on either side trying to stalk one another. Although Robert had no part  in it, it was a savage play that alternately fascinated and repelled  him. He had no way to tell exactly, but he believed that two more of  the Indians had fallen, while a soldier received a wound. A bullet  grazed Black Rifle's head, but instead of daunting him it seemed to  give him a kind of fierce joy, and to inspire in him a greater desire  to slay.
  These efforts, since they achieved no positive results, soon died  down, and both sides lay silent in their coverts. Robert made himself  as comfortable as he could behind a log, although he longed to stand  upright, and walk about once more like a human being. It was now  mid-afternoon and if the smoke had meant nothing good for them it was  time for Tayoga to be back. It was not conceivable that such a  marvelous forester and matchless runner could have been taken, and,  since he had not come, Robert's heart again beat to the tune of hope.
  Willet with whom he talked a little, was of like opinion. He looked  to Tayoga to bring them help, and, if he failed their case, already  hard, would become harder. The hunter did not conceal from himself the  prowess and skill of St. Luc and he knew too, that the savage  persistency of Tandakora was not to be held lightly. Like Robert he  gazed long into the blue west, which was flecked only by little clouds  of white.
  &#8220;A sign! A sign!&#8221; he said. &#8220;If we could only behold a sign!&#8221;
  But the heavens said nothing. The sun, a huge ball of glowing  copper, was already far down the Western curve, and the hunter's heart  beat hard with anxiety. He felt that if help came it should come soon.  But little water was left to the soldiers, although their food might  last another day, and the night itself, now not far away, would bring  the danger of a new attack by a creeping foe, greatly superior in  numbers. He turned away from the cliff, but Robert remained, and  presently the youth called in a sharp thrilling whisper:
  &#8220;Dave! Dave! Come back!&#8221;
  Robert had continued to watch the sky and he thought he saw a faint  dark line against the sea of blue. He rubbed his eyes, fearing it was a  fault of vision, but the trace was still there, and he believed it to  be smoke.
  &#8220;Dave! Dave! The signal! Look! Look!&#8221; he cried.
  The hunter came to the edge of the cliff and stared into the west. A  thread of black lay across the blue, and his heart leaped.
  &#8220;Do you believe that Tayoga has anything to do with it?&#8221; asked  Robert.
  &#8220;I do. If it were our foes out there he'd have been back long  since.&#8221;
  &#8220;And since it may be friends they've sent up this smoke, hoping  we'll divine what they mean.&#8221;
  &#8220;It looks like it. Tayoga is a sharp lad, and he'll want to put  heart in the soldiers. It must be the Onondaga, and I wish I knew what  his smoke was saying.&#8221;
  Captain Colden joined them, and they pointed out to him the trace  across the sky which was now broadening, explaining at the same time  that it was probably a signal sent up by Tayoga, and that he might be  leading a force to their aid.
  &#8220;What help could he bring?&#8221; asked the captain.
  Willet shook his head.
  &#8220;I can't answer you there,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;but the smoke has  significance for us. Of that I feel sure. By sundown we'll know what it  means.&#8221;
  &#8220;And that's only about two hours away,&#8221; said Captain Colden.  &#8220;Whatever happens we'll hold out to the last. I suppose, though, that  St. Luc's force also will see the smoke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Quite likely,&#8221; replied Willet, &#8220;and the Frenchman may send a  runner, too, to see what it means, but however good a runner he may be  he'll be no match for Tayoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's sure,&#8221; said Robert.
  So great was his confidence in the Onondaga that it never occurred  to him that he might be killed or taken, and he awaited his certain  return, either with or without a helping force. He lay now near the  edge of the cliff, whence he could look toward the west, the point of  hope, whenever he wished, ate another strip of venison, and took  another drink of water out of a friendly canteen.
  The west was now blazing with terraces of red and yellow, rising  above one another, and the east was misty, gray and dim. Twilight was  not far away. The thread of smoke that had lain against the sky above  the forest was gone, the glittering bar of red and gold being  absolutely free from any trace. St. Luc's force opened fire again,  bullets clipping twigs and leaves, but the defense lay quiet, except  Black Rifle, who crept back and forth, continually seeking a target,  and pulling the trigger whenever he found it.
  The misty gray in the east turned to darkness, in the west the sun  went down the slope of the world, and the brilliant terraces of color  began to fade. The firing ceased and another tense period of quiet,  hard, to endure, came. At the suggestion of the hunter Colden drew in  his whole troop near the cliff and waited, all, despite their weariness  and strain, keeping the keenest watch they could.
  But Robert, instead of looking toward the east, where St. Luc's  force was, invariably looked into the sunset, because it was there that  Tayoga had gone, and it was there that they had seen the smoke, of  which they expected so much. The terraces of color, already grown dim,  were now fading fast. At the top they were gone altogether, and they  only lingered low down. But on the forest the red light yet blazed.  Every twig and leaf seemed to stand individual and distinct, black  against a scarlet shield. But it was for merely a few minutes. Then all  the red glow disappeared, like a great light going out suddenly, and  the western forest as well as the eastern, lay in a gray gloom.
  It always seemed to Robert that the last going of the sunset that  day was like a signal, because, when the night swept down, black and  complete everywhere, there was a burst of heavy firing from the south  and a long exultant yell. No bullet sped through the thickets, where  the defenders lay, and Willet cried:
  &#8220;Tayoga! Tayoga and help! Ah, here they come! The Mohawks!&#8221;
  Tayoga, panting from exertion, sprang into the bushes among them,  and he was followed by a tall figure in war paint, lofty plumes waving  from his war bonnet. Behind him came many warriors, and others were  already on the flanks, spreading out like a fan, filing rapidly and  shouting the war whoop. Robert recognized at once the great figure that  stood before them. It was Daganoweda, the young Mohawk chief of his  earlier acquaintance, whom he had met both on the war path and at the  great council of the fifty sachems in the vale of Onondaga. Had his  been the right to choose the man who was to come to their aid, the  Mohawk would have been his first choice. Robert knew his intense hatred  of the French and their red allies, and he also knew his fierce courage  and great ability in battle.
  The soldiers looked in some alarm at the painted host that had  sprung among them, but Willet and Robert assured them insistently that  these were friends, and the sound of the battle they were already  waging on the flank with St. Luc's force, was proof enough.
  &#8220;Captain Colden,&#8221; said Robert, not forgetful that an Indian likes  the courtesies of life, and can take his compliments thick, &#8220;this is  the great young Mohawk Chief, Daganoweda, which in our language means  'The Inexhaustible' and such he is, inexhaustible in resource and  courage in battle, and in loyalty to his friends.&#8221;
  Daganoweda smiled and extended his hand in the white man's fashion.  Young Colden had the tact to shake it heartily at once and to say in  English, which the young Mohawk chief understood perfectly:
  &#8220;Daganoweda, whatever praise of you Mr. Lennox has given it's not  half enough. I confess now although I would not have admitted it  before, that if you had not come we should probably have been lost.&#8221;
  He had made a friend for life, and then, without further words the  two turned to the battle. But Robert remained for a minute beside  Tayoga, whose chest was still heaving with his great exertions.
  &#8220;Where did you find them?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Many miles to the west, Lennox. After I descended the cliff I was  pursued by Huron skirmishers, and I had to shake them off. Then I ran  at full speed toward the point where the smoke had risen, knowing that  the need was great, and I overtook Daganoweda and the Mohawks. Their  first smoke was but that from a camp-fire, as being in strong force  they did not care who saw them, but the last, just before the sunset,  was sent up as a signal by two warriors whom we left behind for the  purpose. We thought you might take it to mean that help was coming.&#8221;
  &#8220;And so we did. How many warriors has Daganoweda?&#8221;
  &#8220;Fifty, and that is enough. Already they push the Frenchman and his  force before them. Come, we must join them, Dagaeoga. The breath has  come back into my body and I am a strong man again!&#8221;
  The two now quickly took their places in the battle in the night and  the forest, the position of the two forces being reversed. The soldiers  and the Mohawks were pushing the combat at every point, and the agile  warriors extending themselves on the flanks had already driven in St.  Luc's skirmishers. Black Rifle, uttering fierce shouts, was leading a  strong attack in the center. The firing was now rapid and much heavier  than it had been at any time before. Flashes of flame appeared  everywhere in the thicket. Above the crackle of rifles and muskets  swelled the long thrilling war cry of the Mohawks, and back in fierce  defiance came the yells of the Hurons and Abenakis.
  Willet joined Robert and the two, with Tayoga, saw that the soldiers  fought well under cover. The young Philadelphians, in the excitement of  battle and of a sudden and triumphant reversal of fortune, were likely  to expose themselves rashly, and the advice of the forest veterans was  timely. Captain Colden saw that it was taken, although two more of his  men were slain as they advanced and several were wounded. But the issue  was no longer doubtful. The weight that the Mohawks had suddenly thrown  into the battle was too great. The force of St. Luc was steadily driven  northward, and Daganoweda's alert skirmishers on the flanks kept it  compressed together.
  Robert knew how bitter the defeat would be to St. Luc, but the  knowledge did not keep his exultation from mounting to a high pitch.  St. Luc might strive with all his might to keep his men in the battle,  but the Frenchmen could not be numerous, and it was the custom of  Indians, once a combat seemed lost, to melt away like a mist. They  believed thoroughly that it was best to run away and fight another day,  and there was no disgrace in escaping from a stricken field.
  &#8220;They run! They run! And the Frenchmen must run with them!&#8221;  exclaimed Black Rifle. As he spoke, a bullet grazed his side and struck  a soldier behind him, but the force pressed on with the ardor fed by  victory. Willet did not try any longer to restrain them, although he  understood full well the danger of a battle in the dark. But he knew  that Daganoweda and his Mohawks, experienced in every forest wile,  would guard them against surprise, and he deemed it best now that they  should strike with all their might.
  Robert seldom saw any of the warriors before him, and he did not  once catch a glimpse of a Frenchman. Whenever his rifle was loaded he  fired at a flitting form, never knowing whether or not his bullet  struck true, and glad of his ignorance. His sensitive and imaginative  mind became greatly excited. The flashes of flame in the thickets were  multiplied a hundred fold, a thousand little pulses beat heavily in his  temples, and the shouts of the savages seemed to fill the forest. But  he pressed on, conscious that the enemy was disappearing before them.
  In his eagerness he passed ahead of Willet and Tayoga and came very  near to St. Luc's retreating line. His foot became entangled in  trailing vines and he fell, but he was up in an instant, and he fired  at a shadowy figure not more than twenty feet in advance. In his haste  he missed, and the figure, turning, raised a rifle. There was a fair  moonlight and Robert saw the muzzle of the weapon bearing directly upon  him, and he knew too that the rifle was held by firm hands. His vivid  and sensitive imagination at once leaped into intense life. His own  weapon was empty and his last moment had come. He saw the strong brown  hands holding the rifle, and then his gaze passed on to the face of St.  Luc. He saw the blue eyes of the Frenchman, as they looked down the  sights, open wide in a kind of horror. Then he abruptly dropped the  muzzle, waved one hand to Robert, and vanished in the thickets and the  darkness.
  The battle was over. There were a few dying shots, scattered beads  of flame, an occasional shout of triumph from the Mohawks, a defiant  yell or two in reply from the Hurons and the Abenakis, and then the  trail of the combat swept out of the sight and hearing of Robert, who  stood dazed and yet with a heart full of gratitude. St. Luc had held  his life upon the pressure of a trigger, and the trigger would have  been pulled had he not seen before it was too late who stood before the  muzzle of his rifle. The moonlight was enough for Robert to see that  look of horror in his eyes when he recognized the target. And then the  weapon had been turned away and he had gone like a flash! Why? For what  reason had St. Luc spared him in the heat and fury of a desperate and  losing battle? It must have been a powerful motive for a man to stay  his bullet at such a time!
  &#8220;Wake up, lad! Wake up! The battle has been won!&#8221;
  Willet's heavy but friendly hand fell upon his shoulder, and Robert  came out of his daze. He decided at once that he would say nothing  about the meeting with St. Luc, and merely remarked in a cryptic  manner:
  &#8220;I was stunned for a moment by a bullet that did not hit me. Yes,  we've won, Dave, thanks to the Mohawks.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks to Daganoweda and his brave Mohawks, and to Tayoga, and to  the gallant Captain Colden and his gallant men. All of us together have  made the triumph possible. I understand that the bodies of only two  Frenchmen have been found and that neither was that of St. Luc. Well,  I'm glad. That Frenchman will do us great damage in this war, but he's  an honorable foe, and a man of heart, and I like him.&#8221;
  A man of heart! Yes, truly! None knew it better than Robert, but  again he kept his own counsel. He too was glad that his had not been  one of the two French bodies found, but there was still danger from the  pursuing Mohawks, who would hang on tenaciously, and he felt a sudden  thrill of alarm. But it passed, as he remembered that the chevalier was  a woodsman of experience and surpassing skill.
  Tayoga came back to them somewhat blown. He had followed the fleeing  French and Indian force two or three miles. But there was a limit even  to his nerves and sinews of wrought steel. He had already run thirty  miles before joining in the combat, and now it was time to rest.
  &#8220;Come, Tayoga,&#8221; said the hunter, &#8220;we'll go back to the ground our  lads have defended so well, and eat, drink and sleep. The Mohawks will  attend to all the work that's left, which isn't much. We've earned our  repose.&#8221;
  Captain Colden, slightly wounded in the arm, appeared and Willet  gave him the high compliments that he and his soldiers deserved. He  told him it was seldom that men unused to the woods bore themselves so  well in an Indian fight, but the young captain modestly disclaimed the  chief merit, replying that he and his detachment would surely have been  lost, had it not been for Willet and his comrades.
  Then they went back to the ground near the cliff, where they had  made their great fight, and Willet although the night was warm, wisely  had a large fire built. He knew the psychological and stimulating  effect of heat and light upon the lads of the city, who had passed  through such a fearful ordeal in the dark and Indian-haunted forest. He  encouraged them to throw on more dead boughs, until the blaze leaped  higher and higher and sparkled and roared, sending up myriads of joyous  sparks that glowed for their brief lives among the trees and then died.  No fear of St. Luc and the Indians now! That fierce fringe of Mohawks  was a barrier that they could never pass, even should they choose to  return, and no such choice could possibly be theirs! The fire crackled  and blazed in increasing volume, and the Philadelphia lads, recovering  from the collapse that had followed tremendous exertions and  excitement, began to appreciate the extent of their victory and to talk  eagerly with one another.
  But the period of full rest had not yet come. Captain Colden made  them dig with their bayonets shallow graves for their dead, six in  number. Fluent of speech, his sensitive mind again fitting into the  deep gravity of the situation, Robert said a few words above them,  words that he felt, words that moved those who heard. Then the earth  was thrown in and stones and heavy boughs were placed over all to keep  away the digging wolves or other wild animals.
  The wounded were made as comfortable as possible before the fire,  and in the light of the brilliant flames the awe created by the dead  quickly passed. Food was served and fresh water was drunk, the canteens  being refilled from a spring that Tayoga found a quarter of a mile  away. Then the soldiers, save six who had been posted as guard,  stretched themselves on grass or leaves, and fell asleep, one by one.  Tayoga who had made the greatest physical effort followed them to the  land of slumber, but Captain Colden sat and talked with Robert and  Willet, although it was now far past midnight.
  The bushes parted and a dark figure, making no sound as it came,  stepped into the circle of light. It was Black Rifle and his eyes still  glittered, but he said nothing. Robert thought he saw upon his face a  look of intense satisfaction and once more he shuddered a little. The  man lay down with his rifle beside him, and fell asleep, his hands  still clutching his weapon.
  Before dawn Daganoweda and the Mohawks came back also, and Robert in  behalf of them all thanked the young chief in the purest Mohawk, and  with the fine phrasing and apt allegory so dear to the Indian heart.  Daganoweda made a fitting reply, saying that the merit did not belong  to him but to Manitou, and then, leaving a half dozen of his warriors  to join in the watch, he and the others slept before the fire.
  &#8220;It was well that you played so strongly upon the feelings of the  Mohawks at that test in the vale of Onondaga, Robert,&#8221; said Willet. &#8220;If  you had not said over and over again that the Quebec of the French was  once the Stadacona of the Mohawks they would not have been here tonight  to save us. They say that deeds speak louder than words, but when the  same man speaks with both words and deeds people have got to hear.&#8221;
  &#8220;You give me too much credit, Dave. The time was ripe for a Mohawk  attack upon the French.&#8221;
  &#8220;Aye, lad, but one had to see a chance and use it. Now, join all  those fellows in sleep. We won't move before noon.&#8221;
  But Robert's brain was too active for sleep just yet. While his  imaginative power made him see things before other people saw them, he  also continued to see them after they were gone. The wilderness battle  passed once more before him, and when he brushed his eyes to thrust it  away, he looked at the sleeping Mohawks and thought what splendid  savages they were. The other tribes of the Hodenosaunee were still  holding to their neutrality&#8212;all that was asked of them&#8212;but the  Mohawks, with the memories of their ancient wrongs burning in their  hearts, had openly taken the side of the English, and tonight their  valor and skill had undoubtedly saved the American force. Daganoweda  was a hero! And so was Tayoga, the Onondaga, always the first of red  men to Robert.
  His heated brain began to grow cool at last. The vivid pictures that  had been passing so fast before his eyes faded. He saw only reality,  the blazing fire, the dusky figures lying motionless before it, and the  circling wall of dark woods. Then he slept.
  Willet was the only white man who remained awake. He saw the great  fire die, and the dawn come in its place. He felt then for the first  time in all that long encounter the strangeness of his own position.  The wilderness, savages and forest battle had become natural to him,  and yet his life had once been far different. There was a taste of a  distant past in that fierce duel at Quebec when he slew the bravo,  Boucher, a deed for which he had never felt a moment's regret, and yet  when he balanced the old times against the present, he could not say  which had the advantage. He had found true friends in the woods, men  who would and did risk their own lives to save his.
  The dawn came swiftly, flooding the earth with light. Daganoweda and  many of the Mohawk warriors awoke, but the young Philadelphia captain  and his men slept on, plunged in the utter stupor of exhaustion.  Tayoga, who had made a supreme effort, both physical and mental, also  continued to sleep, and Robert, lying with his feet to the coals, never  stirred.
  Daganoweda shook himself, and, so shaking, shook the last shred of  sleep from his eyes. Then he looked with pride at his warriors, those  who yet lay upon the ground and those who had arisen. He was a young  chief, not yet thirty years of age, and he was the bloom and flower of  Mohawk courage and daring. His name, Daganoweda, the Inexhaustible, was  fully deserved, as his bravery and resource were unlimited. But unlike  Tayoga, he had in him none of the priestly quality. He had not drunk or  even sipped at the white man's civilization. The spirituality so often  to be found in the Onondagas was unknown to him. He was a warrior  first, last and all the time. He was Daganoweda of the Clan of the  Turtle, of the Nation Ganeagaono, the Keepers of the Eastern Gate, of  the great League of the Hodenosaunee, and he craved no glory save that  to be won in battle, which he craved all the time.
  Daganoweda, as he looked at his men, felt intense satisfaction,  because the achievement of his Mohawks the night before had been  brilliant and successful, but he concealed it from all save himself. It  was not for a chief who wished to win not one victory, but a hundred to  show undue elation. But he turned and for a few moments gazed directly  into the sun with unwinking eyes, and when he shifted his gaze away, a  great tide of life leaped in his veins.
  Then he gave silent thanks. Like all the other Indians in North  America the Mohawks personified and worshipped the sun, which to them  was the mighty Dweller in Heaven, almost the same as Manitou, a great  spirit to whom sacrifices and thanksgivings were to be made. The sun,  an immortal being, had risen that morning and from his seat in the  highest of the high heavens he had looked down with his invincible eye  which no man could face more than a few seconds, upon his favorite  children, the Mohawks, to whom he had given the victory. Daganoweda  bowed a head naturally haughty and under his breath murmured thanks for  the triumph given and prayers for others to come.
  The warriors built the fire anew and cooked their breakfasts. They  had venison and hominy of three kinds according to the corn of which it  was made,<I> Onaogaant</I> or the white corn,<I> Ticne</I> or the red  corn, and<I> Hagowa</I> or the white flint corn. They also had bear  meat and dried beans. So their breakfast was abundant, and they ate  with the appetite of warriors who had done mighty deeds.
  Daganoweda and Willet, as became great men, sat together on a log  and were served by a warrior who took honor from the task. Black Rifle  sat alone a little distance away. He would have been welcome in the  company of the Mohawk chief and the hunter, but, brooding and solitary  in mind, he wished to be alone and they knew and respected his wish.  Daganoweda glanced at him more than once as he remained in silence, and  always there was pity in his looks. And there was admiration too,  because Black Rifle was a great warrior. The woods held none greater.
  When Robert awoke it was well on toward noon and he sprang up,  refreshed and strong.
  &#8220;You've had quite a nap, Robert,&#8221; said Willet, who had not slept at  all, &#8220;but some of the soldiers are still sleeping, and Tayoga has just  gone down to the spring to bathe his face.&#8221;
  &#8220;Which I also will do,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;And when you come back food will be ready for you.&#8221;
  Robert found Tayoga at the spring, flexing his muscles, and taking  short steps back and forth. &#8220;It was a great run you made,&#8221; said the  white youth, &#8220;and it saved us. There's no stiffness, I hope?&#8221;
  &#8220;There was a little, Dagaeoga, but I have worked it out of my body.  Now all my muscles are as they were. I am ready to make another and  equal run.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's not needed, and for that I'm thankful. St. Luc will not come  back, nor will Tandakora, I think, linger in the woods, hoping for a  shot. He knows that the Mohawk skirmishers will be too vigilant.&#8221;
  As they went back to the fire for their food they heard a droning  song and the regular beat of feet. Some of the Mohawks were dancing the  Buffalo Dance, a dance named after an animal never found in their  country, but which they knew well. It was a tribute to the vast energy  and daring of the nations of the Hodenosaunee that they should range in  such remote regions as Kentucky and Tennessee and hunt the buffalo with  the Cherokees, who came up from the south.
  They called the dance Dageyagooanno, and it was always danced by men  only. One warrior beat upon the drum,<I> ganojoo</I>, and another used<I>  gusdawasa</I> or the rattle made of the shell of a squash. A dozen  warriors danced, and players and dancers alike sang. It was a most  singular dance and Robert, as he ate and drank, watched it with curious  interest.
  The warriors capered back and forth, and often they bent themselves  far over, until their hands touched the ground. Then they would arch  their backs, until they formed a kind of hump, and they leaped to and  fro, bellowing all the time. The imitation was that of a buffalo,  recognizable at once, and, while it was rude and monotonous, both  dancing and singing preserved a rhythm, and as one listened  continuously it soon crept into the blood. Robert, with that singular  temperament of his, so receptive to all impressions, began to feel it.  Their chant was of war and victory and he stirred to both. He was on  the warpath with them, and he passed with them through the thick of  battle.
  They danced for a long time, quitting only when exhaustion  compelled. By that time all the soldiers were awake and Captain Colden  talked with the other leaders, red and white. His instructions took him  farther west, where he was to build a fort for the defense of the  border, and, staunch and true, he did not mean to turn back because he  had been in desperate battle with the French and their Indian allies.
  &#8220;I was sent to protect a section of the frontier,&#8221; he said to  Willet, &#8220;and while I've found it hard to protect my men and myself, yet  I must go on. I could never return to Philadelphia and face our people  there.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's a just view you take, Captain Colden,&#8221; said Willet.
  &#8220;I feel, though, that my men and I are but children in the woods.  Yesterday and last night proved it. If you and your friends continue  with us our march may not be in vain.&#8221;
  Willet glanced at Robert, and then at Tayoga.
  &#8220;Ours for the present, at least, is a roving commission,&#8221; said young  Lennox. &#8220;It seems to me that the best we can do is to go with Captain  Colden.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not called back to the vale of Onondaga,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;I  would see the building of this fort that Captain Colden has planned.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then we three are agreed,&#8221; said the hunter. &#8220;It's best not to speak  to Black Rifle, because he'll follow his own notions anyway, and as for  Daganoweda and his Mohawks I think they're likely to resume their march  northward against the French border.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm grateful to you three,&#8221; said Captain Colden, &#8220;and, now that  it's settled, we'll start as soon as we can.&#8221;
  &#8220;Better give them all a good rest, and wait until the morning,&#8221; said  the hunter.
  Again Captain Colden agreed with him.
