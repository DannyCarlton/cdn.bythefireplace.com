  Abner Holden did not suspect that Herbert actually intended to  leave him  permanently; but when evening came, and he did not return,  he became  apprehensive that such was the case. Now, for more than one  reason, he  objected to our hero's leaving. First, because he was a  strong, capable  boy, and his services were worth considerable, and,  secondly, because he  disliked Herbert, and it was a satisfaction to  tyrannize over him, as  his position enabled him to do. There are some  men in whom the instinct  of petty tyranny exists to such an extent  that they cannot feel happy  without someone to exercise their  authority over. Such a man was Abner  Holden. He was a bully and a  tyrant by nature, and decidedly objected to  losing one so completely  in his power as Herbert was. 
  When night came and Herbert did not return, he decided to search  for  him, and bring him back, if found, the very next day. He did not  impart  his purpose to Mrs. Bickford, for he was at no loss to discover  that the  sympathies of the kind-hearted housekeeper were not with him,  but with  the boy whom he wished to abuse. When breakfast was over,  therefore, he  merely said: &quot;Mrs. Bickford, I am going out for a short  time. If Herbert  should return while I am absent, you may tell him to  finish hoeing those  potatoes in the garden.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you think he will come back, Mr. Holden?&quot; asked the  housekeeper. 
  &quot;Yes; he will soon be tired of wandering about. He will learn to  prize a  good home after he has slept out of doors one night.&quot; 
  Mrs. Bickford did not reply; but she did not feel quite so much   confidence as her employer appeared to do in the excellence of the  home  which Herbert had enjoyed under Abner Holden's roof. 
  &quot;It's just as well he doesn't suspect Herbert's plan,&quot; she thought,  and  without further words, began to clear away the breakfast dishes. 
  Abner was not long in deciding that Herbert was hidden in the  woods.  That, indeed, seemed the most natural place of refuge for one  placed in  his circumstances. He determined, therefore, to seek there  first. 
  We must now return to Herbert. 
  &quot;If you will wait till nightfall,&quot; said Ralph, &quot;you will be more  safe  from pursuit, and I will accompany you for a few miles.&quot; 
  This seemed plausible, and our hero consented. 
  Ralph went off on a hunting expedition, but Herbert remained  behind,  fearing that he might tear or stain his clothes, of which it  was  necessary, now, to be careful. How to pass the time was the  question. To  tell the truth, the hunter's cabin contained little that  would help him.  There were no books visible, for Ralph seemed to have  discarded  everything that would remind him of that civilization which  he had  forsaken in disgust. 
  Herbert went outside, and watched the squirrels that occasionally  made  their appearance flitting from branch to branch of the tall  trees. After  a while his attention was drawn to a bird, which flew  with something in  its beak nearly to the top of a tall tree not far  off. 
  &quot;I shouldn't wonder,&quot; thought Herbert, interested, &quot;if she's got a  nest,  and some young ones up there. I have a great mind to climb up  and see  whether she has or not.&quot; 
  He measured the tree with his eye. It was very tall, exceeding in  its  height most of its forest neighbors. 
  &quot;I don't know as I can climb it,&quot; he said to himself, a little   doubtfully; &quot;but anyway, I am going to try. There's nothing like   trying.&quot; 
  This was a lucky determination for Herbert, as will speedily  appear. 
  It was twenty feet to the first branching off, and this was, of  course,  the most difficult part of the ascent, since it was necessary  to &quot;shin  up,&quot; and the body of the tree was rather too large to clasp  comfortably.  However, it was not the first time that Herbert had  climbed a tree, and  he was not deficient in courage as well as skill.  So he pushed on his  way, and though once or twice in danger of  falling, he at length  succeeded in reaching the first bough. From this  point the ascent was  comparatively easy. 
  In a short time our hero was elated to find himself probably fifty  feet  from the ground, so high it made him feel a little dizzy to look  down.  He reached the nest, and found the young birds&#8212;three in number.  The  parent bird hovered near by, evidently quite alarmed for the  safety of  her brood. But Herbert had no intention of harming them. He  only climbed  up to gratify his curiosity, and because he had nothing  more important  to do. Though he did not know it, his own danger was  greater than that  which threatened the birds. For, just at that  moment, Mr. Holden, in his  wanderings, had reached Ralph's cabin, and  Herbert, looking down,  beheld, with some anxiety, the figure of the  unwelcome visitor. He saw  Abner enter the cabin, and, after a few  moments' interval, issue from it  with an air of disappointment and  dissatisfaction. 
  &quot;How lucky,&quot; thought our hero, &quot;that he did not find me inside!&quot; 
  Abner Holden looked about him in every direction but the right one.  He  little dreamed that the object of his pursuit was looking down upon  him,  securely, from above. 
  &quot;I don't think he'll find me,&quot; thought Herbert. &quot;Wouldn't he give   something, though, to know where I am?&quot; 
  But our young hero was doomed to disappointment. Just at that  moment&#8212;  the unluckiest that could have been selected&#8212;he was seized  with a  strong inclination to sneeze. 
  Alarmed lest the sound should betray him, he made desperate efforts  to  suppress it but Nature would have its way, and probably did so with   greater violence than if no resistance had been made. 
  &quot;Ker-chew!&quot; sneezed Herbert, violently. 
  As he anticipated, Abner's attention was attracted by the loud  noise,  which he rightly concluded could hardly proceed from a bird or  squirrel.  He had just been on the point of leaving the cabin for some  other part  of the woods, but at this sound he stood still. Looking up  to discover  whence it proceeded, his keen eyes detected Herbert in his  lofty perch.  His eyes sparkled with joy. 
  &quot;Ha, you young rascal!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;So you are there, are you?  You  were going to run away, were you?&quot; 
  Now that Herbert was actually discovered, his fear left him, and he   became perfectly self-possessed and confident. 
  &quot;Yes, Mr. Holden,&quot; he answered, quietly; &quot;such is my intention.&quot; 
  &quot;Boldly spoken,&quot; said Abner, provoked by our hero's coolness, for  he had  hoped to find him terrified and pleading for forgiveness. &quot;I  admire your  frankness, and will try to equal it. I suppose you'll give  it up as a  bad job now.&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir,&quot; said Herbert, firmly. 
  &quot;Take care, sir,&quot; said Abner, in anger and astonishment. &quot;Take care  how  you defy me. Come down here at once.&quot; 
  &quot;What for?&quot; inquired Herbert, without stirring. 
  &quot;What for?&quot; repeated Abner Holden. &quot;That I may flog you within an  inch  of your life.&quot; 
  &quot;That's no inducement,&quot; said our hero, coolly. 
  &quot;Do you refuse to obey me?&quot; shouted Abner, stamping angrily. 
  &quot;I refuse to be flogged. You don't get me down for any such  purpose, Mr.  Holden.&quot; 
  &quot;Then, by Heaven, if you won't come otherwise, I'll come up and  help you  down.&quot; 
  The angry man at once commenced the ascent. Anger gave him  strength,  and, though he was unaccustomed to climbing, he continued to  mount up  about halfway to the first branching off, somewhat to  Herbert's  uneasiness, for he felt there was a chance that he might  fall into  Abner's clutches. 
  But Abner's success was only temporary. At the height of a dozen  feet he  began to slip, and, despite his frantic struggles, he slid  gradually to  the ground, tearing his coat, which he had not taken the  precaution to  remove, and blistering his hands. 
  What was to be done? 
  In his anger and excitement, he drew a pistol from his breast  pocket,  and pointed upward, saying menacingly, &quot;Come down at once, you  young  rascal, or I will fire!&quot; 
  Herbert was startled. He did not believe the pistol to be loaded.  Still  it might be. 
  &quot;Will you come down?&quot; repeated Abner, fiercely. &quot;Quick, or I fire.&quot; 
  Herbert's cheek was pale, but in a resolute voice he answered, &quot;I  will  not.&quot; 
  Abner Holder, laid his finger upon the trigger, and would, in his  anger,  have carried his threat into execution; but at the critical  moment he  was conscious of a violent blow, and the pistol was wrenched  from his  hand. 
  Turning quickly, he met the stern glance of Ralph the Ranger.
