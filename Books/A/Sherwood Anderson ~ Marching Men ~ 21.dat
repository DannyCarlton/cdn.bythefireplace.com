Margaret Ormsby was a natural product of her age and of American  social life in our times. As an individual she was lovely. Although  her father David Ormsby the plough king had come up to his position  and his wealth out of obscurity and poverty and had known during his  early life what it was to stand face to face with defeat, he had made  it his business to see that his daughter had no such experience. The  girl had been sent to Vassar, she had been taught to catch the fine  distinction between clothes that are quietly and beautifully expensive  and clothes that merely look expensive, she knew how to enter a room  and how to leave a room and had also a strong well trained body and an  active mind. Added to these things she had, without the least  knowledge of life, a vigorous and rather high handed confidence in her  ability to meet life.    
During the years spent in the eastern college Margaret had made up her  mind that whatever happened she was not going to let her life be dull  or uninteresting. Once when a girl friend from Chicago came to the  college to visit her the two went for a day out of doors and sat down  upon a hillside to talk things over. "We women have been fools,"  Margaret had declared. "If Father and Mother think that I am going to  come home and marry some stick of a man they are mistaken. I have  learned to smoke cigarettes and have had my share of a bottle of wine.  That may not mean anything to you. I do not think it amounts to much  either but it expresses something. It fairly makes me ill when I think  of how men have always patronised women. They want to keep evil things  away from us--Bah! I am sick of that idea and a lot of the other girls  here feel the same way. What right have they? I suppose some day some  little whiffit of a business man will set himself up to take care of  me. He had better not. I tell you there is a new kind of women growing  up and I am going to be one of them. I am going to adventure, to taste  life strongly and deeply. Father and Mother might as well make up  their minds to that."    
The excited girl had walked up and down before her companion, a mild  looking young woman with blue eyes, and had raised her hands above her  head as though to strike a blow. Her body was like the body of a fine  young animal standing alert to meet an enemy and her eyes reflected  the intoxication of her mood. "I want all of life," she cried; "I want  the lust and the strength and the evil of it. I want to be one of the  new women, the saviours of our sex."    
Between David Ormsby and his daughter there was an unusual bond. Six  foot three, blue eyed, broad shouldered, his presence had a strength  and dignity which marked him out among men and the daughter sensed his  strength. She was right in that. In his way the man was inspired.  Under his eye the trivialities of plough-making had become the details  of a fine art. In the factory he never lost the air of command which  inspires confidence. Foremen running into the office filled with  excitement because of a break in the machinery or an accident to a  workman returned to do his bidding quietly and efficiently. Salesmen  going from village to village to sell ploughs became under his  influence filled with the zeal of missionaries carrying the gospel to  the unenlightened. Stockholders of the plough company rushing to him  with rumours of coming business disaster stayed to write checks for  new assessments on their stock. He was a man who gave men back their  faith in business and their faith in men.    
To David plough-making was an end in life. Like other men of his type  he had other interests but they were secondary. In secret he thought  of himself as capable of a broader culture than most of his daily  associates and without letting it interfere with his efficiency tried  to keep in touch with the thoughts and movements of the world by  reading. After the longest and hardest day in the office he sometimes  spent half the night over a book in his room.    
As Margaret Ormsby grew into womanhood she was a constant source of  anxiety to her father. To him it seemed that she had passed from an  awkward and rather jolly girlhood into a peculiarly determined new  kind of womanhood over night. Her adventurous spirit worried him. One  day he had sat in his office reading a letter announcing her  homecoming. The letter seemed no more than a characteristic outburst  from an impulsive girl who had but yesterday fallen asleep at evening  in his arms. It confused him to think that an honest ploughmaker  should have a letter from his little girl talking of the kind of  living that he believed could only lead a woman to destruction.    
And then the next day there sat beside him at his table a new and  commanding figure demanding his attention. David got up from the table  and hurried away to his room. He wanted to readjust his thoughts. On  his desk was a photograph brought home by the daughter from school. He  had the common experience of being told by the photograph what he had  been trying to grasp. Instead of a wife and child there were two women  in the house with him.    
Margaret had come out of college a thing of beauty in face and figure.  Her tall straight well-trained body, her coal-black hair, her soft  brown eyes, the air she had of being prepared for life's challenge  caught and held the attention of men. There was in the girl something  of her father's bigness and not a little of the secret blind desires  of her mother. To an attentive household on the night of her arrival  she announced her intention of living her life fully and vividly. "I  am going to know things I can not get from books," she said. "I am  going to touch life at many corners, getting the taste of things in my  mouth. You thought me a child when I wrote home saying that I wouldn't  be cooped up in the house and married to a tenor in the church choir  or to an empty-headed young business man but now you are going to see.  I am going to pay the price if necessary, but I am going to live."    
In Chicago Margaret set about the business of living as though nothing  were needed but strength and energy. In a characteristic American way  she tried to hustle life. When the men in her own set looked confused  and shocked by the opinions she expressed she got out of her set and  made the common mistake of supposing that those who do not work and  who talk rather glibly of art and of freedom are by that token free  men and artists.    
Still she loved and respected her father. The strength in him made an  appeal to the native strong-thing in her. To a young socialist writer  who lived in the settlement house where she presently went to live and  who sought her out to sit by her desk berating men of wealth and  position she showed the quality of her ideals by pointing to David  Ormsby. "My father, the leader of an industrial trust, is a better man  than all of the noisy reformers that ever lived," she declared. "He  makes ploughs anyway--makes them well--millions of them. He does not  spend his time talking and running his ringers through his hair. He  works and his work has lightened the labours of millions while the  talkers sit thinking noisy thoughts and getting round-shouldered."    
In truth Margaret Ormsby was puzzled. Had she been allowed by a common  fellowship in living to be a real sister to all other women and to  know their common heritage of defeat, had she like her father when he  was a boy but known what it was to walk utterly broken and beaten in  the face of men and then to rise again and again to battle with life  she would have been splendid.    
She did not know. To her mind any kind of defeat had in it a touch of  something like immorality. When she saw all about her only a vast mob  of defeated and confused human beings trying to make headway in the  midst of a confused social organisation she was beside herself with  impatience.    
The distraught girl turned to her father and tried to get hold of the  keynote of his life; "I want you to tell me things," she said, but the  father not understanding only shook his head. It did not occur to him  to talk to her as to a fine man friend and a kind of bantering half  serious companionship sprang up between them. The ploughmaker was  happy in the thought that the jolly girl he had known before his  daughter went to college had come back to live with him.    
After Margaret went to the settlement house she lunched with her  father almost every day. The hour together in the midst of the din  that filled their lives became for them both a treasured privilege.  Day after day they sat for an hour in a fashionable down-town eating  place renewing and strengthening their comradeship, laughing and  talking amid the crowds, delightful in their intimacy. With each other  they playfully took on the air of the two men of affairs, each in turn  treating the work of the other as something to be passed over lightly.  Secretly neither believed as he talked.    
In her effort to get hold of and move the sordid human wrecks floating  in and out of the door of the settlement house Margaret thought of her  father at his desk directing the making of ploughs. "It is clean and  important work," she thought. "He is a big and effective man."    
At his desk in the office of the plough trust David thought of his  daughter in the settlement house at the edge of the First Ward. "She  is a white shining thing amid dirt and ugliness," he thought "Her  whole life is like the life of her mother during the hours when she  once lay bravely facing death for the sake of a new life."    
On the day of her meeting with McGregor, father and daughter sat as  usual in the restaurant. Men and women passed up and down the long  carpeted aisles and looked at them admiringly. A waiter stood at  Ormsby's shoulder anxious for the generous tip. Into the air that hung  over them, the little secret atmosphere of comradeship they cherished  so carefully, was thrust the sense of a new personality. Floating in  Margaret's mind beside the quiet noble face of her father, with its  stamp of ability and kindliness, was another face--the face of the man  who had talked to her in the settlement house, not as Margaret Ormsby  daughter of David Ormsby of the plough trust but as a woman who could  serve his ends and whom he meant should serve. The vision in her mind  haunted her and she listened indifferently to the talk of her father.  She felt that the stern face of the young lawyer with its strong mouth  and its air of command was as something impending and tried to get  back the feeling of dislike she had felt when first he thrust himself  in at the settlement house door. She succeeded only in recalling  certain firm lines of purpose that offset and tempered the brutality  of his face.    
Sitting there in the restaurant opposite her father, where day after  day they had tried so hard to build a real partnership in existence,  Margaret suddenly burst into tears.    
"I have met a man who has compelled me to do what I did not want to  do," she explained to the astonished man and then smiled at him  through the tears that glistened in her eyes.
