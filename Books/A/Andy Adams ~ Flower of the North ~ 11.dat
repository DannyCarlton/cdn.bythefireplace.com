  Philip and Jeanne stood face to face in the firelight. 
  &quot;Quick!&quot; he cried. &quot;We must hurry!&quot; 
  He bent over to pick up his revolver from the ground. His movement   was followed by a low sob of pain. Jeanne was swaying as though  about  to faint. She fell in a crumpled heap before he could reach  her side. 
  &quot;You are hurt!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Jeanne! Jeanne!&quot; 
  He was upon his knees beside her, crying out her name, half   holding her in his arms. 
  &quot;No, no! I am not hurt&#8212;much,&quot; she replied, trying to recover   herself. &quot;It is my ankle. I sprained it&#8212;on the cliff. Now&#8212;&quot; 
  She became heavier against his arm. Her eyes were limpid with   pain. 
  Rising, Philip caught her in his arms. The crashing of brush was   within pistol-shot distance of them, but in that moment he felt no   fear. Life leaped back into his veins. He wanted to shout back his   defiance as he ran with Jeanne along the path to the river. He  could  feel her pulsing against him. His lips were in her hair. Her  heart was  beating wildly against his own. One of her arms was  about his  shoulder, her hand against his neck. Life, love, the joy  of possession  swept through him in burning floods, and it seemed  in these first  moments of his contact with Jeanne, in the first  sound of her voice  speaking to him, that the passionate language  of his soul must escape  through his lips. For this moment he had  risked his life, had taken a  hundred chances; he had anticipated,  and yet he had not dreamed beyond  a hundredth part of what it  would mean for him. He looked down into  the white face of the girl  as he ran. Her beautiful eyes were open to  him. Her lips were  parted; her cheek lay against his breast. He did  not realize how  close he was holding her until, at last, he stopped  where he had  hidden the canoe. Then he felt her beating and throbbing  against  him, as he had felt the quivering life of a frightened bird   imprisoned in his hands. She drew a deep breath when he opened his   arms, and lifted her head. Her loose hair swept over his breast  and  hands. 
  He spoke no word as he placed her in the canoe. Not a whisper   passed between them as the canoe sped swiftly from the shore. A   hundred yards down the stream Philip headed straight across the  river  and plunged into the shadows along the opposite bank. 
  Jeanne was close to him. He could hear her breathing. Suddenly he   felt the touch of her hand. 
  &quot;M'sieur, I must ask&#8212;about Pierre!&quot; 
  There was the thrill of fear in the low words. She leaned back,   her face a pale shadow in the deep gloom; and Philip bent over  until  he felt her breath, and the sweetness of her hair filled his  nostrils.  Quickly he whispered what had happened. He told her that  Pierre was  hurt, but not badly, and that he had promised to take  her on to Fort  o' God. 
  &quot;It is up the Churchill?&quot; he questioned. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered. 
  They heard voices now, and almost opposite them they saw shadowy   figures running out to the canoes upon the sand-bar. 
  &quot;They will think that we are escaping toward Churchill,&quot; said   Philip, gloatingly. &quot;It is the nearest refuge. See&#8212;&quot; 
  One of the canoes was launched, and shot swiftly down the river. A   moment later the second followed. The dip of paddles died away,  and  Philip laughed softly and joyously. 
  &quot;They will hunt for us from now until morning between here and the   Bay. And then they will look for you again in Churchill.&quot; 
  Philip was conscious, almost without seeing, that Jeanne had bowed   her head in her arms and that she was giving way now to the  terrific  strain which she had been under. Not until he heard a low  sob, which  she strove hard to choke back in her throat, did he  dare to lean over  again and touch her. Whatever was throbbing in  his heart, he knew that  he must hide it now. 
  &quot;You read the letter?&quot; he asked, softly. 
  &quot;Yes, M'sieur.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you know&#8212;that you are safe with me!&quot; 
  There was pride and strength, the ring of triumph in his voice. It   was the voice of a man thrilled by his own strength, by the warmth  of  a great love, by the knowledge that he was the protector of a  creature  dearer to him than all else on earth. The truth of it set  Jeanne  quivering. She reached out until in the darkness her two  hands found  one of Philip's, and for a moment she held his paddle  motionless in  midair. 
  &quot;Thank you, M'sieur,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I trust you, as I would   trust Pierre.&quot; 
  All the words that women had ever spoken to him were as nothing to   those few that fell softly from Jeanne's lips; in the clinging   pressure of her fingers as she uttered them were the concentrated   joys of all that he had dreamed of in the touch of women. He knelt   silent, motionless, until her hands left his own. 
  &quot;I am to take you to Fort o' God,&quot; he said, fighting to keep the   tremble of joy out of his voice. &quot;And you&#8212;you must guide me.&quot; 
  &quot;It is far up the Churchill,&quot; she replied, understanding the   question he intended. &quot;It is two hundred miles from the Bay.&quot; 
  He put his strength into his paddle for ten minutes, and then ran   the canoe into shore fully half a mile above the sand-bar. He  stepped  out into water up to his knees. 
  &quot;We must risk a little time here to attend to your injured ankle,&quot;   he explained. &quot;Then you can arrange yourself comfortably among  these  robes in the bow. Shall I carry you?&quot; 
  &quot;You can&#8212;help,&quot; said Jeanne. She gave him her hand and made an   effort to rise. Instantly she sank back with a sob of pain. 
  It was strange that her pain should fill him with a wonderful joy.   He knew that she was suffering, that she could not walk or stand   alone. And yet, back at the camp, she had risen in her torture and   had come to his rescue. She could not bear her own weight now, but   then she had run to him and had fought for him. The knowledge that   she had done this, and for him, filled him with an exquisite   sensation. 
  &quot;I must carry you,&quot; he said, speaking to her with the calm   decision that he might have voiced to a little child. His tone   reassured her, and she made no remonstrance when he lifted her in  his  arms. For a brief moment she lay against him again, and when  he  lowered her upon the bank his hand accidentally touched the  soft  warmth of her face. 
  &quot;My specialty is sprains,&quot; he said, speaking a little lightly to   raise her spirits for the instant's ordeal through which she must   pass. &quot;I have doctored half a dozen during the last three months.  You  must take off your moccasin and your stocking, and I will make  a  bandage.&quot; 
  He drew a big handkerchief from his pocket and dipped it in the   water. Then he searched along the shore for a dozen paces, until  he  found an Indian willow. With his knife he scraped off a handful  of  bark, soaked it in water, crushed it between his hands, and  returned  to her. Jeanne's little foot lay naked in the starlight. 
  &quot;It will hurt just a moment,&quot; he said, gently. &quot;But it is the only   cure. To-morrow it will be strong enough for you to stand upon.  Can  you bear a little hurt?&quot; 
  He knelt before her and looked up, scarce daring to touch her foot   before she spoke. 
  &quot;I may cry,&quot; she said. 
  Her voice fluttered, but it gave him permission. He folded the wet   handkerchief in the form of a bandage, with the willow bark spread   over it. Then, very gently, he seized her foot in one hand and her   ankle in the other. 
  &quot;It will hurt just a little,&quot; he soothed. &quot;Only a moment.&quot; 
  His fingers tightened. He put into them the whole strength of his   grip, pulling downward on the foot and upward on the ankle until,   with a low cry, Jeanne flung her hands over his. 
  &quot;There, it is done,&quot; he laughed, nervously. He wrapped the bandage   around so tightly that Jeanne could not move her foot, and tied it   with strips of cloth. Then he turned to the canoe while she drew  on  her stocking and moccasin. 
  He was trembling. A maddening joy pounded in his brain. Jeanne's   voice came to him sweetly, with a shyness in it that made him feel   like a boy. He was glad that the night concealed his face. He  would  have given worlds to have seen Jeanne's. 
  &quot;I am ready,&quot; she said. 
  He carried her to the bow of the canoe and fixed her among the   robes, arranging a place for her head so that she might sleep if  she  wished. For the first time the light was so that he could see  her  plainly as she nestled back in the place made for her. Their  eyes met  for a moment. 
  &quot;You must sleep,&quot; he urged. &quot;I shall paddle all night.&quot; 
  &quot;You are sure that Pierre is not badly hurt?&quot; she asked,   tremulously. &quot;You&#8212;you would not&#8212;keep the truth from me?&quot; 
  &quot;He was not more than stunned,&quot; assured Philip. &quot;It is impossible   that his wound should prove serious. Only there was no time to  lose,  and I came without him. He will follow us soon.&quot; 
  He took his position in the stern, and Jeanne lay back among the   bearskins. For a long time after that Philip paddled in silence.  He  had hoped that Jeanne would give him an opportunity to continue  their  conversation, in spite of his advice to her to secure what  rest she  could. But there came no promise from the bow of the  canoe. After half  an hour he guessed that Jeanne had taken him at  his word, and was  asleep. 
  It was disappointing, and yet there came a pleasurable throb with   his disappointment. Jeanne trusted him. She was sleeping under his   protection as sweetly as a child. Fear of her enemies no longer  kept  her awake or filled her with terror. This night, under these  stars,  with the wilderness all about them, she had given herself  into his  keeping. His cheeks burned. He dipped his paddle  noiselessly, so that  he might not interrupt her slumber. Each  moment added to the fullness  of his joy, and he wished that he  might only see her face, hidden in  the darkness of her hair and  the bear-robes. 
  The silence no longer seemed a silence to him. It was filled with   the beating of his heart, the singing of his love, a gentle sigh  now  and then that came like a deeper breath between Jeanne's sweet  lips.  It was a silence that pulsated with a voiceless and  intoxicating life  for him, and he was happy. In these moments,  when even their voices  were stilled, Jeanne belonged to him, and  to him alone. He could feel  the warmth of her presence. He felt  still the thrill of her breast  against his own, the touch of her  hair upon his lips, the gentle  clinging of her arms. The spirit of  her moved, and sat awake, and  talked with him, just as the old  spirit of his dreams had communed  with him a thousand times in his  loneliness. Dreams were at an end.  Now had come reality. 
  He looked up into the sky. The moon had dropped below the   southwestern forests, and there were only the stars above him,   filling a gray-blue vault in which there was not even the  lingering  mist of a cloud. It was a beautifully clear night, and  he wondered how  the light fell so that it did not reveal Jeanne in  her nest. The  thought that came to him then set his heart tingling  and made his face  radiant. Even the stars were guarding Jeanne,  and refused to disclose  the mystery of her slumber. He laughed  within himself. His being  throbbed, and suddenly a voice seemed to  cry softly, trembling in its  joy: 
  &quot;Jeanne! Jeanne! My beloved Jeanne!&quot; 
  With horror Philip caught himself too late. He had spoken the   words aloud. For an instant reality had transformed itself into  the  old dream, and his dream-spirit had called to its mate for the  first  time in words. Appalled at what he had said, Philip bent  over and  listened. He heard Jeanne's breathing. It was deeper than  before. She  was surely asleep! 
  He straightened himself and resumed his paddling. He was glad now   that he had spoken. Jeanne seemed nearer to him after those words. 
  Before this night he never realized how beautiful the wilderness   was, how complete it could be. It had offered him visions of new   life, but these visions had never quite shut out the memories of  old  pain. He watched and listened. The water rippled behind his  canoe; it  trickled in a soothing cadence after each dip of his  paddle; he heard  the gentle murmur of it among the reeds and  grasses, and now and then  the gurgling laughter of it, like the  faintest tinkling of dainty  bells. He had never understood it  before; he had never joined in its  happiness. The night sounds  came to him with a different meaning,  filled him with different  sensations. As he slipped quietly around a  bend in the river he  heard a splashing ahead of him, and knew that a  moose was feeding,  belly-deep, in the water. At other times the sound  would have set  his fingers itching for a rifle, but now it was a part  of the  music of the night. Later he heard the crashing of a heavy body   along the shore and in the distance the lonely howl of a wolf. He   listened to the sounds with a quiet pleasure instead of creeping   thrills which they once sent through him. Every sound spoke of   Jeanne&#8212;of Jeanne and her world, into which each stroke of his  paddle  carried them a little deeper. 
  And yet the truth could not but come to him that Jeanne was but a   stranger. She was a creature of mystery, as she lay there asleep  in  the bow of the canoe; he loved her, and yet he did not know  her. He  confessed to himself, as the night lengthened, that he  would be glad  when morning came. Jeanne would clear up a half of  his perplexities  then, perhaps all of them. He would at least  learn more about herself  and the reason for the attack at Fort  Churchill. 
  He paddled for another hour, and then looked at his watch by the   light of a match. It was three o'clock. 
  Jeanne had not moved, but as the match burned out between his   fingers she startled him by speaking. 
  &quot;Is it nearly morning, M'sieur?&quot; 
  &quot;An hour until dawn,&quot; said Philip. &quot;You have been sleeping a long   time&#8212;&quot; Her name was on his lips, but he found it a little more   difficult to speak now. And yet there was a gentleness in Jeanne's   &quot;M'SIEUR&quot; which encouraged him. &quot;Are you getting hungry?&quot; he  asked. 
  &quot;Pierre and my father always ask me that when THEY are starving,&quot;   replied Jeanne, sitting erect in her nest so that Philip saw her  face  and the shimmer of her hair. &quot;There is everything to eat in  the pack,  M'sieur Philip, even to a bottle of olives.&quot; 
  &quot;Good!&quot; cried Philip, delighted, &quot;But won't you please cut out   that 'm'sieur?' My greatest weakness is a desire to be called by  my  first name. Will you?&quot; 
  &quot;If it pleases you,&quot; said Jeanne. &quot;There is everything there to   eat, and I will make you a cup of coffee, M'sieur&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;What?&quot; 
  &quot;Philip.&quot; 
  There was a ripple of laughter in the girl's voice. Philip fairly   trembled. 
  &quot;You were prepared for this journey,&quot; he said. &quot;You were going to   leave after you saw me on the rock. I have been wondering why&#8212;why   you took enough interest in me&#8212;&quot; 
  He knew that he was blundering, and in the darkness his face   turned red. Jeanne's tact was delightful. 
  &quot;We were curious about you,&quot; she said, with bewitching candor.   &quot;Pierre is the most inquisitive creature in the world, and I  wanted  to thank you for returning my handkerchief. I'm sorry you  didn't find  a bit of lace which I lost at the same time!&quot; 
  &quot;I did!&quot; exclaimed Philip. 
  He bit his tongue, and cursed himself at this fresh break. Jeanne   was silent. After a moment she said: 
  &quot;Shall I make you some coffee?&quot; 
  &quot;Will you be able to do it? Your foot&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I had forgotten that,&quot; she said. &quot;It doesn't hurt any more. But I   can show you how.&quot; 
  Her unaffected ingenuousness, the sweetness of her voice, the   simplicity and ease of her manner delighted Philip, and at the  same  time filled him with amazement. He had never met a forest  girl like  Jeanne. Her beauty, her queen-like bearing, when she had  stood with  Pierre on the rock, had puzzled him and filled him with  admiration.  But now her voice, the music of her words, her  quickness of perception  added tenfold to those impressions. It  might have been Miss Brokaw who  was sitting there in the bow  talking to him, only Jeanne's voice was  sweeter than Miss  Brokaw's; and even in the lightest of the words she  had spoken  there was a tone of sincerity and truth. It flashed upon  Philip  that Jeanne might have stepped from a convent school, where  gentle  voices had taught her and language was formed in the ripe  fullness  of music. In a moment he believed that something like this  had  happened. 
  &quot;We will go ashore,&quot; he said, searching for an open space. &quot;This   must be tedious to you, if you are not accustomed to it.&quot; 
  &quot;Accustomed to it, M'sieur&#8212;Philip!&quot; exclaimed Jeanne, catching   herself. &quot;I was born here!&quot; 
  &quot;In the wilderness?&quot; 
  &quot;At Fort o' God.&quot; 
  &quot;You have not always lived there?&quot; 
  For a brief space Jeanne was silent. 
  &quot;Yes, always, M'sieur. I am eighteen years old, and this is the   first time that I have ever seen what you people call  civilization.  It is my first visit to Fort Churchill. It is the  first time I have  ever been away from Fort o' God.&quot; 
  Jeanne's voice was low and subdued. It rang with truth. In it   there was something that was almost tragedy. For a breath or two   Philip's heart seemed to stop its beating, and he leaned far over,   looking straight and questioningly into the beautiful face that  met  his own. In that moment the world had opened and engulfed him  in a  wonder which at first his mind could not comprehend.
