  Philip knew that Jeanne was watching him as he lifted the coffee   from the fire and placed the pot on the ground to cool. His mind  was  in a hopeless tangle&#8212;a riot of things he would like to say,  throbbing  with a hundred questions he would like to ask, one after  another. And  yet Jeanne seemed bewitchingly unconscious of his  uneasiness. Not one  of his references to names and events so vital  to himself had in any  way produced a change in her. Was she, after  all, innocent of all  knowledge in the things he wished to know?  Was it possible that she  was entirely ignorant as to the identity  of the men who had attacked  Pierre and herself on the cliff? Was  it true that she did not know  Eileen Brokaw, that she had never  heard of Lord Fitzhugh Lee, and that  she had always lived among  the wild people of the north? By what  miracle performed here in  the heart of a savage world could this girl  talk to him in German  and Latin? Was she making fun of him? He turned  to look at her and  found her dark, clear eyes upon him. She smiled at  him in a tired  little way, and he saw nothing but sweetness and truth  in her  face. In an instant every suspicion was swept away. He felt  like a  criminal for having doubted her; and for a moment he was on the   point of confessing to her what had been in his thoughts. He   restrained himself, and went to the river to wash the pot-black  from  his hands. Jeanne was a mystery to him, a mystery that  delighted him  and filled him each moment with a deeper love. He  saw the life and  freedom of the forests in her every movement&#8212;in  the gesture of her  hands, the bird-like poise of her pretty head,  the lithe grace of her  slender body. She breathed the forests. It  glowed in her eyes, in the  rich red of her lips, and revealed its  beauty and strength in the  unconfined wealth of her gold-brown  hair. In a dozen ways he could see  her primitiveness, her kinship  to the wilderness. She had told him the  truth. Her eyes smiled  truth at him as he came up the bank. No other  woman's eyes had  ever looked at him like hers; none had he seen so  beautiful. And  yet in them he saw nothing that she would not have  expressed in  words&#8212;companionship, trust, thankfulness that he was  there to  care for her. Such eyes as those belonged only to the  wilderness,  brimming with the flawless beauty of an undefiled nature.  He had  seen them, but not so beautiful, in Cree women. He thought of   Eileen Brokaw's eyes as he looked at Jeanne's. They were very   beautiful, but they were DIFFERENT. Jeanne's could not lie. 
  On a white napkin Jeanne had spread out cold meat, bread, pickles,   and cheese, and Philip brought her the coffee. He noticed that she   was resting a little of her weight upon her injured ankle. 
  &quot;Better?&quot; he asked, indicating the bandaged ankle with a nod of   his head. 
  &quot;Much,&quot; replied Jeanne, as tersely. &quot;I'm going to try standing   upon it in a few minutes. But not now. I'm starved.&quot; 
  She gave him his coffee and began eating with a relish that made   him want to sit back and watch her. Instead, he joined her; and  they  ate like two hungry children. It was when she turned him out  a second  cup of coffee that Philip noticed her hand tremble a  little. 
  &quot;If Pierre was here we would be quite happy, M'sieur Philip,&quot; she   said, uneasily. &quot;I can't understand why he asked you to run away  with  me to Fort o' God. If he is not badly hurt, as you have told  me, why  do we not hide and wait for him? He would overtake us  to-morrow.&quot; 
  &quot;There&#8212;there was no time to talk over plans,&quot; answered Philip,   inwardly embarrassed for a moment by the unexpectedness of  Jeanne's  question. A vision of Pierre, bleeding and unconscious on  the cliff,  leaped into his mind, and the thought that he had lied  to Jeanne and  must still make her believe what was half false  sickened him. There  was, after all, a chance that Pierre would  never again come up the  Churchill. &quot;Perhaps Pierre thought we  would be hotly pursued,&quot; he went  on, seeing no escape from the  demand in the girl's eyes. &quot;In that  event it would be best for me  to get you to Fort o' God as quickly as  possible. You must  remember that Pierre was thinking of you. He can  care for himself.  It may take him two or three days to get back the  strength of&#8212;of  his arm,&quot; he finished, blindly. 
  &quot;He was wounded in the arm?&quot; 
  &quot;And on the head,&quot; said Philip. &quot;It was only a scalp wound,   however&#8212;nothing at all, except that it dazed him a little at the   time.&quot; 
  Jeanne pointed to the reflection of the fire on the river. 
  &quot;If we should be pursued?&quot; she suggested. 
  &quot;There is no danger,&quot; assured Philip, though he had left the flap   of his revolver holster unbuttoned. &quot;They will search for us  between  their camp and Churchill.&quot; 
  &quot;Citius venit periculum cum contemnitur,&quot; remonstrated Jeanne,   half smiling. 
  She was pale, but Philip saw that she was making a tremendous   effort to appear brave and cheerful. 
  &quot;Perhaps you are right,&quot; laughed Philip, &quot;but I swear that I don't   know what you mean. I suppose you picked that lingo up among the   Indians.&quot; 
  He caught the faintest gleam of Jeanne's white teeth again as she   bent her head. 
  &quot;I have a tutor at home,&quot; she explained, softly. &quot;You shall meet   him when we reach Fort o' God. He is the most wonderful man in the   world.&quot; 
  Her words sent a strange chill through Philip. They were filled   with an exquisite tenderness, a pride that sent her eyes back to  his,  glowing. The questions that he had meant to ask died and  faded away.  He thought of her words of a few minutes before, when  he had asked  about Fort o' God. She had said, &quot;My father, Pierre,  and I, WITH ONE  OTHER, live there alone.&quot; The OTHER was the tutor,  the man who had  come from civilization to teach this beautiful  girl those things which  had amazed him, and this man was THE MOST  WONDERFUL MAN IN THE WORLD.  He had no excuse for the feelings  which were aroused in him. Only he  knew, as he rose to his feet,  that a part of his old burden seemed  suddenly to have returned to  his shoulders, and the old loneliness was  beating at the door of  his heart. He rearranged the pack in silence,  and the strength and  joy of life were gone from his arms when he  helped Jeanne back to  her place among the bear-skins. He did not  notice that her eyes  were watching him curiously, or that her lips  trembled once or  twice, as if about to speak words which never came.  Jeanne, as  well as he, seemed to have discovered something which  neither  dared to reveal in that last five minutes on the shore. 
  &quot;There is one thing that I must know,&quot; said Philip, when they were   about to start, &quot;and that is where to find Fort o' God? Is it on  the  Churchill?&quot; 
  &quot;It is on the Little Churchill, M'sieur, near Waskiaowaka Lake.&quot; 
  Darkness concealed the effect of her words upon Philip. For a   moment he stared like one struck dumb. He stifled the exclamation   that rose to his lips. He felt himself trembling. He knew that if  he  spoke his voice would betray him. 
  NEAR WASKIAOWAKA LAKE! And Waskiaowaka was within thirty miles of   his own camp on the Blind Indian! If a bomb had burst under his  feet  he could not have been more amazed than at this information,  given to  him in Jeanne's quiet voice. Fort o' God&#8212;within thirty  miles of the  scene where very soon he was to fight the great  battle of his life! He  dug his paddle into the water and sent the  canoe hissing up the river.  His blood pounded like that of a  racehorse on the home-stretch. Of all  the things that had  happened, of all he had learned, this was the most  significant.  Every thought ran like a separate powder-flash to a  single idea,  to one great, overpowering question. Were Fort o' God and  its  people the key to the plot against himself and his company? Was it   the rendezvous of those who were striving to work his ruin? Doubt,   suspicion, almost belief came to him in those few moments, in  spite  of himself. 
  He looked at Jeanne. The gray dawn was breaking, and now light   followed swiftly and dissolved the last mist. In the chill of  early  morning, when with the approach of the sun a cold,  uncomfortable sweat  rises heavily from the earth and water, Jeanne  had drawn one of the  bearskins closely about her. Her head was  bare. Her hair, glistening  with damp, clung in heavy masses about  her face. There was a  bewitching childishness about her, a  pathetic appeal to him in the  forlorn little picture she made&#8212;so  helpless, and yet so confident in  him. Every energy in him leaped  up in defiance of the revolution which  for a few moments had  stirred within him. And Jeanne, as though she  had read the working  of his mind, looked straight at him and smiled,  with a little  purring note in her throat that took the place of a  thousand  words. It was such a smile, and yet not one of love, which  puts  the strength of ten men in one man's arms; and Philip laughed  back  at her, every chord in his body responding in joyous vibration to   the delicate note that had come with it. No matter what events  might  find their birth at Fort o' God, Jeanne was innocent of all  knowledge  of plot or wrong-doing. Once for all Philip convinced  himself of this. 
  The thought that came to him, as he looked at Jeanne, found voice   through his lips. 
  &quot;Do you know,&quot; he said, &quot;if I never saw you again I would always   have three pictures of you in my memory. I would never forget how  you  looked when I first saw you on the cliff&#8212;or as I see you now,  wrapped  in your bearskins. Only&#8212;I would think of you&#8212;as you  smiled.&quot; 
  &quot;And the third picture?&quot; questioned Jeanne, little guessing what   was in his mind. &quot;Would that be at the fire, when I burned the bad   man's neck&#8212;or&#8212;or when&#8212;&quot; 
  She stopped herself, and pouted her mouth in sudden vexation,   while a flush which Philip could easily see rose in her cheeks. 
  &quot;When I doctored your foot?&quot; he finished, rather unchivalrously,   chuckling in his delight at her pretty discomfiture. &quot;No, that   wouldn't be the third, Miss Jeanne. The other scene which I shall   never forget was that on the stone pier at Churchill, when you met  a  beautiful girl who was coming off the ship.&quot; 
  The blood leaped to Jeanne's face. Her soft lips tightened. A   sudden movement, and the bearskin slipped from her shoulders,  leaving  her leaning a little forward, her eyes blazing. A dozen  words had  transformed her from the child he had fancied her to a  woman quivering  with some powerful emotion, her beautiful head  proud and erect, her  nostrils dilating with the quickness of her  breath. 
  &quot;That was a mistake,&quot; she said. There was no sign of passion in   her voice. It trembled a little, but that was all. &quot;It was a  mistake,  M'sieur Philip. I thought that I knew her, and&#8212;and I  was wrong.  You&#8212;you must not remember THAT!&quot; 
  &quot;I am no better than a wild beast,&quot; groaned Philip, hating   himself. &quot;I'm the biggest idiot in the world when it comes to  saying  the wrong thing, I never miss a chance. I didn't mean to  say  anything&#8212;that would hurt&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You haven't,&quot; interrupted the girl, quickly, seeing the distress   in his face. &quot;You haven't said a thing that's wrong. Only I don't   want you to remember THAT picture. I want you to think of me as&#8212;   as&#8212;I burned the bad man's neck.&quot; 
  She was laughing now, though her breast was rising and falling a   little excitedly and the deep color was still in her cheeks. 
  &quot;Will you?&quot; she entreated. 
  &quot;Until I die,&quot; he exclaimed. 
  She was fumbling under the luggage, and dragged forth a second   paddle. 
  &quot;I've had an easy time with you, M'sieur Philip,&quot; she said,   turning so that she was kneeling with her back to him. &quot;Pierre  makes  me work. Always I kneel here, in the bow, and paddle. I am  ashamed of  myself. You have worked all night.&quot; 
  &quot;And I feel as fresh as though I had slept for a week,&quot; declared   Philip, his eyes devouring the slim figure a paddle's length in  front  of him. 
  For an hour they continued up the river, with scarcely a word   between them to break the silence. Their paddles rose and fell  with a  rhythmic motion; the water rippled like low music under  their canoe;  the spell of the silent shores, of voiceless beauty,  of the wilderness  awakening into day appealed to them both and  held them quiet. The sun  broke faintly through the drawn mists  behind. Its first rays lighted  up Jeanne's rumpled hair, so that  her heavy braid, partly undone and  falling upon the luggage behind  her, shone in rich and changing colors  that fascinated Philip. He  had thought that Jeanne's hair was very  dark, but he saw now that  it was filled with the rare life of a Titian  head, running from  red to gold and dark brown, with changing shadows  and flashes of  light. It was beautiful. And Jeanne, as he looked at  her, he  thought to be the most beautiful thing on earth. The movement  of  her arms, the graceful, sinuous twists of her slender body as she   put her strength upon the paddle, the poise of her head, the  piquant  tilt to her chin whenever she turned so that he caught a  half profile  of her flushed, eager face all filled his cup of  admiration to  overflowing. And he found himself wondering,  suddenly, how this girl  could be a sister to Pierre Couchee. He  saw in her no sign of French  or half-breed blood. Her hair was  fine and soft, and waved about her  ears and where it fell loose  upon the back. The color in her cheeks  was as delicate as the  tints of the bakneesh flower. She had rolled up  her broad cuffs to  give her greater freedom in paddling, and her arms  shone white and  firm, glistening with the wet drip of the paddle. He  was marveling  at her relationship to Pierre when she looked back at  him, her  face aglow with exercise and the spice of the morning, and he  saw  the sunlight as blue as the sky above him in her eyes. If he had   not known, he would have sworn that there was not a drop of  Pierre's  blood in her veins. 
  &quot;We are coming to the first rapids, M'sieur Philip,&quot; she   announced. &quot;It is just beyond that ugly mountain of rock ahead of  us,  and we will have a quarter-mile portage. It is filled with  great  stones and so swift that Pierre and I nearly wrecked  ourselves coming  down.&quot; 
  It was the most that had been said since the beginning of that   wonderful hour that had come before the first gleam of sunrise,  and  Philip, laying his paddle athwart the canoe, stretched himself  and  yawned, as though he had just awakened. 
  &quot;Poor boy,&quot; said Jeanne; and it struck him that her words were   strangely like those which Eileen might have spoken had she been   there, only an artless comradeship replaced what would have been  Miss  Brokaw's tone of intimacy. She added, with genuine sympathy  in her  face and voice: &quot;You must be exhausted, M'sieur Philip. If  you were  Pierre I should insist upon going ashore for a number of  hours. Pierre  obeys me when we are together. He calls me his  captain. Won't you let  me command you?&quot; 
  &quot;If you will let me call you&#8212;my captain,&quot; replied Philip. &quot;Only   there is one thing&#8212;one reservation. We must go on. Command me in   everything else, but we must go on&#8212;for a time. To-night I will   sleep. I will sleep like the dead. So, My Captain,&quot; he laughed,  &quot;may  I have your permission to work to-day?&quot; 
  Jeanne was turning the bow shoreward. Her back was turned to him   again. 
  &quot;You have no pity on me,&quot; she pouted. &quot;Pierre would be good to me,   and we would fish all day in that pretty pool over there. I'll bet   it's full of trout.&quot; 
  Her words, her manner of speaking them, was a new revelation to   Philip. She was delightful. He laughed, and his voice rang out in  the  clear morning like a school-boy's. Jeanne pretended that she  saw  nothing to laugh at, and no sooner had the canoe touched shore  than  she sprang lightly out, not waiting for his assistance. With  a  laughing cry, she stumbled and fell. Philip was at her side in  an  instant. 
  &quot;You shouldn't have done that,&quot; he objected. &quot;I am your doctor,   and I insist that your foot is not well.&quot; 
  &quot;But it is!&quot; cried Jeanne, and he saw that there was laughter   instead of pain in her eyes. &quot;It's the bandage. My right foot  feels  like that of a Chinese debutante. Ugh! I'm going to undo  it.&quot; 
  &quot;You've been to China, too,&quot; mused Philip, half to himself. 
  &quot;I know that it's filled with yellow girls, and that they squeeze   their feet like this,&quot; said Jeanne, unlacing her moccasin. &quot;My  tutor  and I have just finished a delightful trip along the Great  Wall. We'd  go to Peking, in an automobile, if I wasn't afraid.&quot; 
  Philip's groan was audible. He went to the canoe, and Jeanne's red   lips curled in a merriment which it was hard for her too suppress.   Philip did not see. When he had unloaded the canoe and turned,  Jeanne  was walking slowly back and forth, limping a little. 
  &quot;It's all right,&quot; she said, answering the question on his lips. &quot;I   don't feel any pain at all, but my foot's asleep. Won't you please   unstrap the small pack? I'm going to make my toilet while you are   gone with the canoe.&quot; 
  Half an hour later Philip unshouldered the canoe at the upper end   of the rapids. His own toilet articles were back in the cabin with   Gregson, but he took a wash in the river and combed his hair with  his  fingers. When he returned, there was a transformation in  Jeanne. Her  beautiful hair was done up in shining coils. She had  changed her  bedraggled skirt for another of soft, yellow buckskin.  At her throat  she wore a fluffy mass of crimson stuff which seemed  to reflect a  richer rose-flush in her cheeks. A curious thought  came to Philip as  he looked at her. Like a flash the memory of a  certain night came to  him&#8212;when it had taken Miss Brokaw and her  maid two hours to make a  toilet for a ball. And Jeanne, in the  heart of a wilderness, had made  herself more beautiful than  Eileen. He imagined, as she stood before  him, a little embarrassed  by the admiration in his eyes, the sensation  Jeanne would create  in a ballroom at home. And then he  laughed&#8212;laughed joyously at  thoughts which he could not reveal to  Jeanne, and which she, by  some quick intuition, knew that she should  not ask him to express. 
  Twice again Philip made the portage, accompanied the second time   by Jeanne, who insisted on carrying a small pack and two paddles.  In  spite of his determination and splendid physique, Philip began  to feel  the effects of the tremendous strain which he had been  under for so  long. He counted back and found that he had slept but  six hours in the  last forty-eight. There was a warning ache in his  shoulders and a  gnawing pain in the bones of his forearms. But he  knew that he had not  yet made sufficient headway up the Churchill.  It would not be  difficult for him to make a camp far enough back  in the bush to avoid  discovery; but, at the same time, if he and  Jeanne were pursued, the  stop would give their enemies a chance to  get ahead of them. This  danger he wished to escape. 
  He flattered himself that Jeanne saw no signs of his weakening. He   did not know that Jeanne put more and more effort into her paddle,   until her arms and body ached, because she saw the truth. 
  The Churchill narrowed and its current became swifter as they   progressed. Five portages were made between sunrise and eleven   o'clock. They ate dinner at the fifth, and rested for two hours.  Then  the journey was resumed. It was three o'clock when Jeanne  dropped her  paddle and turned to Philip. There were deep lines in  his face. He  smiled, but there was more of haggard misery than  cheer in the smile.  There was an unnatural flush in his cheeks,  and he began to feel a  burning pain where the blow had fallen upon  his head before. For a  full half-minute Jeanne looked at him  without speaking. &quot;Philip,&quot; she  said&#8212;and it was the first time  she had spoken his name in this way,  &quot;I insist upon going ashore  immediately. If you do not land&#8212;now&#8212;in  that opening ahead, I  shall jump out, and you can go on alone.&quot; 
  &quot;As you say&#8212;my Captain Jeanne,&quot; surrendered Philip, a little   dizzily. 
  Jeanne guided the canoe to the shore, and was the first to spring   out, while Philip steadied the light craft with his paddle. She   pointed to the luggage. 
  &quot;We will want the tent&#8212;everything,&quot; she said, &quot;because we are   going to camp here until to-morrow.&quot; 
  Once on shore, Philip's dizziness left him. He pulled the canoe   high up on the bank, and then Jeanne and he set off, side by side,  to  explore the high, wooded ground back from the river. They  followed a  well-worn moose trail, and two or three hundred yards  from the stream  came upon a small opening cluttered by great rocks  and surrounded by  clumps of birch, spruce, and banskian pine. The  moose trail crossed  this rough open space; and, following it to  the opposite side, Philip  and Jeanne came upon a clear, rippling  little stream, scarcely two  yards in width, hidden in places under  thick caribou moss and jungles  of seedling pines. It was an ideal  camping spot, and Jeanne gave a  little cry of delight when they  found the cold water of the creek. 
  Philip then returned to the river, concealed the canoe, covered up   all traces of their landing, and began to carry the camping outfit   back to the open. The small silk tent for Jeanne's use he set up  in a  little grassy corner of the clearing, and built their fire a  dozen  paces from it. With a sort of thrilling pleasure he began  cutting  balsam boughs for Jeanne's bed. He cut armful after  armful, and it was  growing dusk in the forest by the time he was  done. In the glow and  the heat of the fire Jeanne's cheeks were as  pink as an apple. She had  turned a big flat rock into a table, and  as she busied herself about  this she burst suddenly into a soft  ripple of song; then, remembering  that it was not Pierre who was  near her, she stopped. Philip, with his  last armful of bedding,  was directly behind her, and he laughed  happily at her over the  green mass of balsam when she turned and saw  him looking at her. 
  &quot;You like this?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;It is glorious!&quot; cried Jeanne, her eyes flashing. She seemed to   grow taller before him, and stood with her head thrown back, lips   parted, gazing upon the wilderness about her. &quot;It is glorious!&quot;  she  repeated, breathing deeply. &quot;There is nothing in the whole  world that  could make me give this up, M'sieur Philip. I was born  in it. I want  to die in it. Only&#8212;&quot; 
  Her face clouded for a moment as her eyes rested upon his. 
  &quot;Your civilization is coming north to spoil it all,&quot; she added,   and turned to the rock table. 
  Philip dropped his load. 
  &quot;Supper is ready,&quot; she said, and the cloud had passed. 
  It was Jeanne's first reference to his own people, to the invasion   of civilization into the north, and there recurred to Philip the   words in which she had cried out her hatred against Churchill. But   Jeanne did not betray herself again. She was quiet while they were   eating, and Philip saw that she was very tired. When they had   finished, they sat for a few minutes watching the lowering flames  of  the fire. Darkness had gathered about them. Their faces and the  rock  were illumined more and more faintly as the embers died down.  A  silence fell upon them. In the banskians close behind them an  owl  hooted softly, a cautious, drumming note, as though the night-  bird  possessed still a fear of the newly dead day. The brush gave  out  sound&#8212;voices infinitesimally small, strange quiverings,  rustlings  that might have been made by wind, by breath, by  shadows, almost.  Overhead the tips of the spruce and tall pines  whispered among  themselves, as they never commune by day. Spirits  seemed to move among  them, sending down to Jeanne's and Philip's  listening ears a restful,  sleepy murmur. Farther back there  sounded a deep sniff, where a moose,  traveling the well-worn  trail, stopped in sudden fear and wonder at  the strange man-scent  which came to its nostrils. And still farther,  from some little  lake nameless and undiscovered in the black depths of  the forest  to the south, a great northern loon sent out its cowardly  cry of  defiance to all night things, and then plunged deep under  water,  as though frightened into the depths by its own mad jargon. The   fire died lower. Philip moved a little nearer to the girl, whose   breathing he could hear. 
  &quot;Jeanne,&quot; he said, softly, fighting to keep himself from touching   her hand, &quot;I know what you mean&#8212;I understand. Two years ago I  gave  up civilization for this. I am glad that I wrote to you as I  did, for  now you will believe me and know that I understand. I  love this world  up here as you love it. I am never going back  again.&quot; 
  Jeanne was silent. 
  &quot;But there is one thing, at least one&#8212;which I cannot understand   in you,&quot; he went on, nerving himself for what might come a moment   later. &quot;You are of this world&#8212;you hate civilization&#8212;and yet you   have brought a man into the north to teach you its ways. I mean  this  man who you say is the most wonderful man in the world.&quot; 
  He waited, trembling. It seemed an eternity before Jeanne   answered. And then she said: 
  &quot;He is my father, M'sieur Philip.&quot; 
  Philip could not speak. Darkness hid him from Jeanne. She did not   see that which leaped into his face, and that for a moment he was  on  the point of flinging himself at her feet. 
  &quot;You spoke of yourself, of Pierre, of your father, and of one   other at Fort o' God,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I thought that he&#8212;the other   &#8212;was your tutor.&quot; 
  &quot;No, it is Pierre's sister,&quot; replied Jeanne. 
  &quot;Your sister! You have a sister?&quot; 
  He could hear Jeanne catch her breath. 
  &quot;Listen, M'sieur,'&quot; she said, after a moment. &quot;I must tell you a   little about Pierre, a story of something that happened a long,  long  time ago. It was in the middle of a terrible winter, and  Pierre was  then a boy. One day he was out hunting and he came upon  a trail&#8212;the  trail of a woman who had dragged herself through the  snow in her  moccasined feet. It was far out upon a barren, where  there was no  life, and he followed. He found her, M'sieur, and she  was dead. She  had died from cold and starvation. An hour sooner he  might have saved  her, for, wrapped up close against her breast, he  found a little  child&#8212;a baby girl, and she was alive. He brought  her to Fort o' God,  M'sieur&#8212;to a noble man who lived there almost  alone; and there,  through all these years, she has lived and grown  up. And no one knows  who her mother was, or who her father was,  and so it happens that  Pierre, who found her, is her brother, and  the man who has loved her  and cared for her is her father.&quot; 
  &quot;And she is the other at Fort o' God&#8212;Pierre's sister,&quot; said   Philip. 
  Jeanne rose from the rock and moved toward the tent, glimmering   indistinctly in the night. Her voice came back chokingly. 
  &quot;No, M'sieur. Pierre's real sister is at Fort o' God. I am the one   whom he found out on the barren.&quot; 
  To the night sounds there was added a heart-broken sob, and Jeanne   disappeared in the tent.
