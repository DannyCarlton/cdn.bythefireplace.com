They sailed over to Nevis, accompanied by a dozen slaves, and took  possession of Rachael's house in Main Street. It stood at the very end  of the town, beyond the point where the street ceased and the road round  the Island began. The high wall of the garden surrounded a grove of  palms and cocoanut trees. Only sojourners from England had occupied the  big comfortable house, and it was in good repair.    
When the acute stage of her grief had passed, it was idle for Rachael to  deny to Hamilton that she was happy. And at that time she had not a care  in the world, nor had he. Their combined incomes made them as careless  of money as any planter on the Island. Every ship from England brought  them books and music, and Hamilton was not only the impassioned lover  but the tenderest and most patient of husbands. Coaches dashed by and  the occupants cast up eyes and hands. The gay life of Nevis pulsed  unheeded about the high walls, whose gates were always locked. The  kinsman of the leading families of the Island and the most beautiful  daughter of old John and Mary Fawcett were a constant and agitating  theme, but two people lived their life of secluded and poignant  happiness, and took Nevis or St. Kitts into little account.
