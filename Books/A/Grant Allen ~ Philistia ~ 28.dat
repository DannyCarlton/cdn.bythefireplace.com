As they sat silent in that little sitting-room after supper, a double  knock at the door suddenly announced the arrival of a telegram  for Ernest. He opened it with trembling lingers. It was from  Lancaster:--'Come down to the office at once. Schurz has been  sentenced to a year's imprisonment, and we want a leader about  him for to-morrow.' The telegram roused Ernest at once from his  stupefied lethargy. Here was a chance at last of doing something  for Max Schurz and for the cause of freedom! Here was a chance  of waking up all England to a sense of the horrible crime it had  just committed through the voice of its duly accredited judicial  mouthpiece! The country was trembling on the brink of an abyss, and  he, Ernest Le Breton, might just be in time to save it. The Home  Secretary must be compelled by the unanimous clamour of thirty  millions of free working people to redress the gross injustice of  the law in sending Max Sohurz, the greatest, noblest, and purest-minded  of mankind, to a common felon's prison! Nothing else on earth could  have moved Ernest, jaded and dispirited as he was at that moment,  to the painful exertion of writing a newspaper leader after the  day's fatigues and excitements, except the thought that by doing so  he might not only blot out this national disgrace, as he considered  it, but might also help to release the martyr of the people's rights  from his incredible, unspeakable punishment. Flushed and feverish  though he was, he rose straight up from the table, handed the  telegram to Edie without a word, and started off alone to hail a  hansom cab and drive down immediately to the office. Arthur Berkeley,  fearful of what might happen to him in his present excited state,  stole out after him quietly, and followed him unperceived in another  hansom at a little distance.    
When Ernest got to the 'Morning Intelligence' buildings, he was  shown up at once into the editorial room. He expected to find Mr.  Lancaster at the same white heat of indignation as himself; but  to his immense surprise he actually found him in the usual sleepy  languid condition of apathetic impartiality. 'I wired for you, Le  Breton,' the impassive editor said calmly, 'because I understand  you know all about this man Schurz, who has just got his twelve  months' imprisonment this evening. I suppose, of course, you've  heard already all about it.'    
'I've been at the trial all day,' Ernest answered, 'and myself  heard the verdict and sentence.'    
'Good,' Mr. Lancaster said, with a dreamy touch of approval in his  tone. 'That's good journalism, certainly, and very smart of you.  Helps you to give local colour and realistic touches to the matter.  But you ought to have called in here to see me immediately. We  shall have a regular reporter's report of the trial, of course;  but reporters' reports are fearfully and wonderfully lifeless. If  you like, besides the leader, you might work up a striking headed  article on the Scene in Court. This is an important case, and we  want something more about it than mere writing, you know; a little  about the man himself and his personal history, which Berkeley tells  me you're well acquainted with. He's written something called "Gold  and the Proletariate," or whatever it is; just tell our readers  all about it. As to the leader, say what you like in it--of course  I shall look over the proof, and tone it down a bit to suit the  taste of our public--we appeal mainly to the mercantile middle class,  I need hardly say; but you know the general policy of the paper,  and you can just write what you think best, subject to subsequent  editorial revision. Get to work at once, please, as the articles  are wanted immediately, and send down slips as fast as they're  written to the printers.'    
Ernest could hardly contain his surprise at Mr. Lancaster's calmness  under such unheard-of circumstances, when the whole laborious  fabric of British liberties was tottering visibly to its base--but  he wisely concluded to himself that the editor had to see articles  written about every possible subject every evening--from a European  convulsion to a fire at a theatre,--and that use must have made  it in him a property of easiness. When a man's obliged to work  himself up perpetually into a state of artificial excitement about  every railway accident, explosion, shipwreck, earthquake, or volcanic  eruption, in Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and the islands of the  Pacific Ocean, why then, Ernest charitably said to himself, his  sympathies must naturally end by getting a trifle callous, especially  when he's such a very apathetic person to start with as this laconic  editorial Lancaster. So he turned into the little bare box devoted  to his temporary use, and began writing with perfectly unexampled  and extraordinary rapidity at his leader and his article about the  injured and martyred apostle of the slighted communistic religion.    
It was only a few months since Ernest had, with vast toil and  forethought, spun slowly out his maiden newspaper article on the  Italian organ-boy, and now he found himself, to his own immense  surprise, covering sheet after sheet of paper in feverish haste  with a long account of Max Schurz's splendid life and labours, and  with a really fervid and eloquent appeal to the English people not  to suffer such a man as he to go helplessly and hopelessly to an  English prison, at the bare bidding of a foreign despot. He never  stopped for one moment to take thought, or to correct what he had  written; in the excitement of the moment his pen travelled along  over the paper as if inspired, and he found the words and thoughts  thronging his brain almost faster than his lagging hand could  suffice to give them visible embodiment. As each page was thrown  off hurriedly, he sent it down, still pale and wet, to the printers  in the office; and before two o'clock in the morning, he had full  proofs of all he had written sent up to him for final correction. It  was a stirring and vigorous leader, he felt quite certain himself  as he read it over; and he thought with a swelling breast that  it would appear next day, with all the impersonal authority of  the 'Morning Intelligence' stamped upon its face, at ten thousand  English breakfast tables, where it might rouse the people in their  millions to protest sternly before it was too late against this  horrid violation of our cherished and boasted national hospitality.    
Meanwhile, Arthur Berkeley had stopped at the office, and run in  hastily for five minutes' talk with the terrible editor. 'Don't  say anything to shock Le Breton, I beg of you, Lancaster,' he said,  'about this poor man Schurz who has just been sent for a year to  prison. It's a very hard case, and I'm awfully sorry for the man  myself, though that's neither here nor there. I can see from your  face that you, for your part, don't sympathise with him; but at  any rate, don't say anything about it to hurt Le Breton's feelings.  He's in a dreadfully feverish and excited condition this evening;  Max Schurz has always been to him almost like a father, and he  naturally takes his sentence very bitterly to heart. To tell you  the truth, I regret it a great deal myself, I know a little of  Schurz, through Le Breton, and I know what a well-meaning, ardent,  enthusiastic person he really is, and how much good actually  underlies all his chaotic socialistic notions. But at any rate, I  do beg of you, don't say anything to further excite and hurt poor  Le Breton.'    
'Certainly not,' the editor answered, smoothing his large hands  softly one over the other. 'Certainly not; though I confess, as a  practical man, I don't sympathise in the least with this preposterous  German refugee fellow. So far as I can learn, he's been at the  bottom of half the revolutionary and insurrectionary movements of  the last twenty years--a regular out-and-out professional socialistic  incendiary.'    
'You wouldn't say so,' Berkeley replied quietly, 'if you'd seen  more of him, Lancaster.' But being a man of the world, and having  come mainly on Ernest's account, he didn't care to press the abstract  question of Herr Max's political sincerity any further.    
'Well,' the editor went on, a little testily, 'be that as it may, I  won't discuss the subject with your friend Le Breton, who's really  a nice, enthusiastic young fellow, I think, as far as I've seen  him. I'll simply let him write to-night whatever he pleases, and  make the necessary alterations in proof afterwards, without talking  it over with him personally at all. That'll avoid any needless  discussion and ruffling of his supersensitive communistic feelings.  Poor fellow, he looks very ill indeed to-night. I'm really extremely  sorry for him.'    
'When will he be finished?' asked Arthur.    
'At two,' the editor answered.    
'I'll send a cab for him,' Arthur said; 'there'll be none about  at that hour, probably. Will you kindly tell him it's waiting for  him?'    
At two o'clock or a little after, Ernest drove home with his heart  on fire, full of eagerness and swelling hope for to-morrow morning.  He found Edie waiting for him, late as it was, with a little bottle  of wine--an unknown luxury at Mrs. Halliss's lodgings--and such  light supper as she thought he could manage to swallow in his  excitement. Ernest drank a glass of the wine, but left the supper  untasted. Then he went to bed, and tossed about uneasily till  morning. He couldn't sleep through his anxiety to see his great  leader appear in all the added dignity of printer's ink and rouse  the slumbering world of England up to a due sense of Max Schurz's  wrongs and the law's incomprehensible iniquity.    
Before seven, he rose very quietly, dressed himself without  saying a word, and stole out to buy an early copy of the 'Morning  Intelligence.' He got one at the small tobacconist's shop round the  corner, where he had taken his first hint for the Italian organ-boy  leader. It was with difficulty that he could contain himself till  he was back in Mrs. Halliss's little front parlour; and there  he tore open the paper eagerly, and turned to the well-remembered  words at the beginning of his desperate appealing article. He could  recollect the very run of every clause and word he had written: 'No  Englishman can read without a thrill of righteous indignation,' it  began,'the sentence passed last night upon Max Schurz, the author  of that remarkable economical work, "Gold and the Proletariate."  Herr Schurz is one of those numerous refugees from German despotism  who have taken advantage of the hospitable welcome usually afforded  by England to the oppressed of all creeds or nations'--and so forth,  and so forth. Where was it now? Yes, that was it, in the place of  honour, of course--the first leader under the clock in the 'Morning  Intelligence.' His eye caught at once the opening key-words, 'No  Englishman.' Sinking down into the easy-chair by the flowers in the  window he prepared to run it through at his leisure with breathless  anxiety.    
'No Englishman can read without a feeling of the highest approval  the sentence passed last night upon Max Schurz, the author of that  misguided economical work, "Gold and the Proletariate." Herr Schurz  is one of those numerous refugees from German authority, who have  taken advantage of the hospitable welcome usually afforded by England  to the oppressed of all creeds or nations, in order to hatch plots  in security against the peace of sovereigns or governments with  which we desire always to maintain the most amicable and cordial  relations.' Ernest's eyes seemed to fail him. The type on the paper  swam wildly before his bewildered vision. What on earth could  this mean? It was his own leader, indeed, with the very rhythm and  cadence of the sentences accurately preserved, but with all the  adjectives and epithets so ingeniously altered that it was turned  into a crushing condemnation of Max Schurz, his principles,  his conduct, and his ethical theories. From beginning to end, the  article appealed to the common-sense of intelligent Englishmen to  admire the dignity of the law in thus vindicating itself against  the atrocious schemes of a dangerous and ungrateful political exile  who had abused the hospitality of a great fres country to concoct  vile plots against the persons of friendly sovereigns and innocent  ministers on the European continent.    
Ernest laid down the paper dreamily, and leant back for a moment  in his chair, to let his brain recover a little from the reeling  dizziness of that crushing disappointment. Then he turned in a  giddy mechanical fashion to the headed article on the fourth page.  There the self-same style of treatment met once more his astonished  gaze. All the minute facts as to Max Schurz's history and personality  were carefully preserved; the description of his simple artisan  life, his modest household, his Sunday evening receptions, his great  following of earnest and enthusiastic refugees--every word of all  this, which hardly anyone else could have equally well supplied,  was retained intact in the published copy; yet the whole spirit  of the thing had utterly evaporated, or rather had been perverted  into the exact opposite unsympathetic channel. Where Ernest had  written 'enthusiasm,' Lancaster had simply altered the word to  'fanaticism;' where Ernest had spoken of Herr Max's 'single-hearted  devotion,' Lancaster had merely changed the phrase into 'undisguised  revolutionary ardour.' The whole paper was one long sermon against  Max Schurz's Utopian schemes, imputing to him not only folly but  even positive criminality as well. We all know how we all in England  look upon the foreign political refugee--a man to be hit again with  impunity, because he has no friends; but to Ernest, who had lived  so long in his own little socialistic set, the discovery that people  could openly say such things against his chosen apostle at the very  moment of his martyrdom, was a hideous and blinding disillusionment.  He put the paper down upon the table once more, and buried his face  helplessly between his burning hands.    
The worst of it all was this: if Herr Max ever saw those articles  he would naturally conclude that Ernest had been guilty of the  basest treachery, and that too on the very day when he most needed  the aid and sympathy of all his followers. With a thrill of horror  he thought in his own soul that the great leader might suspect him  for an hour of being the venal Judas of the little sect.    
How Ernest ever got through that weary day he did not know himself;  nothing kept him up through it except his burning indignation  against Lancaster's abominable conduct. About eleven o'clock,  Arthur Berkeley called in to see him. 'I'm afraid you've been a  little disappointed,' he said, 'about the turn Lancaster has given  to your two articles. He told me he meant to alter the tone so  as to suit the policy of the paper, and I see he's done so very  thoroughly. You can't look for much sympathy from commonplace,  cold, calculating Englishmen for enthusiastic natures like Herr  Max's.'    
Ernest turned to him in blank amazement. He had expected Berkeley  to be as angry as himself at Lancaster's shameful mutilation of his  appealing leader; and he found now that even Berkeley accepted it  as an ordinary incident in the course of journalistic business. His  heart sank within him as he thought how little hope there could be  of Herr Max's liberation, when even his own familiar friend Berkeley  looked upon the matter in such a casual careless fashion.    
'I shall never write another word for the "Morning Intelligence,"'  he cried vehemently, after a moment's pause. 'If we starve for  it, I shall never write another word in that wicked, abominable,  dishonourable paper. I can die easily enough, heaven knows, without  a murmur: but I can't be disloyal to dear Herr Max, and to all my  innate ingrained principles.'    
'Don't say that, Ernest,' Berkeley answered gently. 'Think of  Mrs. Le Breton and the baby. The luxury of starvation for the sake  of a cause is one you might venture to allow yourself if you were  alone in the world as I am, but not one which you ought to force  unwillingly upon your wife and children. You've been getting a  trifle more practical of late under the spur of necessity; don't go  and turn impossible again at the supreme moment. Whatever happens,  it's your plain duty to go on writing for the "Morning Intelligence."  You say with your own hand only what you think and believe yourself:  the editor alone is responsible for the final policy of the paper.'    
Ernest only muttered slowly to himself,--'Never, never, never!'    
Still, though the first attempt had failed, Ernest did not wholly  give up his hopes of doing something towards the release of Herr Max  from that unutterable imprisonment. He drew up a form of petition  to the Home Secretary, in which he pointed out the reasons for  setting aside the course of the law in the case of this particular  political prisoner. With feverish anxiety he ran about London  for the next two days, trying to get influential signatures to his  petition, and to rouse the people in their millions to demand the  release of the popular martyr. Alas for the stolid indifference of  the British public! The people in their millions sat down to eat  and drink, and rose up to play, exactly as if nothing unusual in  any way had happened. Most of them had never heard at all of Herr  Max, or of 'Gold and the Proletariate,' and those who had heard  understood for the most part that he was a bad lot who was imprisoned  for trying nefariously to blow up the Emperor of Rooshia. Crowds  of people nightly besieged the doors of the Ambiguities and the  Marlborough, to hear the fate of 'The Primate of Fiji' and 'The Duke  of Bermondsey;' but very few among the millions took the trouble to  sign their names to Ernest Le Breton's despairing petition. Even  the advanced radicals of the market-place, the men who figured  largely at Trafalgar Square meetings and Agricultural Labourers'  Unions, feared to damage their reputation for moderation and sobriety  by getting themselves mixed up with a continental agitator like  this man Schurz that people were talking about. The Irish members  expressed a pious horror of the very word dynamite: the working-man  leaders hemmed and hawed, and regretted their inability, in their  very delicate position, to do anything which might seem like  countenancing Russian nihilism. In the end, Ernest sent, in his  petition with only half a dozen unknown signatures; and the Home  Secretary's private prompter threw it into the waste-paper basket  entire, without even taking the trouble to mention its existence  to his harassed and overburdened chief. Just a Marylebone communist  refugee in prison! How could a statesman with half the bores and  faddists of England on his troubled hands, find time to look at  uninfluential petitions about an insignificant worthless nobody  like that?    
So gentle, noble-natured, learned Herr Max went to prison and served  his year there uncomplainingly, like any other social malefactor;  and Society talked about his case with languid interest for nearly  a fortnight, and then straightway found a new sensation, and forgot  all about him. But there are three hundred and sixty-five days of  twenty-four hours each in every year; and for every one of those days  Herr Max and Herr Max's friends never forgot for an hour together  that he was in prison.    
And at the end of the week Ernest got a letter from Lancaster,  enclosing a cheque for eight guineas. That is a vast sum of money,  eight guineas: just think of all the bread, and meat, and tea,  and clothing one can buy with it for a small family! 'My dear Le  Breton,' the editor wrote--in his own hand, too; a rare honour;  for he was a kindly man, and he had learned, much to his surprise,  from Arthur Berkeley, that Ernest was angry at his treatment of the  Schurzian leader: 'My dear Le Breton, I enclose cheque for eight  guineas, for your two articles. I hope you didn't mind the way  I was obliged to cut them up in some unessential details, so as  to suit the policy of the paper. I kept whatever was really most  distinctive as embodying special information in them. You know  we are above all things strictly moderate. Please send us another  social shortly.'    
It was a kind letter, undoubtedly a kind and kindly-meant letter:  but Ernest flung it from him as though he had been stung by a  serpent or a scorpion. Then he handed the cheque to Edie in solemn  silence, to see what she would do with it. He merely wanted to try  her constancy. For himself, he would have felt like a Judas indeed  if he had taken and used their thirty pieces of silver.    
Edie looked at the cheque intently and sighed a deep sigh of regret.  How could she do otherwise? They were so very poor, and it was  such an immense sum of money! Then she rose quietly without saying  a word, and lighted a match from the box on the mantelpiece. She  held the cheque firmly between her finger and thumb till it was  nearly burnt, end let it drop slowly at last into the empty fireplace.  Ernest rose up and kissed her tenderly. The leaden weight of the  thirty pieces of silver was fairly off their united conscience. They  had made what reparation they could for the evil of that unhappy,  undesigned leader. After all Ernest had wasted the last remnant of  his energy on one eventful evening, all for nothing.    
As Edie sat looking wistfully at the smouldering fragments of the  burnt cheque, Ernest roused her again by saying quietly, 'To-day's  Saturday. Have we got anything for to-morrow's dinner, Edie?'    
'Nothing,' Edie answered, simply. 'How much money have you left,  Ernest?'    
'Sixpence,' Ernest said, without needing to consult his empty  purse for confirmation--he had counted the pence, as they went, too  carefully for that already. 'Edie, I'm afraid we must go at last  to the poor man's banker till I can get some more money.'    
'Oh, Ernest--not--not--not the pawnbroker!'    
'Yes, Edie, the pawnbroker.'    
The tears came quickly into Edie's eyes, but she answered nothing.  They must have food, and there was no other way open before them.  They rose together and went quietly into the bedroom. There they  gathered together the few little trinkets and other things that might  be of use to them, and Ernest took down his hat from the stand to  go out with them to the pawnbroker's.    
As he turned out he was met energetically on the landing by a  stout barricade from good Mrs. Halliss. 'No, sir, not you, sir,'  the landlady said firmly, trying to take the parcel from him as he  went towards the door. 'I beg your pardon, sir, for 'avin' over'eard  what wasn't meant for me to 'ear, no doubt, but I couldn't 'elp it,  sir, and John an' me can't allow nothink of this sort, we can't.  We're used to this sort o' things, sir, John and me is; but you  and the dear lady isn't used to 'em, sir, and didn't nought to be  neither, and John an' me can't allow it, not anyhow.'    
Ernest turned scarlet with shame, but could say nothing. Edie only  whispered softly, 'Dear, dear Mrs. Halliss, we're so sorry, but we  can't help it.'    
''Elp it, ma'am,' said Mrs. Halliss, herself almost crying, 'nor  there ain't no reason why you should try to 'elp it neither. As I  says to John, "John," says I, "there ain't no 'arm in it, noways,"  says I, "but I can't stand by," says I, "and see them two poor dear  young creechurs," meanin' no offence, ma'am, "a-pawning of their  own jewelry and things to go and pay for their Sunday's dinner."  And John, 'e says, says 'e, "Quite right, Martha," says 'e; "don't  let 'em, my dear," says 'e. "The Lord has prospered us a bit in our  'umble way, Martha," says 'e, "and we ain't got no cause to want,  we ain't; and if the dear lady and the good gentleman wouldn't  take it as a liberty," says 'e, "it 'ud be better they should just  borrer a pound or two for a week from us," says 'e, beggin' your  pardon, ma'am, for 'intin' of it, "than that there Mr. Le Breting,  as ain't accustomed to such places nohow, should go a-makin'  acquaintance, for the fust time of his life, as you may say, with  the inside of a pawnbroker's shop," says 'e. "John," says I, "it's  my belief the lady and gentleman 'ud be insulted," says I, "though  they <i>are</i> the sweetest unassoomin'est young gentlefolk I ever did  see," says I, "if we were to go as tin' them to accept the loan  of money from the likes of you and me, John, as is no better, by  the side of them, nor old servants, in the manner o' speakin'."  "Insulted," says 'e; "not a bit of it, they needn't, Martha,"  says 'e, "for I knows the ways of the aristocracy," says 'e, "and  I knows as there's many a gentleman as owns 'is own 'osses and  'is own 'ounds as isn't afraid to borrer a pound or so from 'is own  coachman, or even from 'is own groom--not but what to borrer from  a groom is lowerin'," says 'e, "in a tempory emergency. Mind you,  Martha," says 'e, "a tempory emergency is a thing as may 'appen  to landed gentlefolks any day," says 'e. "It's like a 'ole in your  coat made by a tear," says 'e; "a haccident as may 'appen to-morrer  to the Prince of Wales 'isself upon the 'untin' field," 'e says.  "Well, then, John," says I, "I'll just go an' speak to 'em about  it, this very minnit," says I, and if I might make so bold, ma'am,  without seemin' too presumptious, I should be very glad if you'd  kindly allow me, ma'am, to lend Mr. Le Breting a few suvverins till  'e gets 'is next remittances, ma'am.'    
Edie looked at Ernest, and Ernest looked at Edie and the landlady;  and then they all three burst out crying together without further  apology. Perhaps it was the old Adam left in Ernest a little;  but though he could stand kindness from Dr. Greatrex or from Mr.  Lancaster stoically enough, he couldn't watch the humble devotion  of those two honest-hearted simple old servants without a mingled  thrill of shame and tenderness. 'Mrs. Halliss,' he said, catching  up the landlady's hard red hand gratefully in his own, 'you are too  good and too kind, and too considerate for us altogether. I feel  we have done nothing to deserve such great kindness from you. But  I really don't think it would be right of us to borrow from you when  we don't even know how long it may be before we're able to return  your money or whether we shall ever be able to return it at all.  We're so much obliged to you, so very very much obliged to you,  dear Mrs. Halliss, but I think we ought as a matter of duty to pawn  these few little things rather than run into debt which we've no  fair prospect at present of ever redeeming.'    
'<i>Has</i> you please, sir,' Mrs. Halliss said gently, wiping her eyes  with her snow-white apron, for she saw at once that Ernest really  meant what he said. 'Not that John an' me would think of it for a  minnit, sir, so long as you wouldn't mind our takin' the liberty;  but any'ow, sir, we can't allow you to go out yourself and go to  the pawnbroker's. It ain't no fit place for the likes of you, sir,  a pawnbroker's ain't, in all that low company; and I don't suppose  you'd rightly know 'ow much to hask on the articles, neither.  John, 'e ain't afeard of goin'; an' 'e says, 'e insists upon it as  'e's to go, for 'e don't think, sir, for the honour of the 'ouse,  'e says, sir, as a lodger of ours ought to be seen a-goin' to the  pawnbroker's. Just you give them things right over to John, sir,  and 'e'll get you a better price on 'em by a long way nor they'd  ever think of giving a gentleman like you, sir.'    
Ernest fought off the question in a half-hearted fashion for a  little while, but Mrs. Halliss insisted upon it, and after a short  time Ernest gave way, for to say the truth he had very vague ideas  himself as to how he ought to proceed in a pawnbroking expedition.  Mrs. Halliss ran down the kitchen stairs quickly, for fear he  should change his mind as soon as her back was turned, and called  out gaily to her husband in the first delight of her unexpected  triumph.    
'John,' she cried, '--drat that man, where is 'e? John, dear, you  just putt your 'at on, and purtend to run round the corner a bit  to Aston's the pawnbroker's. The Lord have mercy upon me for the  stories I've been a-tellin' of 'em, but I couldn't bear to see them  two pore things a-pawnin' their little bits of jewelry and sich,  and Mr. Le Breting, too, 'im as ain't fit to go knockin' together  with underbred folks like pawnbrokers. So I told 'im as you'd take  'em round and pawn 'em for 'im yourself; not as I don't suppose  you've never pawned nothink in your 'ole life, John, leastways not  since ever you an' me kep' company, for afore that I suppose you  was purty much like other young men is, John, for all you shakes  your 'ead at it now so innocent like. But you just run round,  there's a dear, and make as if you was goin' to the pawnbroker's,  and then you come straight 'ome again unbeknown to 'em. I ain't  a goin' to let them two pore dears go pawnin' their things for a  dinner nohow. You take them two suvverins out of your box, John,  and putt away these 'ere little things for the present time till  the pore souls is able to pay us, and if they never don't, small  matter neither. Now you go fast, John, there's a dear, and come  back, and mind you give them two suvverins to Mr. Le Breting as  natural like as ever you're able.'    
'Pawn 'em,' John said in a pitying voice, 'no indeed, it ain't  come to that yet, I should 'ope, that they need go a-pawnin' their  effects while we've got a suvverin or two laid by in our box,  Martha. Not as anybody need be ashamed of pawnin' on occasions, for  that matter,--I don't say as a reg'lar thing, but now an' then on  occasions, as you may call it; for even in the best dookal families,  I've 'eard tell they <i>do</i> sometimes 'ave to pawn the dimonds, so  that pawnin' ain't in the runnin' noways, bless you, as respects  gentility. Not as I'd like to go into a pawnshop myself, Martha,  as I've always been brought up respectable; but when you send for  Mr. Hattenborough to your own ressydence and say quite commandin'  like, "'Er Grace 'ud be obleeged if you'd wait upon 'er in Belgrave  Square to hinspeck 'er dimonds as I want to raise the wind on 'em,"  why, that's quite another matter nat'rally.'    
When honest John came back in a few minutes and handed the  two sovereigns over to Ernest, he did it with such an unblushing  face as might have won him applause on any stage for its perfect  naturalness. 'Lor' bless your 'eart, sir,' he said in answer to  Ernest's shamefaced thanks, touching the place where his hat ought  to be mechanically, 'it ain't nothing, sir, that ain't. If it  weren't for the dookal families of England, sir, it's my belief the  pawnbrokin' business wouldn't be worth mentioning in the manner o'  speakin'.'    
That evening, Ernest paced up and down the little parlour rather  moodily for half an hour with three words ringing perpetually in his  dizzy ears-the 'Never, never, never,' he had used so short a tune  since about the 'Morning Intelligence.' He must get money somehow  for Dot and Edie! he must get money somehow to pay good Mrs. Halliss  for their board and lodging! There was only one way possible.  Fight against it as he would, in the end he must come back to that  inevitable conclusion. At last he sat down with a gloomy face at  the centre table, and pulled out a sheet of blank foolscap.    
'What are you going to do, Ernest?' Edie asked him.    
Ernest groaned. 'I'm writing a social for the "Morning Intelligence,"  Edie,' he answered bitterly.    
'Oh, Ernest!' Edie said with a face of horror and surprise. 'Not  after the shameful way they've treated poor Max Schurz!'    
Ernest groaned again. 'There's nothing else to be done, Edie,' he  said, looking up at her despondently. 'I must earn money somehow  to keep the house going.'    
It is the business of the truthful historian to narrate facts, not  to palliate or extenuate the conduct of the various actors. Whether  Ernest did right or wrong, at least he did it; he wrote a playful  social for Monday's 'Morning Intelligence,' and carried it into  the office on Sunday afternoon himself, beause there was no postal  delivery in the London district.    
That night, he lay awake once more for hours together, tossing  and turning, and reflecting bitterly on his own baseness and his  final moral downfall. Herbert was right, after all. The environment  was beginning to conquer. He could hold out no longer. Herr Max  was in prison; the world was profoundly indifferent; he himself  had fallen away like Peter; and there was nothing left for him now  but to look about and find himself a dishonourable grave.    
And Dot? And Edie? What was to become of them after? Ah me, for  the pity of it when a man cannot even crawl quietly into a corner  and die in peace like a dog, without being tortured by fears  and terrors beforehand as to what will come to those he loves far  better than life when he himself is quietly dead and buried out of  the turmoil!
