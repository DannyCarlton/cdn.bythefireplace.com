  Squire Leech lived in a large, square, white house, situated on an   eminence some way back from the street. It had bay windows on either   side of the front door, a gravel walk, bordered with flowers, leading   to the gate, a small summerhouse on the lawn, and altogether was much   the handsomest residence in the village. Three years before, the   house, or, at all events, the principal rooms, had been newly   furnished from the city. No wonder the squire and all the family held   up their heads, and regarded themselves as belonging to the   aristocracy. 
  In a back room, used partly as a sitting room, partly as an office,   the great man and his new superintendent, Amos Banks, were sitting,   the evening previous to Herbert's return home. It may be asked why   Squire Leech needed a superintendent. To this I answer that his   property, beside the home farm, included two outlying farms, which he   preferred to carry on himself rather than let to tenants. Besides, he   had stocks and bonds, to which he himself attended. But the farms   required more attention than he individually was willing to bestow.   Accordingly he employed a competent man, who had the general   supervision of them. His former superintendent having emigrated to the   West, he had engaged Mr. Banks, who had been recommended to him for   the charge. Banks came from a town thirty miles distant, and had never   lived in Wrayburn before. He had just entered upon his duties, and was   talking over business matters with the squire. 
  &#8220;You will occupy the house on the Ross farm,&#8221; said Squire Leech. &#8220;I   think you will find it comfortable. I have always reserved it for my   superintendent.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There is a house on the other farm, I suppose,&#8221; said Banks. 
  &#8220;Yes; but that is occupied by a family already. I don't rent the  farm,  that is, except about half an acre of land for a kitchen garden.  That  I have prepared to cultivate myself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Precisely,&#8221; said the superintendent. &#8220;I will tell you why I  inquired.  You tell me there will be need of another permanent farm  workman. Now  I know an excellent man&#8212;in fact, he is a cousin of my  own&#8212;who would  be glad to accept the place.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very well. I have no objection to your engaging him, since you  vouch  for him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, yes; he is a faithful and industrious man, and he will be  willing  to do work for moderate wages. Indeed, he cares more for a  permanent  place than high pay. Where he is now, he is liable to be  idle for some  months in the year.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Is he a family man?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; he has two young children.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Of course he will move to Wrayburn.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; if he can get a suitable house. In fact, that was what I was   coming at. I thought of your other house, but you say that is already   occupied.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; and the family has occupied it for several years. I should  not  like to dislodge them.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you know any other small house my cousin could rent?&#8221; 
  Squire Leech reflected. 
  &#8220;The fact is,&#8221; he said, after a pause, &#8220;there has not been much   building going on in Wrayburn for several years, and it is hard to   find a vacant house.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am sorry for that. I am afraid it may interfere with Brown's   coming.&#8221; 
  &#8220;There is one house, I think, that would just suit your cousin,&#8221;  said  Squire Leech, slowly. 
  &#8220;Where is it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is now occupied by the widow Carter and her son.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Is she going to move?&#8221; 
  &#8220;She wouldn't like to.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then how will that help us? Who owns the house?&#8221; 
  &#8220;She does; that is, nominally. I hold a mortgage on the place for   seven hundred and fifty dollars, which is more than half the market   value.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then it may eventually fall into your hands?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very probably. Between ourselves, I think it probable that she  will  fail to be ready with the semi-annual interest, which comes due  next  week. She is quite poor&#8212;has nothing but this property&#8212;and has  to sew  for a living, or braid straw, neither of which pays well.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Suppose she is not ready with the interest, do you propose to   foreclose?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think I shall. I will allow her three or four hundred dollars  for  her share of the property, and that will be the best thing she can  do,  in my opinion.&#8221; 
  Whether or not it would be the best thing for Mrs. Carter, it   certainly wouldn't be a bad speculation for the squire, since the   place, as already stated, was worth fully fifteen hundred dollars. How   a rich man can deliberately plot to defraud a poor woman of a portion   of her small property, you and I, my young reader, may find it hard to   understand. Unfortunately there are too many cases in real life where   just such things happen, so that there really seems to be a good deal   of truth in the old adage that prosperity hardens the heart. 
  If Mr. Banks had been a just or kind-hearted man, he would not have   encouraged his employer in the plan he had just broached; but he was   selfish, and thought he saw in it an easy solution of the difficulty   which he had met with in securing a house for his cousin. He did not   know Mrs. Carter, and felt no particular interest in the question what   was to become of her if she was ejected from her house. No doubt she   would find a home somewhere. At any rate, it was not his business. 
  &#8220;It seems to me that will be an excellent plan,&#8221; he said, with   satisfaction. &#8220;How soon can we find out about it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Next week&#8212;Tuesday. It is then that the interest comes due.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Suppose she is ready to pay the interest, what then?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then I will make her an offer for the place, and represent to her   that it will be the better plan for her to part with it, and so escape   the payment of interest. She has to pay forty-five dollars a year, and   that is a great drain upon one who earns no more than she does.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think you said she had a son; does he earn anything? Or perhaps  he  isn't old enough.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, he is thirteen or fourteen; still, there isn't much in a  small  village like this for a boy to do. He is attending school, I  believe.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then, in one way or another, you think there is a good chance of  our  obtaining the house,&#8221; said the superintendent, with satisfaction. 
  &#8220;Yes, I think so.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How would it do to go around and speak to the widow about it   beforehand? I could then write to Brown.&#8221; 
  &#8220;As to that, she may be very particular to retain the house, and  even  if she is not provided with the money, succeed in borrowing  enough.  Now, my idea is to say nothing about it till Tuesday. She may  depend  upon my waiting a few days. That I shall not do. If the money  is not  forthcoming I will foreclose at once, without giving her time  to  arrange for the money.&#8221; 
  The superintendent nodded. 
  &#8220;A very shrewd plan, Squire Leech,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By the way, where is  the  house situated?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Only a furlong up the road. It is on the opposite side of the  way.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think I remember it. There is some land connected with it, isn't   there?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Nearly an acre. The house is small, but neat. In fact, for a small   place, I consider it quite desirable. Tomorrow we will ride by it, and   you can take more particular notice.&#8221; 
  They did ride by, as we know, and Squire Leech pointed it out to  his  superintendent. Herbert noticed this, but he did not know that the  two  men had formed a scheme for turning his mother and himself out of   their comfortable home, and defrauding his mother of a considerable   portion of the small property which his father had left. Had he known   this, it would have filled him with indignation, and he would have   felt that even property is no absolute safeguard against the selfish   schemes of the mercenary and the rapacious.
