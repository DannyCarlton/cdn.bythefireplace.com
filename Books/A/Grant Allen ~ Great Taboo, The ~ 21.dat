That same afternoon Muriel had a visitor. M. Jules Peyron, formerly of  the College de France, no longer a mere Polynesian god, but a French  gentleman of the Boulevards in voice and manner, came to pay his  respects, as in duty bound, to Mademoiselle Ellis. M. Peyron had  performed his toilet under trying circumstances, to the best of his  ability. The remnants of his European clothes, much patched and overhung  with squares of native tappa cloth, were hidden as much as possible by a  wide feather cloak, very savage in effect, but more seemly, at any rate,  than the tattered garments in which Felix had first found him in his own  garden parterre. M. Peyron, however, was fully aware of the defects of  his costume, and profoundly apologetic. "It is with ten thousand regrets,  mademoiselle," he said, many times over, bowing low and simpering, "that  I venture to appear in a lady's <i>salon</i>--for, after all, wherever a  European lady goes, there her <i>salon</i> follows her--in such a <i>tenue</i>  as that in which I am now compelled to present myself. <i>Mais que  voulez-vous? Nous ne sommes pas a Paris</i>!" For to M. Peyron, as innocent  in his way as Mali herself, the whole world divided itself into Paris and  the Provinces.    
Nevertheless, it was touching to both the new-comers to see the  Frenchman's delight at meeting once more with civilized beings. "Figure  to yourself, mademoiselle," he said, with true French effusion--"figure  to yourself the joy and surprise with which I, this morning, receive  monsieur, your friend, at my humble cottage! For the first time after  nine years on this hateful island, I see again a European face; I hear  again the sound, the beautiful sound of that charming French language. My  emotion, believe me, was too profound for words. When monsieur was gone,  I retired to my hut, I sat down on the floor, I gave myself over to  tears, tears of joy and gratitude, to think I should once more catch a  glimpse of civilization! This afternoon, I ask myself, can I venture  to go out and pay my respects, thus attired, in these rags, to a European  lady? For a long time I doubt, I wonder, I hesitate. In my quality of  Frenchman, I would have wished to call in civilized costume upon a  civilized household. But what would you have? Necessity knows no law. I  am compelled to envelope myself in my savage robe of office as a  Polynesian god--a robe of office which, for the rest, is not without an  interest of its own for the scientific ethnologist. It belongs to me  especially as King of the Birds, and in it, in effect, is represented  at least one feather of each kind or color from every part of the body  of every species of bird that inhabits Boupari. I thus sum up, <i>pour  ainsi dire</i>, in my official costume all the birds of the island, as  Tu-Kila-Kila, the very high god, sums up, in his quaint and curious  dress, the land and the sea, the trees and the stones, earth and air, and  fire and water."    
Familiarity with danger begets at last a certain callous indifference.  Muriel was surprised in her own mind to discover how easily they could  chat with M. Peyron on such indifferent subjects, with that awful doom of  an approaching death hanging over them so shortly. But the fact was,  terrors of every kind had so encompassed them round since their arrival  on the island that the mere additional certainty of a date and mode of  execution was rather a relief to their minds than otherwise. It partook  of the nature of a reprieve, not of a sentence. Besides, this meeting  with another speaker of a European tongue seemed to them so full of  promise and hope that they almost forgot the terrors of their threatened  end in their discussion of possible schemes for escape to freedom. Even  M. Peyron himself, who had spent nine long years of exile in the island,  felt that the arrival of two new Europeans gave him some hope of  effecting at last his own retreat from this unendurable position. His  talk was all of passing steamers. If the Australasian had come near  enough once to sight the island, he argued, then the homeward-bound  vessel, <i>en route</i> for Honolulu, must have begun to take a new course  considerably to the eastward of the old navigable channel. If this were  so, their obvious plan was to keep a watch, day and night, for another  passing Australian liner, and whenever one hove in sight, to steal away  to the shore, seize a stray canoe, overpower, if possible, their Shadows,  or give them the slip, and make one bold stroke for freedom on the open  ocean.    
None of them could conceal from their own minds, to be sure, the extreme  difficulty of carrying out this programme. In the first place, it was a  toss-up whether they ever sighted another steamer at all; for during the  weeks they had already passed on the island, not a sign of one had  appeared from any quarter. Then, again, even supposing a steamer ever  hove in sight, what likelihood that they could make out for her in an  open canoe in time to attract attention before she had passed the island?  Tu-Kila-Kila would never willingly let them go; their Shadows would watch  them with unceasing care; the whole body of natives would combine  together to prevent their departure. If they ran away at all, they must  run for their lives; as soon as the islanders discovered they were gone,  every war-canoe in the place would be manned at once with bloodthirsty  savages, who would follow on their track with relentless persistence.    
As for Muriel, less prepared for such dangerous adventures than the two  men, she was rather inclined to attach a certain romantic importance (as  a girl might do) to the story of the parrot and the possible disclosures  which it could make if it could only communicate with them. The  mysterious element in the history of that unique bird attracted her  fancy. "The only one of its race now left alive," she said, with slow  reflectiveness. "Like Dolly Pentreath, the last old woman who could speak  Cornish! I wonder how long parrots ever live? Do you know at all,  monsieur? You are the King of the Birds--you ought to be an authority on  their habits and manners."    
The Frenchman smiled a gallant smile. "Unhappily, mademoiselle," he said,  "though, as a medical student, I took up to a certain extent biological  science in general at the College de France, I never paid any special or  peculiar attention in Paris to birds in particular. But it is the  universal opinion of the natives (if that counts for much) that parrots  live to a very great age; and this one old parrot of mine, whom I call  Methuselah on account of his advanced years, is considered by them all to  be a perfect patriarch. In effect, when the oldest men now living on the  island were little boys, they tell me that Methuselah was already a  venerable and much-venerated parrot. He must certainly have outlived all  the rest of his race by at least the best part of three-quarters of a  century. For the islanders themselves not infrequently live, by unanimous  consent, to be over a hundred."    
"I remember to have read somewhere," Felix said, turning it over in his  mind, "that when Humboldt was travelling in the wilds of South America he  found one very old parrot in an Indian village, which, the Indians  assured him, spoke the language of an extinct tribe, incomprehensible  then by any living person. If I recollect aright, Humboldt believed that  particular bird must have lived to be nearly a hundred and fifty."    
"That is so, monsieur," the Frenchman answered. "I remember the case  well, and have often recalled it. I recollect our professor mentioning it  one day in the course of his lectures. And I have always mentally coupled  that parrot of Humboldt's with my own old friend and subject, Methuselah.  However, that only impresses upon one more fully the folly of hoping that  we can learn anything worth knowing from him. I have heard him recite his  story many times over, though now he repeats it less frequently than he  used formerly to do; and I feel convinced it is couched in some unknown  and, no doubt, forgotten language. It is a much more guttural and  unpleasant tongue than any of the soft dialects now spoken in Polynesia.  It belonged, I am convinced, to that yet earlier and more savage race  which the Polynesians must have displaced; and as such it is now, I feel  certain, practically irrecoverable."    
"If they were more savage than the Polynesians," Muriel said, with a  profound sigh, "I'm sorry for anybody who fell into their clutches."    
"But what would not many philologists at home in England give," Felix  murmured, philosophically, "for a transcript of the words that parrot can  speak--perhaps a last relic of the very earliest and most primitive form  of human language!"    
At the very moment when these things were passing under the wattled roof  of Muriel's hut, it happened that on the taboo-space outside, Toko, the  Shadow, stood talking for a moment with Ula, the fourteenth wife of the  great Tu-Kila-Kila.    
"I never see you now, Toko," the beautiful Polynesian said, leaning  almost across the white line of coral-sand which she dared not  transgress. "Times are dull at the temple since you came to be Shadow to  the white-faced stranger."    
"It was for that that Tu-Kila-Kila sent me here," the Shadow answered,  with profound conviction. "He is jealous, the great god. He is bad. He is  cruel. He wanted to get rid of me. So he sent me away to the King of the  Rain that I might not see you."    
Ula pouted, and held up her wounded finger before his eyes  coquettishly. "See what he did to me," she said, with a mute appeal  for sympathy--though in that particular matter the truth was not in  her. "Your god was angry with me to-day because I hurt his hand, and  he clutched me by the throat, and almost choked me. He has a bad heart.  See how he bit me and drew blood. Some of these days, I believe, he will  kill me and eat me."    
The Shadow glanced around him suspiciously with an uneasy air. Then he  whispered low, in a voice half grudge, half terror, "If he does, he is a  great god--he can search all the world--I fear him much, but Toko's heart  is warm. Let Tu-Kila-Kila look out for vengeance."    
The woman glanced across at him open-eyed, with her enticing look. "If  the King of the Rain, who is Korong, knew all the secret," she murmured,  slowly, "he would soon be Tu-Kila-Kila himself; and you and I could then  meet together freely."    
The Shadow started. It was a terrible suggestion. "You mean to say--" he  cried; then fear overcame him, and, crouching down where he sat, he gazed  around him, terrified. Who could say that the wind would not report his  words to Tu-Kila-Kila?    
Ula laughed at his fears. "Pooh," she answered, smiling. "You are a man;  and yet you are afraid of a little taboo. I am a woman; and yet if I knew  the secret as you do, I would break taboo as easily as I would break an  egg-shell. I would tell the white-faced stranger all--if only it would  bring you and me together forever."    
"It is a great risk, a very great risk," the Shadow answered, trembling.  "Tu-Kila-Kila is a mighty god. He may be listening this moment, and may  pinch us to death by his spirits for our words, or burn us to ashes with  a flash of his anger."    
The woman smiled an incredulous smile. "If you had lived as near  Tu-Kila-Kila as I have," she answered, boldly, "you would think as  little, perhaps, of his divinity as I do."    
For even in Polynesia, superstitious as it is, no hero is a god to his  wives or his valets.
