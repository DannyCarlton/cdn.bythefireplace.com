  For half an hour Alan sat smoking his cigar. Mentally he was not at  ease. Mary Standish had come to him like a soldier, and she had left  him like a soldier. But in that last glimpse of her face he had caught  for an instant something which she had not betrayed in his cabin&#8212;a  stab of what he thought was pain in her tear-wet eyes as she smiled, a  proud regret, possibly a shadow of humiliation at last&#8212;or it may have  been a pity for him. He was not sure. But it was not despair. Not once  had she whimpered in look or word, even when the tears were in her  eyes, and the thought was beginning to impress itself upon him that it  was he&#8212;and not Mary Standish&#8212;who had shown a yellow streak this  night. A half shame fell upon him as he smoked. For it was clear he had  not come up to her judgment of him, or else he was not so big a fool as  she had hoped he might be. In his own mind, for a time, he was at a  loss to decide.
  It was possibly the first time he had ever deeply absorbed himself  in the analysis of a woman. It was outside his business. But, born and  bred of the open country, it was as natural for him to recognize  courage as it was for him to breathe. And the girl's courage was  unusual, now that he had time to think about it. It was this thought of  her coolness and her calm refusal to impose her case upon him with  greater warmth that comforted him after a little. A young and beautiful  woman who was actually facing death would have urged her necessity with  more enthusiasm, it seemed to him. Her threat, when he debated it  intelligently, was merely thrown in, possibly on the spur of the  moment, to give impetus to his decision. She had not meant it. The idea  of a girl like Mary Standish committing suicide was stupendously  impossible. Her quiet and wonderful eyes, her beauty and the exquisite  care which she gave to herself emphasized the absurdity of such a  supposition. She had come to him bravely. There was no doubt of that.  She had merely exaggerated the importance of her visit.
  Even after he had turned many things over in his mind to bolster up  this conclusion, he was still not at ease. Against his will he recalled  certain unpleasant things which had happened within his knowledge under  sudden and unexpected stress of emotion. He tried to laugh the absurd  stuff out of his thoughts and to the end that he might add a new color  to his visionings he exchanged his half-burned cigar for a black-bowled  pipe, which he filled and lighted. Then he began walking back and forth  in his cabin, like a big animal in a small cage, until at last he stood  with his head half out of the open port, looking at the clear stars and  setting the perfume of his tobacco adrift with the soft sea wind.
  He felt himself growing comforted. Reason seated itself within him  again, with sentiment shuttled under his feet. If he had been a little  harsh with Miss Standish tonight, he would make up for it by  apologizing tomorrow. She would probably have recovered her balance by  that time, and they would laugh over her excitement and their little  adventure. That is, he would. &#8220;I'm not at all curious in the matter,&#8221;  some persistent voice kept telling him, &#8220;and I haven't any interest in  knowing what irrational whim drove her to my cabin.&#8221; But he smoked  viciously and smiled grimly as the voice kept at him. He would have  liked to obliterate Rossland from his mind. But Rossland persisted in  bobbing up, and with him Mary Standish's words, &#8220;If I should make an  explanation, you would hate me,&#8221; or something to that effect. He  couldn't remember exactly. And he didn't want to remember exactly, for  it was none of his business.
  In this humor, with half of his thoughts on one side of the fence  and half on the other, he put out his light and went to bed. And he  began thinking of the Range. That was pleasanter. For the tenth time he  figured out how long it would be before the glacial-twisted ramparts of  the Endicott Mountains rose up in first welcome to his home-coming.  Carl Lomen, following on the next ship, would join him at Unalaska.  They would go on to Nome together. After that he would spend a week or  so in the Peninsula, then go up the Kobuk, across the big portage to  the Koyukuk and the far headwaters of the north, and still  farther&#8212;beyond the last trails of civilized men&#8212;to his herds and his  people. And Stampede Smith would be with him. After a long winter of  homesickness it was all a comforting inducement to sleep and pleasant  dreams. But somewhere there was a wrong note in his anticipations  tonight. Stampede Smith slipped away from him, and Rossland took his  place. And Keok, laughing, changed into Mary Standish with tantalizing  deviltry. It was like Keok, Alan thought drowsily&#8212;she was always  tormenting someone.
  He felt better in the morning. The sun was up, flooding the wall of  his cabin, when he awoke, and under him he could feel the roll of the  open sea. Eastward the Alaskan coast was a deep blue haze, but the  white peaks of the St. Elias Range flung themselves high up against the  sun-filled sky behind it, like snowy banners. The<I> Nome</I> was  pounding ahead at full speed, and Alan's blood responded suddenly to  the impelling thrill of her engines, beating like twin hearts with the  mighty force that was speeding them on. This was business. It meant  miles foaming away behind them and a swift biting off of space between  him and Unalaska, midway of the Aleutians. He was sorry they were  losing time by making the swing up the coast to Cordova. And with  Cordova he thought of Mary Standish.
  He dressed and shaved and went down to breakfast, still thinking of  her. The thought of meeting her again was rather discomforting, now  that the time of that possibility was actually at hand, for he dreaded  moments of embarrassment even when he was not directly accountable for  them. But Mary Standish saved him any qualms of conscience which he  might have had because of his lack of chivalry the preceding night. She  was at the table. And she was not at all disturbed when he seated  himself opposite her. There was color in her cheeks, a fragile touch of  that warm glow in the heart of the wild rose of the tundras. And it  seemed to him there was a deeper, more beautiful light in her eyes than  he had ever seen before.
  She nodded, smiled at him, and resumed a conversation which she had  evidently broken for a moment with a lady who sat next to her. It was  the first time Alan had seen her interested in this way. He had no  intention of listening, but something perverse and compelling overcame  his will. He discovered the lady was going up to teach in a native  school at Noorvik, on the Kobuk River, and that for many years she had  taught in Dawson and knew well the story of Belinda Mulrooney. He  gathered that Mary Standish had shown a great interest, for Miss  Robson, the teacher, was offering to send her a photograph she  possessed of Belinda Mulrooney; if Miss Standish would give her an  address. The girl hesitated, then said she was not certain of her  destination, but would write Miss Robson at Noorvik.
  &#8220;You will surely keep your promise?&#8221; urged Miss Robson.
  &#8220;Yes, I will keep my promise.&#8221;
  A sense of relief swept over Alan. The words were spoken so softly  that he thought she had not wanted him to hear. It was evident that a  few hours' sleep and the beauty of the morning had completely changed  her mental attitude, and he no longer felt the suspicion of  responsibility which had persisted in attaching itself to him. Only a  fool, he assured himself, could possibly see a note of tragedy in her  appearance now. Nor was she different at luncheon or at dinner. During  the day he saw nothing of her, and he was growing conscious of the fact  that she was purposely avoiding contact with him. This did not  displease him. It allowed him to pick up the threads of other interests  in a normal sort of way. He discussed Alaskan politics in the  smoking-room, smoked his black pipe without fear of giving offense, and  listened to the talk of the ship with a freedom of mind which he had  not experienced since his first meeting with Miss Standish. Yet, as  night drew on, and he walked his two-mile promenade about the deck, he  felt gathering about him a peculiar impression of aloneness. Something  was missing. He did not acknowledge to himself what it was until, as if  to convict him, he saw Mary Standish come out of the door leading from  her cabin passageway, and stand alone at the rail of the ship. For a  moment he hesitated, then quietly he came up beside her.
  &#8220;It has been a wonderful day, Miss Standish,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and Cordova  is only a few hours ahead of us.&#8221;
  She scarcely turned her face and continued to look off into the  shrouding darkness of the sea. &#8220;Yes, a wonderful day, Mr. Holt,&#8221; she  repeated after him, &#8220;and Cordova is only a few hours ahead.&#8221; Then, in  the same soft, unemotional voice, she added: &#8220;I want to thank you for  last night. You brought me to a great decision.&#8221;
  &#8220;I fear I did not help you.&#8221;
  It may have been fancy of the gathering dusk, that made him believe  he caught a shuddering movement of her slim shoulders.
  &#8220;I thought there were two ways,&#8221; she said, &#8220;but you made me see  there was only<I> one</I>.&#8221; She emphasized that word. It seemed to come  with a little tremble in her voice. &#8220;I was foolish. But please let us  forget. I want to think of pleasanter things. I am about to make a  great experiment, and it takes all my courage.&#8221;
  &#8220;You will win, Miss Standish,&#8221; he said in a sure voice. &#8220;In whatever  you undertake you will win. I know it. If this experiment you speak of  is the adventure of coming to Alaska&#8212;seeking your fortune&#8212;finding  your life here&#8212;it will be glorious. I can assure you of that.&#8221;
  She was quiet for a moment, and then said:
  &#8220;The unknown has always held a fascination for me. When we were  under the mountains in Skagway yesterday, I almost told you of an odd  faith which I have. I believe I have lived before, a long time ago,  when America was very young. At times the feeling is so strong that I  must have faith in it. Possibly I am foolish. But when the mountain  swung back, like a great door, and we saw Skagway, I knew that  sometime&#8212;somewhere&#8212;I had seen a thing like that before. And I have  had strange visions of it. Maybe it is a touch of madness in me. But it  is that faith which gives me courage to go on with my experiment.  That&#8212;and<I> you</I>!&#8221;
  Suddenly she faced him, her eyes flaming.
  &#8220;You&#8212;and your suspicions and your brutality,&#8221; she went on, her  voice trembling a little as she drew herself up straight and tense  before him. &#8220;I wasn't going to tell you, Mr. Holt. But you have given  me the opportunity, and it may do you good&#8212;after tomorrow. I came to  you because I foolishly misjudged you. I thought you were different,  like your mountains. I made a great gamble, and set you up on a  pedestal as clean and unafraid and believing all things good until you  found them bad&#8212;and I lost. I was terribly mistaken. Your first  thoughts of me when I came to your cabin were suspicious. You were  angry and afraid. Yes,<I> afraid</I>&#8212;fearful of something happening  which you didn't want to happen. You thought, almost, that I was  unclean. And you believed I was a liar, and told me so. It wasn't fair,  Mr. Holt. It wasn't<I> fair</I>. There were things which I couldn't  explain to you, but I told you Rossland knew. I didn't keep everything  back. And I believed you were big enough to think that I was not  dishonoring you with my&#8212;friendship, even though I came to your cabin.  Oh, I had that much faith in myself&#8212;I didn't think I would be mistaken  for something unclean and lying!&#8221;
  &#8220;Good God!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Listen to me&#8212;Miss Standish&#8212;&#8221;
  She was gone, so suddenly that his movement to intercept her was  futile, and she passed through the door before he could reach her.  Again he called her name, but her footsteps were almost running up the  passageway. He dropped back, his blood cold, his hands clenched in the  darkness, and his face as white as the girl's had been. Her words had  held him stunned and mute. He saw himself stripped naked, as she  believed him to be, and the thing gripped him with a sort of horror.  And she was wrong. He had followed what he believed to be good judgment  and common sense. If, in doing that, he had been an accursed fool&#8212;
  Determinedly he started for her cabin, his mind set upon correcting  her malformed judgment of him. There was no light coming under her  door. When he knocked, there was no answer from within. He waited, and  tried again, listening for a sound of movement. And each moment he  waited he was readjusting himself. He was half glad, in the end, that  the door did not open. He believed Miss Standish was inside, and she  would undoubtedly accept the reason for his coming without an apology  in words.
  He went to his cabin, and his mind became increasingly persistent in  its disapproval of the wrong viewpoint she had taken of him. He was not  comfortable, no matter how he looked at the thing. For her clear eyes,  her smoothly glorious hair, and the pride and courage with which she  had faced him remained with him overpoweringly. He could not get away  from the vision of her as she had stood against the door with tears  like diamonds on her cheeks. Somewhere he had missed fire. He knew it.  Something had escaped him which he could not understand. And she was  holding him accountable.
  The talk of the smoking-room did not interest him tonight. His  efforts to become a part of it were forced. A jazzy concert of piano  and string music in the social hall annoyed him, and a little later he  watched the dancing with such grimness that someone remarked about it.  He saw Rossland whirling round the floor with a handsome, young blonde  in his arms. The girl was looking up into his eyes, smiling, and her  cheek lay unashamed against his shoulder, while Rossland's face rested  against her fluffy hair when they mingled closely with the other  dancers. Alan turned away, an unpleasant thought of Rossland's  association with Mary Standish in his mind. He strolled down into the  steerage. The Thlinkit people had shut themselves in with a curtain of  blankets, and from the stillness he judged they were asleep. The  evening passed slowly for him after that, until at last he went to his  cabin and tried to interest himself in a book. It was something he had  anticipated reading, but after a little he wondered if the writing was  stupid, or if it was himself. The thrill he had always experienced with  this particular writer was missing. There was no inspiration. The words  were dead. Even the tobacco in his pipe seemed to lack something, and  he changed it for a cigar&#8212;and chose another book. The result was the  same. His mind refused to function, and there was no comfort in his  cigar.
  He knew he was fighting against a new thing, even as he  subconsciously lied to himself. And he was obstinately determined to  win. It was a fight between himself and Mary Standish as she had stood  against his door. Mary Standish&#8212;the slim beauty of her&#8212;her courage&#8212;a  score of things that had never touched his life before. He undressed  and put on his smoking-gown and slippers, repudiating the honesty of  the emotions that were struggling for acknowledgment within him. He was  a bit mad and entirely a fool, he told himself. But the assurance did  him no good.
  He went to bed, propped himself up against his pillows, and made  another effort to read. He half-heartedly succeeded. At ten o'clock  music and dancing ceased, and stillness fell over the ship. After that  he found himself becoming more interested in the first book he had  started to read. His old satisfaction slowly returned to him. He  relighted his cigar and enjoyed it. Distantly he heard the ship's  bells, eleven o'clock, and after that the half-hour and midnight. The  printed pages were growing dim, and drowsily he marked his book, placed  it on the table, and yawned. They must be nearing Cordova. He could  feel the slackened speed of the<I> Nome</I> and the softer throb of her  engines. Probably they had passed Cape St. Elias and were drawing  inshore.
  And then, sudden and thrilling, came a woman's scream. A piercing  cry of terror, of agony&#8212;and of something else that froze the blood in  his veins as he sprang from his berth. Twice it came, the second time  ending in a moaning wail and a man's husky shout. Feet ran swiftly past  his window. He heard another shout and then a voice of command. He  could not distinguish the words, but the ship herself seemed to  respond. There came the sudden smoothness of dead engines, followed by  the pounding shock of reverse and the clanging alarm of a bell calling  boats' crews to quarters.
  Alan faced his cabin door. He knew what had happened. Someone was  overboard. And in this moment all life and strength were gone out of  his body, for the pale face of Mary Standish seemed to rise for an  instant before him, and in her quiet voice she was telling him again  that<I> this was the other way.</I> His face went white as he caught up  his smoking-gown, flung open his door, and ran down the dimly lighted  corridor.
