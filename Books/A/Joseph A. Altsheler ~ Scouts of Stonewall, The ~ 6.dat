  The long winding lines of the two armies spread over a maze of  fields,  woods and thickets, with here and there a stone wall and  scattered low  hills, which could be used as points of strength.   Jackson's men, led by  able officers, were pushing forward with all  their might.  The woods,  the thickets and the mud nullified to some  extent the superior power of  the Northern artillery, but the rifles  were pouring forth shattering  volleys, many at close range. 
  Harry felt his horse stagger just after he reached the crest of the  hill,  but he took no notice of it until a few minutes later, when the  animal  began to shiver.  He leaped clear just in time, for when the  shiver  ceased, the horse plunged forward, fell on his side and lay  dead.  As Harry straightened himself on his feet a bullet went through  the brim  of his cap, and another clipped his epaulet. 
  &#8220;Those must be western men shooting at you, Harry,&#8221; said a voice  beside  him.  &#8220;But it could have been worse.  You're merely grazed,  when you  could have been hit and hit deep.&#8221; 
  It was Langdon, cool and imperturbable, who was speaking.  He was   regarding Harry rather quizzically, as the boy mechanically brushed  the  mud from his clothes. 
  &#8220;Force of habit,&#8221; said Langdon, and then he suddenly grasped Harry  and  pulled him to his knees.  There was a tremendous crash in front of  them,  and a storm of bullets swept over their heads. 
  &#8220;I saw a Yankee officer give the word, and then a million riflemen  rose  from the bushes and fired straight at us!&#8221; shouted Langdon.  &#8220;You  stay  here!  See the Invincibles are all about you!&#8221; 
  Harry saw that he had in truth fallen among the Invincibles.  There  was  St. Clair, immaculate, a blazing red spot in either cheek, gazing  at the  great swarms of riflemen in front.  Colonel Leonidas Talbot and   Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire, those veteran West Pointers,   were stalking up and down in front of their lines, fiercely bidding  their  men to lie down.  But Harry knew that his duty was elsewhere. 
  &#8220;I belong to the general!&#8221; he exclaimed.  &#8220;I must join him!&#8221; 
  Casting one glance of regret at the fallen horse that had served  him so  well he rushed toward General Jackson, who with the rest of his  staff had  dismounted.  The general, showing no emotion or anxiety, was  watching the  doubtful combat. 
  Along the whole line the battle was deepening.  The able West  Pointers on  the Northern side were hurrying forward fresh troops.   Shields himself  was coming with new battalions.  The men from Ohio  and the states further  west, expert like the Southerners in the use of  the rifle, and confident  of victory, were pouring a heavy and unbroken  fire upon the thinner  Southern lines.  They, too, knew the value of  cover and, cool enough to  think about it, they used every thicket, and  grove and ridge that they  could reach. 
  The roar of the battle was heard plainly in Winchester, and the  people of  the town, although it was now held by the North, wished  openly for the  success of the South.  The Northern troops, as it  happened, nearly all  through the war, were surrounded by people who  were against them.  The women at the windows and on the house tops  looked eagerly for the red  flare in the South which should betoken the  victorious advance of Jackson,  sweeping his enemies before him. 
  But Jackson was not advancing.  All the valor and courage of the  South so  far had been in vain.  Harry, standing near his commander,  and awaiting  any order that might be given him, saw new masses of the  enemy advancing  along every road and through the fields.  The Union  colors, held aloft in  front of the regiments, snapped defiantly in the  wind.  And those western  riflemen, from their cover, never ceased to  pour showers of bullets upon  the Southern lines.  They had already cut  a swath of dead, and many  wounded were dragging themselves to the  rear. 
  It seemed to Harry, looking over the field, that the battle was  lost.  The Northern troops were displaying more tenacity than the  Southern  officers had expected.  Moreover, they were two to one, in  strong  positions, and with a much superior artillery.  As he looked he  saw one  of the Virginia regiments reel back before the attack of much  greater  numbers and retreat in some disorder.  The victors came on,  shouting in  triumph, but in a few minutes their officers rallied them,  another  Virginia regiment rushed to their relief, and the two, united,  hurled  themselves upon the advancing enemy.  The Union troops were  driven back  with great loss, and Harry noticed that the fire from  their two great  batteries was weakening.  He could not keep from  shouting in joy, but he  was glad that the sound of his voice was  drowned in the thunder of the  battle. 
  General Jackson had no orders for him at present, and Harry watched  with  extraordinary fascination the battle which was unrolling itself  in film  after film before him.  He saw a stone fence running down the  center of a  field, and then he saw beyond it a great mass of Northern  infantry  advancing with bayonets shining and colors waving.  From his  own side a  regiment was running toward it. 
  Who would reach the fence first?  The pulses in Harry's temple beat  so  hard that they hurt.  He could not take his eyes from that terrible  race,  a race of human beings, a race of life and death.  The sun  blazed down on  the rival forces as they sped across the field.  But  the Southerners  reached the wall first.  Not in vain had Jackson  trained his foot cavalry  to march faster anywhere than any other  troops in the world. 
  Harry saw the Virginians sink down behind the fence, the crest of  which a  moment later blazed with fire for a long distance.  He saw the  whole  front line of the Northern troops disappear, while those behind  were  thrown into confusion.  The Southerners poured in a second volley  before  they could recover and the whole force broke and retreated.   Other troops  were brought up but in the face of everything the  Virginians held the  fence. 
  But Shields was an able officer.  Moreover he and Jackson had been  thrown  together in former years, and he knew him.  He divined some of  the  qualities of Jackson's mind, and he felt that the Southern  general,  the field being what it was, was going to push hardest at the  center.  He accumulated his own forces there in masses that increased  continually.  He had suffered a wound the previous day in a skirmish,  and he could not  be at the very front, but he delivered his orders  through Kimball,  who was in immediate command upon the field.  Five  regiments in reserve  were suddenly hurled forward and struck the  Confederates a tremendous  blow. 
  Harry saw these regiments emerge from the woods and thickets and he  saw  the gray lines reel before them.  Jackson, pointing toward this  new and  furious conflict, said to Harry: 
  &#8220;Jump on the horse there and tell the officer in command that he  must  stand firm at all hazards!&#8221; 
  Harry sprang upon a horse not his own, and galloped away.  The  moment he  came into view the western riflemen began to send bullets  toward him.  His horse was struck, but went on.  Another bullet found  him, and then a  third, which was mortal.  Harry leaped clear of the  second horse that had  been killed under him, and ran toward the  officer in charge of the  stricken troops.  But they were retreating  already.  They moved slowly,  but they moved backward. 
  Harry joined with the officers in their entreaties to the men to  stand,  but the pressure upon them was too great.  General Garnett, the  commander  of the Stonewall Brigade, had given an order of his own  accord to retreat,  and all that part of the line was falling back.   The Northern leader,  seeing the breach, continually pushed forward  fresh troops and more  cannon, while the deadly riflemen in the  thickets did more harm than the  great guns. 
  The Southerners were compelled to fall back.  One gun was lost.   Jackson  from the crest of the hill had seen with amazement the  retreat of the  famous Stonewall Brigade that he had once led in  person.  He galloped  across the field, reckless of bullets, and  fiercely bade Garnett turn and  hold his ground.  A drummer stood near  and Jackson, grasping him by the  shoulder with a firm right hand,  fairly dragged him to the crest of a  little hill, and bade him beat  the rally. 
  While Jackson still held him he gave the call to stand and fight.   But the Southerners could not.  The men in blue, intoxicated with  victory,  pushed forward in thousands and thousands.  Their heavy  masses overbore  all resistance.  Jackson, Garnett, Harry and all the  officers, young and  old were swept from the field by that flood,  crested with fire and steel.  It was impossible to preserve order and  cohesion.  The broken regiments  were swept back in a confused mass. 
  Jackson galloped about, trying to rally his men, and his staff gave  all  the help they could.  Harry was on foot once more, waving the  sword of  which he was so proud.  But nothing could stay the tremendous  pressure of  the Union army.  Their commanders always pushed them  forward and always  fresh men were coming.  Skilled cannoneers sent  grape shot, shell and  round shot whistling through the Southern ranks.   The Northern cavalry  whipped around the Southern flanks and despite  the desperate efforts of  Ashby, Sherburne, and the others, began to  clip off its wings. 
  Harry often wondered afterward how his life was preserved.  It  seemed  impossible that he could have escaped such a storm from rifle  and cannon,  but save for the slight scratches, sustained earlier in  the action,  he remained untouched.  He did not think of it at the  time, only of the  avalanche that was driving them back.  He saw before  him a vast red flame,  through which bayonets and faces of men showed,  ever coming nearer. 
  Now the North was sure of victory.  The shouts of joy ran up and  down  their whole front.  The batteries were pushed nearer and nearer,  and sent  in terrible volleys at short range.  The riflemen who had  done such  deadly work rose from the woods and thickets, and rushed  forward, loading  and firing as they came.  The Southern force seemed  to be nothing but a  hopeless mass of fugitives. 
  Anyone save Jackson would have despaired even of saving his army.   But he dreamed yet of victory.  He galloped back for a strong  detachment  of Virginians who had not yet come upon the field, but  could not get them  up in time to strike a heavy blow. 
  It was apparent even to Harry and all the other young lieutenants  that  the battle was lost.  He must have shed tears then, because  afterward he  found furrows in the mud and burned gunpowder on his  face.  The combat  now was not for victory, but for existence.  The  Southerners fought to  preserve the semblance of an army, and it was  well for them that they  were valiant Virginians led by a great genius,  and dauntless officers. 
  Stonewall Jackson, in this the only defeat he ever sustained in   independent command, never lost his head for a moment.  By gigantic   exertions he formed a new line at last.  The fresher troops covered  the  shattered regiments.  The retreating artillery was posted anew. 
  Jackson galloped back and forth on Little Sorrel.  Everywhere his  courage  and presence of mind brought the men back from despair to  hope.  Once  anew was proved the truth of Napoleon's famous maxim that  men are nothing,  a man everything.  The soldiers on the Northern side  were as brave as  those on the Southern but they were not led by one of  those flashing  spirits of war which emerge but seldom in the ages, men  who in all the  turmoil and confusion of battle can see what ought to  be done and who do  it. 
  The beaten Southern army, but a few thousands, now was formed anew  for a  last stand.  A portion of them seized a stone fence, and others  took  position in thick timber.  The cavalry of Turner Ashby raged back  and  forth, seeking to protect the flanks, and in the east, coming  shadows  showed that the twilight might yet protect the South from the  last blow. 
  Harry, in the thick of furious battle, had become separated from  his  commander.  He was still on foot and his sword had been broken at  the  hilt by a bullet, but he did not yet know it.  Chance threw him  once more  among the Invincibles.  He plunged through the smoke almost  into the arms  of Langdon. 
  &#8220;And here is our Harry again!&#8221; shouted the irrepressible South   Carolinian.  &#8220;Stonewall Jackson has lost a battle, but he hasn't lost  an  army.  Night and our courage will save us!  Here, take this rifle!&#8221; 
  He picked up a loaded rifle which some falling soldier had dropped  and  thrust it into Harry's hand. 
  The boy took the rifle and began mechanically to fire and load and  fire  again at the advancing blue masses.  He resolved himself for a  minute  into a private soldier, and shouted and fired with the rest.   The  twilight deepened and darkened in the east, but the battle did  not cease.  The Northern leaders, grim and determined men, seeing their  victory  sought to press it to the utmost, and always hurried forward  infantry,  cavalry and artillery.  Had the Southern army been commanded  by any other  than Jackson it would have been destroyed utterly. 
  Jackson, resourceful and unconquerable, never ceased his exertions.   Wherever he appeared he infused new courage into his men.  Harry had   seized a riderless horse and was once more in the saddle, following  his  leader, taking orders and helping him whenever he could.  The  Virginians  who had seized the stone fence and the wood held fast.  The  eye of  Jackson was on them, and they could do nothing else.  An Ohio  and a  Virginia regiment on either side lost and retook their colors  six times  each.  One of the flags had sixty bullets through it.  An  Indiana  regiment gave way, but reinforced by another from the state  rallied and  returned anew to the attack.  A Virginia regiment also  retreated but was  brought back by its colonel, and fought with fresh  courage. 
  The numerous Northern cavalry forced its way around the Southern  flanks,  and cut in on the rear, taking many prisoners.  Then the  horsemen  appeared in a great mass on the Southern left, and had not  time and  chance intervened at the last moment Stonewall Jackson might  have passed  into obscurity. 
  The increasing twilight was now just merging into night, and a wood   stretched between the Northern cavalry and the Southern flank.  The   Northern horsemen hesitated, not wishing to become entangled among  trees  and brush in the dark, and in a few minutes the Southern  infantry,  falling back swiftly after beating off the attacks on their  front,  passed out of the trap.  Sherburne and Funsten, two of Ashby's  most  valiant cavalry leaders, came up with their squadrons, and  covered the  retreat, fighting off the Northern horsemen as Jackson and  his army  disappeared in the woods, and night came over the lost field. 
  The Southern army retired, beaten, but sullen and defiant.  It did  not go  far, but stopped at a point where the supply train had been  placed.  Fires were built and some of the men ate, but others were so  much  exhausted that without waiting for food they threw themselves  upon the  ground, and in an instant were fast asleep. 
  Harry, for the moment, a prey to black despair, followed his  general.  Only one other officer, a major, was with him.  Harry watched  him closely,  but he did not see him show any emotion.  Little Sorrel  like his master,  although he had been under fire a hundred times, had  passed through the  battle without a scratch.  Now he walked forward  slowly, the reins lying  loose upon his neck. 
  Harry was not conscious of weariness.  He had made immense  exertions,  but his system was keyed so high by excitement that the  tension held  firmly yet a little longer.  The night had come on heavy  and dark.  Behind him he could hear the fitful sounds of the Northern  and Southern  cavalry still skirmishing with each other.  Before him he  saw dimly the  Southern regiments, retreating in ragged lines.  It was  almost more than  he could stand, and his feelings suddenly found vent  in an angry cry. 
  General Jackson heard him and understood. 
  &#8220;Don't be grieved, my boy,&#8221; he said quietly.  &#8220;This is only the  first  battle.&#8221; 
  The calm, unboastful courage strengthened Harry anew.  If he should   grieve how much more should the general who had led in the lost  battle,  and upon whom everybody would hasten to put the blame!  He  felt once more  that flow of courage and fire from Jackson to himself,  and he felt also  his splendid fortune in being associated with a man  whose acts showed all  the marks of greatness.  Like so many other  young officers, mere boys,  he was fast maturing in the furnace of a  vast war. 
  The general ceased to follow the troops, but turned aside into what   seemed to be a thin stretch of forest.  But Harry saw that the trees  grew  in rows and he exclaimed: 
  &#8220;An orchard!&#8221; 
  It seemed to strike Jackson's fancy. 
  &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;an orchard is a good place to sleep in.  Can't we  make  a fire here?  I fear that we shall have to burn some fence rails  tonight.&#8221; 
  Harry and the major&#8212;Hawks was his name&#8212;hitched the horses, and  gathered  a heap of dry fence rails.  The major set fire to splinters  with matches  and, in a few minutes a fine fire was crackling and  blazing, taking away  the sharp chill of the March night. 
  Harry saw other fires spring up in the orchard, and he went over to  one  of them, where some soldiers were cooking food. 
  &#8220;Give me a piece of meat and bread,&#8221; he said to a long Virginian. 
  &#8220;Set, Sonny, an' eat with us!&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't want it for myself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then who in nation are you beggin' fur?&#8221; 
  &#8220;For General Jackson.  He's sitting over there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thunderation!  The gen'ral himself!  Here, boy!&#8221; 
  Bearing a big piece of meat in one hand and a big piece of bread in  the  other Harry returned to Jackson, who had not yet tasted food that  day.  The general ate heartily, but almost unconsciously.  He seemed to  be in a  deep study.  Harry surmised that his thoughts were on the  morrow.  He had learned already that Stonewall Jackson always looked  forward. 
  Harry foraged and obtained more food for himself, and other  officers of  the staff who were coming up, some bearing slight wounds  that they  concealed.  He also secured the general's cloak, which was  strapped to  his saddle and insisted upon his putting it on. 
  The fire was surrounded presently by officers.  Major Hawks had  laid  together and as evenly as possible a number of fence rails upon  which  Jackson was to sleep, but as yet no one was disposed to slumber.   They  had finished eating, but they remained in a silent and somber  circle  about the fire. 
  Jackson stood up presently and his figure, wrapped in the long  cloak was  all dark.  The light did not fall upon his face.  All the  others looked  at him.  Among them was one of Ashby's young troopers, a  bold and  reckless spirit.  It was a time, too, when the distinction  between  officers and privates in the great citizen armies was not yet  sharply  defined.  And this young trooper, some spirit of mockery  urging him on,  stood up and said to his general: 
  &#8220;The Yankees didn't seem to be in any hurry to leave Winchester,  did they,  general?&#8221; 
  Harry drew a quick, sharp breath, and there was a murmur among the   officers, but Stonewall Jackson merely turned a tranquil look upon the   presumptuous youth.  Then he turned it back to the bed of coals and  said  in even tones: 
  &#8220;Winchester is a pleasant town to stay in, sir.&#8221; 
  The young cavalryman, not abashed at all, continued: 
  &#8220;We heard the Yankees were retreating, but I guess they're  retreating  after us.&#8221; 
  Harry half rose and so did several of the older officers, but  Jackson  replied quietly: 
  &#8220;I think I may tell you, young sir, that I am satisfied with the  result.&#8221; 
  The audacity of the youthful trooper could not carry him further.   He caught threatening looks from the officers and slipped away in the   darkness.  Silence fell anew around the fire, and Jackson still stood,   gazing into the coals.  Soon, he turned abruptly, strode away into the   darkness, but came back after a while, lay down on the fence rails and   slept soundly. 
  Harry put four or five rails side by side to protect his body from  the  cold ground, lay down upon them and threw a cloak over himself.   Now he  relaxed or rather collapsed completely.  The tension that had  kept him up  so long was gone, and he felt that he could not have risen  from the rails  had he wished.  He saw wavering fires and dusky figures  beside them,  but sleep came in a few minutes to soothe and heal. 
  Bye and bye all the army, save the sentinels, slept and the  victorious  Northern army only two or three miles away also slept,  feeling that it  had done enough for one day. 
  Shields that night was sending messages to the North announcing his   victory, but he was cherishing no illusions.  He told how fierce had  been  the attack, and with what difficulty it had been beaten off, and  in  Washington, reading well between the lines they felt that another  attack  and yet others might come from the same source. 
  Harry sleeping on his bed of fence rails did not dream of the   extraordinary things that the little army of Jackson, beaten at  Kernstown  was yet to do.  McClellan was just ready to start his great  army by sea  for the attack on Richmond, when suddenly the forgotten or  negligible  Jackson sprang out of the dark and fixed himself on his  flank. 
  The capital, despite victory, was filled with alarm and the  President  shared it.  The veteran Shields knew this man who had led  the attack,  and he did not seek to hide the danger.  The figure of  Stonewall Jackson,  gigantic and menacing, showed suddenly through the  mists.  If McClellan  went on to Richmond with the full Northern  strength he might launch  himself on Washington. 
  The great scheme of invasion was put out of joint.  Shields,  although  victorious for the time, could not believe that Jackson would  attack with  so small an army unless he expected reinforcements, and he  sent swift  expresses to bring back a division of 8,000 men which was  marching to  cover Washington.  Banks, his superior officer, on the way  to Washington,  too, heard the news at Harper's Ferry and halted there,  and Lincoln,  detaching a whole corps of nearly 40,000 men from  McClellan's army,  ordered them to remain at Manassas to protect the  capital against  Jackson.  A dispatch was sent to Banks ordering him to  push the valley  campaign with his whole strength. 
  But when Harry rose the next morning from his fence rails he knew  nothing  of these things.  Nor did anyone else in the Southern army,  unless it was  Stonewall Jackson who perhaps half-divined them.  Harry  thought afterward  that he had foreseen much when he said to the  impudent cavalryman that he  was satisfied with the result at  Kernstown. 
  They lingered there a little and then began a retreat, unharrassed  by  pursuit.  Scouts of the enemy were seen by Ashby's cavalry, who  hung like  a curtain between them and the army, but no force strong  enough to do any  harm came in sight.  Harry had secured another horse  and most of his duty  was at the rear, where he was often sent by the  general to get the latest  news from Ashby. 
  He quickly met Sherburne over whose dress difficulties had  triumphed at  last.  His fine cloak, rent in many places, was stained  with mud and  there was one large dark spot made by his own blood.  His  face was lined  deeply by exhaustion and deep disappointment. 
  &#8220;They were too much for us this time, Harry,&#8221; he said bitterly.   &#8220;We  can't beat two to one all the time.  How does the general take  it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;As if it were nothing.  He'll be ready to fight again in a few  days,  and we must have struck a hard blow anyhow.  The enemy are not  pursuing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's true,&#8221; said Sherburne more cheerfully.  &#8220;Your argument is a  good  one.&#8221; 
  The army came to a ridge called Rude's Hill and stopped there.   Harry was  already soldier enough to see that it was a strong  position.  Before it  flowed a creek which the melting snows in the  mountains had swollen to a  depth of eight or ten feet, and on another  side was a fork of the  Shenandoah, also swollen.  Here the soldiers  began to fortify and prepare  for a longer stay while Jackson sent for  aid. 
  Harry was not among the messengers for help.  Jackson had learned  his  great ability as a scout, and now he often sent him on missions of   observation, particularly with Captain Sherburne, to whom St. Clair  and  Langdon were also loaned by Colonel Talbot.  Thus the three were  together  when they rode with Sherburne and a hundred men a few days  after their  arrival at the ridge. 
  They were well wrapped in great coats, because the weather, after   deceiving for a while with the appearance of spring, had turned cold   again.  The enemy's scouts and spies were keeping back, where they  could  blow on their cold fingers or walk a while to restore the  circulation to  their half frozen legs. 
  Sherburne was his neat and orderly self again and St. Clair was  fully his  equal.  Langdon openly boasted that he was going to have a  dressing  contest between them for large stakes as soon as the war was  over.  But all the young Southerners were in good spirits now.  They  had learned  of the alarm caused in the North by Kernstown, and that a  third of  McClellan's army had been detached to guard against them.   Nor had Banks  and Shields yet dared to attack them. 
  &#8220;There's what troubles Banks,&#8221; said Sherburne, pointing with his  saber to  a towering mass of mountains which rose somber and dark in  the very  center of the Shenandoah Valley.  &#8220;He doesn't know which side  of the  Massanuttons to take.&#8221; 
  Harry looked up at these peaks and ridges, famous now in the minds  of all  Virginians, towering a half mile in the air, clothed from base  to summit  with dense forest of oak and pine, although today the crests  were wrapped  in snowy mists.  They cut the Shenandoah valley into two  smaller valleys,  the wider and more nearly level one on the west.   Only a single road by  which troops could pass crossed the  Massanuttons, and that road was held  by the cavalry of Ashby. 
  &#8220;If Banks comes one way and he proves too strong for us we can  cross over  to the other,&#8221; said Sherburne.  &#8220;If he divides his force,  marching into  both valleys, we may beat one part of his army, then  pass the mountain  and beat the other.&#8221; 
  Sherburne had divined aright.  It was the mighty mass of the  Massanuttons  that weighed upon Banks.  As he looked up at the dark  ridges and misty  crests his mind was torn by doubts.  His own forces,  great in number  though they were, were scattered.  Fremont to his  right on the slopes of  the Alleghanies had 25,000 men; there were  other strong detachments under  Milroy and Schenck, and he had 17,000  men under his own eye.  So he was  hesitating while the days were  passing and Jackson growing stronger. 
  &#8220;I suppose the nature of the country helps us a lot,&#8221; said Harry as  he  looked up at the Massanuttons, following Sherburne's pointing  saber. 
  &#8220;It does, and we need help,&#8221; said Sherburne.  &#8220;Even as it is they  would  have been pushing upon us if it hadn't been for the cavalry and  the  artillery.  Every time a detachment advanced we'd open up on it  with a  masked battery from the woods, and if pickets showed their  noses too  close horsemen were after them in a second.  We've had them  worried to  death for days and days, and when they do come in force Old  Jack will  have something up his sleeve.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Harry.
