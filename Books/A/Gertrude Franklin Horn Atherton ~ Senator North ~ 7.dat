That evening, as Betty was rummaging through a cupboard in the library  looking for a seal, she came upon a box of Cuban cigars. They could  have been her father's only and of his special importation: he had  smoked the choicest tobacco that Havana had been able to furnish.    
She knew that many men would prize that box of cigars, carefully  packed in lead and ripened by time, and she suddenly determined to  send it to Senator North. She felt that it would be an acute pleasure  to give him something, and as for the cigars they were too good for  any one else. She took the box to her room and wrapped it up carefully  and badly; but when she came to the note which must accompany it, she  paused before the difficulties which mechanically presented  themselves. Senator North might naturally feel surprise to receive a  present from a young woman with whom he had talked exactly six  minutes. If she wrote playfully, offering a small tribute at the  shrine of statesmanship, he might wonder if she worked slippers for  handsome young clergymen and burned candles before the photograph of a  popular tenor. She might send them anonymously, but that would not  give her the least satisfaction. Finally, she reluctantly decided  to wait until she met him again and could lead the conversation up to  cigars. "Perhaps he will see me in the gallery to-morrow," she  thought.    
But although he sat in his comfortable revolving-chair for two hours  the next afternoon, he never lifted his eyes to the gallery. She heard  several brief and excellent speeches, but went home dissatisfied. On  the day after her return from New York, whither she went to perform  the duty of bridesmaid; she had a similar experience, twice varied.  Senator Burleigh made a short speech in a voice that was truly  magnificent, and following up Senator North's attack on the bill  unpopular on the Republican side of the Chamber. He was answered by  "Blunderbuss" Pepper, the new Senator who had turned every aristocrat  out of office in his aristocratic Southern State and filled the  vacancies with men of his own humble origin. He was a burly untidy-  looking man, and frequently as uncouth in speech, a demagogue and  excitable. But the Senate, now that three years in that body had toned  him down, conceded his ability and took his abuse with the utmost  good-nature. Betty recalled his biography as sketched by Senator  Burleigh, and noted that almost every Senator wheeled about with an  expression of lively interest, as his reiterated "Mr. President, Mr.  President," secured him the floor. They were not disappointed, nor was  Betty. In a few moments he was roaring like a mad bull and hurling  invective upon the entire Republican Party, which "would deprive the  South of legitimate representation if it could." He was witty and  scored many points, provoking more than one laugh from both sides of  the Chamber; and when he finished with a parting yell of imprecation,  his audience returned to their correspondence and conversation with an  indulgent smile. Betty wondered what he had been like before the  Senate had "toned him down."    
That night she addressed the cigars to Jack Emory and sent them off at  once. "I do believe I came very close to making a fool of myself," she  thought. "What on earth made me want to give those cigars to Senator  North?--to give him anything? What a little ninny he would have  thought me!" She puzzled long over this deflection from her usual  imperious course with men, but concluding that women having so many  silly twists in their brains, it was useless to try to understand  them all, dismissed the matter from her mind.
