    It so happened that Hector was well provided with money. During the   life of Mr. Roscoe, whom he regarded as his father, he had a liberal   allowance&#8212;liberal beyond his needs&#8212;and out of it had put by   somewhat over a hundred dollars. The greater part of this was   deposited for safe-keeping in a savings bank, but he had twenty-five   dollars in his possession. 
  At the time he was saving his money, he regarded himself as the  heir  and future possessor of the estate, and had no expectation of  ever  needing it. It had been in his mind that it would give him an   opportunity of helping, out of his private funds, any deserving poor   person who might apply to him. When the unexpected revelation had   been made to him that he had no claim to the estate, he was glad  that  he was not quite penniless. He did not care to apply for money  to  Allan Roscoe. It would have been a confession of dependence, and  very  humiliating to him. 
  No sooner was school out, than he asked Wilkins to accompany him to   the baker's, that he might make up for the deficiencies of Mr.   Smith's meager table. 
  &quot;I suppose, if I guide you, you'll stand treat, Roscoe?&quot; said   Wilkins. 
  &quot;Of course.&quot; 
  &quot;Then let us go,&quot; said his schoolfellow, with alacrity. &quot;I'd like  to  get the taste of that beastly dinner out of my mouth.&quot; 
  They found the baker's, but close beside it was a restaurant, where   more substantial fare could be obtained. 
  &quot;Wilkins,&quot; said Hector, &quot;I think I would rather have a plate of   meat.&quot; 
  &quot;All right! I'm with you.&quot; 
  So the two boys went into the restaurant, and ordered plates of   roast beef, which they ate with evident enjoyment. 
  &quot;I guess,&quot; said the waiter, grinning, &quot;you two chaps come from the   institute.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; answered Hector. &quot;What makes you think so?&quot; 
  &quot;The way you eat. They do say old Smith half starves the boys.&quot; 
  &quot;You're not far from right,&quot; said Wilkins; &quot;but it isn't alone the   quantity, but the quality that's amiss.&quot; 
  They ate their dinner, leaving not a crumb, and then rose  refreshed. 
  &quot;I feel splendid,&quot; said Wilkins. &quot;I just wish I boarded at the   restaurant instead of the doctor's. Thank you, Roscoe, for inviting   me.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, Wilkins! We'll come again some day.&quot; 
  Somehow the extra dinner seemed to warm the heart of Wilkins, and   inspire in him a feeling of friendly interest for Hector. 
  &quot;I say, Hector, I'll tell you something.&quot; 
  &quot;Go ahead.&quot; 
  &quot;You've got to keep your eyes open.&quot; 
  &quot;I generally do,&quot; answered Hector, smiling, &quot;except at night.&quot; 
  &quot;I mean when Jim Smith's round.&quot; 
  &quot;Why particularly when he is around?&quot; 
  &quot;Because he means to thrash you.&quot; 
  &quot;What for?&quot; 
  &quot;You are too independent. You don't bow down to him, and look up to   him.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't mean to,&quot; said Hector, promptly. 
  &quot;If you don't you'll see trouble, and that very soon.&quot; 
  &quot;Let it come!&quot; said Hector, rather contemptuously. 
  &quot;You don't seem afraid!&quot; said Wilkins, regarding him curiously. 
  &quot;Because I am not afraid. Isn't that a good reason?&quot; 
  &quot;You don't think you can stand up against Jim, do you?&quot; 
  &quot;I will see when the time comes.&quot; 
  &quot;I shouldn't be a bit surprised if he were looking out for you at   this very moment, and wondering where you are.&quot; 
  It seemed that Wilkins was right. As they approached the school   grounds, John Bates came running to meet them. 
  &quot;Where have you been, you two?&quot; he said. 
  &quot;To the village,&quot; answered Wilkins. 
  &quot;What for?&quot; 
  &quot;For a walk,&quot; answered Wilkins, with a warning glance at Hector. It   would have been awkward if the principal had heard that they had  been  compelled to eke out their meager dinner at a restaurant. 
  &quot;Well, Jim wants you. Leastways, he wants Roscoe.&quot; 
  Bates looked as if he expected Roscoe would immediately hasten to   comply with the wishes of the redoubtable Jim. 
  &quot;If he wants me, he can come to me,&quot; said Hector, independently. 
  &quot;But I say, that won't do. Jim won't be satisfied.&quot; 
  &quot;Won't he? I don't know that that particularly concerns me.&quot; 
  &quot;Shall I tell him that?&quot; 
  &quot;If you choose.&quot; 
  Bates looked as if Hector had been guilty of some enormity. What,   defy the wishes, the mandates, of Jim Smith, the king of the school   and the tyrant of all the small boys! He felt that Hector Roscoe was   rushing on his fate. 
  &quot;I advise you to come,&quot; he said, &quot;Jim's mad with you already, and   he'll lick you worse if you send him a message like that.&quot; 
  &quot;He will probably have to take blows, as well as give them,&quot; said   Hector. 
  &quot;Then I am to tell him what you said?&quot; 
  &quot;Of course.&quot; 
  With a look that seemed to say, &quot;Your fate be on your own head!&quot;   Bates walked away. 
  &quot;John Bates is always toadying to Jim,&quot; said Wilkins. &quot;So he's  prime  favorite when Jim is good-natured&#8212;when he's cross, I've seen  him  kick Bates.&quot; 
  &quot;And Bates didn't resent it?&quot; 
  &quot;He didn't dare to. He'd come round him the next day the same as   ever.&quot; 
  &quot;Has the boy no self-respect?&quot; asked Hector, in a tone of disgust. 
  &quot;He doesn't seem to have.&quot; 
  As soon as school was out, Jim Smith had looked round for the new   boy, who seemed disposed to defy his authority. On account of eating   at different tables, they had not met during the noon intermission.   At any rate, there had not been time to settle the question of   subserviency. Through the afternoon session Jim had been  anticipating  the signal punishment which he intended to inflict upon  the newcomer. 
  &quot;I'll show him!&quot; he said to himself. &quot;Tomorrow he'll be singing a   different tune, or I am mistaken.&quot; 
  This was the way Jim had been accustomed to break in refractory new   arrivals. The logic of his fist usually proved a convincing  argument,  and thus far his supremacy had never been successfully  resisted. He  was confident that he would not be interfered with.  Secretly, his  Uncle Socrates sympathized with him, and relished the  thought that his  nephew, who so strongly resembled him in mind and  person, should be  the undisputed boss&#8212;to use a word common in  political circles&#8212;of the  school. He discreetly ignored the  conflicts which he knew took place,  and if any luckless boy, the  victim of Jim's brutality, ventured to  appeal to him, the boy soon  found that he himself was arraigned, and  not the one who had abused  him. 
  &quot;Where's that new boy?&quot; asked Jim, as he left the schoolroom. 
  He had not seen our hero's departure&#8212;but his ready tool, Bates,   had. 
  &quot;I saw him sneaking off with Wilkins,&quot; said Bates. 
  &quot;Where did they go?&quot; 
  &quot;To the Village, I guess.&quot; 
  &quot;They seemed to be in a hurry,&quot; said Jim, with a sneer. 
  &quot;They wanted to get out of your way&#8212;that is, the new boy did,&quot;   suggested Bates. 
  Jim nodded. 
  &quot;Likely he did,&quot; he answered. &quot;So he went to the village, did he?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I saw him.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, he's put it off a little. That boy's cranky. I'm goin' to   give him a lesson he won't forget very soon.&quot; 
  &quot;So you will, so you will, Jim,&quot; chuckled Bates. 
  &quot;That's the way I generally take down these boys that put on airs,&quot;   said Jim, complacently. &quot;This Roscoe's the worst case I've had yet.   So Wilkins went off with him, did he?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I saw them go off together.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll have to give Wilkins a little reminder, then. It won't be  safe  to take up with them that defy me. I'll just give him a kick to  help  his memory.&quot; 
  &quot;He won't like that much, oh, my!&quot; chuckled Bates. 
  &quot;When you see them coming, Bates, go and tell Roscoe I want to see   him,&quot; said Jim, with the air of an autocrat. 
  &quot;All right, Jim,&quot; said Bates, obediently. 
  So he went on his errand, and we know what success he met with.
