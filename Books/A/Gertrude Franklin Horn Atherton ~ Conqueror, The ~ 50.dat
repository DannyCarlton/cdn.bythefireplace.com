When the 17th of June approached, Hamilton, John Jay, Chancellor  Livingston, and James Duane, started on horse for Poughkeepsie, not  daring, with Clinton on the spot, and the menace of an immediate  adjournment, to trust to the winds of the Hudson. General Schuyler had  promised to leave even a day sooner from the North, and the majority of  Federal delegates had gone by packet-boat, or horse, in good season.    
The old post road between New York and Albany was, for the greater part  of the way, but a rough belt through a virgin forest. Occasionally a  farmer had cleared a few acres, the lawns of a manor house were open to  the sun, the road was varied by the majesty of Hudson and palisade for a  brief while, or by the precipitous walls of mountains, so thickly wooded  that even the wind barely fluttered their sombre depths. Man was a  moving arsenal in those long and lonely journeys, for the bear and the  panther were breeding undisturbed. But the month was hot, and those  forest depths were very cool; the scenery was often as magnificent as  primeval, and a generous hospitality at many a board dispelled, for an  interval, the political anxiety of Hamilton and his companions.    
Hamilton, despite a mind trained to the subordination of private  interests to public duty, knew that it was the crisis of his own destiny  toward which he was hastening. He had bound up his personal ambitions  with the principles of the Federalist party--so called since the  publication in book form of the Publius essays; for not only was he  largely responsible for those principles, but his mind was too well  regulated to consider the alternative of a compromise with a possibly  victorious party which he detested. Perhaps his ambition was too  vaulting to adapt itself to a restricted field when his imagination had  played for years with the big ninepins of history; at all events, it was  inseparably bound up with nationalism in the boldest sense achievable,  and with methods which days and nights of severe thought had convinced  him were for the greatest good of the American people. Union meant  Washington in the supreme command, himself with the reins of government  in both hands. The financial, the foreign, the domestic policy of a  harmonious federation were as familiar to his mind as they are to us  to-day. Only he could achieve them, and only New York could give him  those reins of power.    
It is true that he had but to move his furniture over to Philadelphia to  be welcomed to citizenship with acclamation by that ambitious town; but  not only was his pride bound up in the conquest of New York from  Clintonism to Federalism, but New York left out of the Union, dividing  as she did New England from the South and North, of the highest  commercial importance by virtue of her central position and her harbour,  meant civil war at no remote period, disunion, and the undoing of the  most careful and strenuous labours of the nation's statesmen. That New  York should be forced into the Union at once Hamilton was determined  upon, if he had to resort to a coup which might or might not meet with  the approval of the rest of the country. Nevertheless, he looked forward  to the next few weeks with the deepest anxiety. An accident, an illness,  and the cause was lost, for he made no mistake in estimating himself as  the sole force which could bear Clinton and his magnificent organization  to the ground. Hamilton was no party manipulator. He relied upon his  individual exertions, abetted by those of his lieutenants,--the most  high-minded and the ablest men in the country,--to force his ideas upon  the masses by their own momentum and weight. Indeed, so individual did  he make the management of the Federalist party, that years later, when  the "Republican" leaders determined upon its overthrow, they aimed all  their artillery at him alone: if he fell the party must collapse, on top  of him; did he retain the confidence of the people, he would magnetize  their obedience, no matter what rifts there might be in his ranks.    
He had established a horse-express between Virginia and Poughkeepsie,  and between New Hampshire and the little capital. Eight States having  ratified, the signature of New Hampshire, the next in order, would mean  union and a trial of the Constitution, a prospect which could not fail  to influence the thinking men of the anti-Federal party; but it was from  the ratification of Virginia that he hoped the greatest good. This State  occupied much the same position in the South that New York did in the  North, geographically, commercially, historically, and in the  importance of her public men. And she was as bitterly opposed to union,  to what a narrow provincialism held to be the humiliation of the States.  Patrick Henry, her most powerful and eloquent leader, not through the  selfish policy of a Clinton, but in the limitations of a too narrow  genius, was haranguing with all his recuperated might against the  sinister menace to the liberties of a people who had freed themselves of  one despotism so dearly; and even Randolph, with characteristic  hesitancy when approaching a point, was deficient in enthusiasm,  although he intimated that he should vote for the unconditional adoption  of the Constitution he had refused to sign. He and Marshall were  Madison's only assistants of importance against the formidable opponent  of union, and it was well understood among leaders that Jefferson, who  was then American minister in France, gave the Constitution but a  grudging and inconsistent approval, and would prefer that it failed,  were not amendments tacked on which practically would nullify its  energies. But although Hamilton had such lieutenants as John Jay, Philip  Schuyler, Duane, and Robert Livingston, Madison had the inestimable,  though silent, backing of Washington. The great Chief had, months since,  forcibly expressed his sentiments in a public letter; and that colossal  figure, the more potent that it was invisible and mute, guided as many  wills as Madison's strenuous exertions and unanswerable dispassionate  logic.    
But Washington, although sufficiently revered by New Yorkers, was not  their very own, as was he the Virginians'; was by no means so impinging  and insistent as his excellency, Governor Clinton, he whose powerful  will and personality, aided by an enterprise and wisdom that were not  always misguided, for eleven years had compelled their grateful  submission. It was difficult to convince New Yorkers that such a man was  wholly wrong in his patriotism, particularly when their own interests  seemed bound so firmly to his. It was this dominant, dauntless,  resourceful, political nabob that Hamilton knew he must conquer  single-handed, if he conquered him at all; for his lieutenants, able as  they were, could only second and abet him; they had none of his  fertility of resource. As he rode through the forest he rehearsed every  scheme of counterplay and every method that made for conquest which his  fertile brain had conceived. He would exercise every argument likely to  appeal to the decent instincts of those ambitious of ranking as  first-class citizens, as well as to the congenital selfishness of man,  which could illuminate the darker recesses of their Clintonized  understandings, and effect their legitimate conversion; then, if these  higher methods failed, coercion.    
"What imperious method are you devising, Hamilton?" asked Livingston.  "Your lips are set; your eyes are almost black. I've seen you like that  in court, but never in good company before. You look as if considering a  challenge to mortal combat."    
Hamilton's brow cleared, and he laughed with that mercurial lightness  which did more to preserve the balance of what otherwise would have been  an overweighted mind than any other quality it possessed.    
"Well, am I not to fight a duel?" he asked. "Would that I could call  Clinton out and settle the question as easily as that. I disapprove of  duelling, but so critical a moment as this would justify anything short  of trickery. We'll leave that to Clinton; but although there is no vast  difference between my political and my private conscience, there are  recourses which are as fair in political as in martial warfare, and I  should be found ingenuous and incapable did I fail to make use of them."    
"Well, you love a fight," said Jay, without experiencing the humour of  his remark. "I believe you would rather fight than sit down in good  company at any time, and you are notoriously convivial. But easy  conquest would demoralize you. If I do not mistake, you have the  greatest battle of your career, past or present, immediately ahead of  you--and it means so much to all of us--I fear--I fear--"    
"I will listen to no fears," cried Hamilton, who at all events had no  mind to be tormented by any but his own. "Are we not alive? Are we not  in health? Are not our intellectual powers at their ripest point of  development? Can Clinton, Melancthon Smith, Yates, Lansing, Jones, make  a better showing?"    
"We are nineteen against forty-six," said Jay, with conceivable gloom.    
"True. But there is no reason why we should not shortly be forty-six  against nineteen."    
"We certainly are Right against the most unstatesman-like Selfishness  the world has ever seen," observed Duane.    
"Would that experience justified us in thinking well enough of the human  race to gather courage from that fact," replied Hamilton. "It is to the  self-interest of the majority we shall have to appeal. Convince them  that there is neither career nor prosperity for them in an isolated  State, and we may drag them up to a height which is safer than their  mire, simply because it is better, or better because it is safer. This  is a time to practice patriotism, but not to waste time talking about  it."    
"Your remarks savour of cynicism," replied Jay, "but I fear there is  much truth in them. It is only in the millennium, I suppose, that we  shall have the unthinkable happiness of seeing on all sides of us an  absolute conformity to our ideals."    
In spite of the close, if somewhat formal, friendship between Jay and  Hamilton, the latter was often momentarily depressed by the resemblance  of this flawless character to, and its rigid contrasts from, his dead  friend Laurens. Jay was all that Laurens had passionately wished to be,  and apparently without effort; for nature had not balanced him with a  redeeming vice, consequently with no power to inspire hate or love. Had  he been a degree greater, a trifle more ambitious, or had circumstances  isolated him in politics, he would have been an even lonelier and  loftier figure than Washington, for our Chief had one or two redeeming  humanities; as it was, he stood to a few as a character so perfect that  they marvelled, while they deplored his lack of personal influence. But  his intellect is in the rank which stands just beneath that of the men  of genius revealed by history, and he hangs like a silver star of the  tropics upon the sometimes dubious fields of our ancestral heavens.  Nevertheless, he frequently inspired Hamilton with so poignant a longing  for Laurens that our impetuous hero was tempted to wish for an exchange  of fates.    
"In the millennium we will all tell the truth and hate each other,"  answered Hamilton. "And we either shall all be fools, or those irritants  will be extinct; in any case we shall be happy, particularly if we have  someone to hate."    
"Ah, now you jest," said Duane, smiling. "For you are logical or  nothing. <i>You</i> may be happy when on the warpath, but the rest of us are  not. And you are the last man to be happy in a millennium by yourself."    
They all laughed at this sally, for Hamilton was seldom silent. He  answered lightly:--    
"Someone to fight. Someone to love. Three warm friends. Three hot  enemies. A sufficiency of delicate food and wine. A West Indian  swimming-bath. Someone to talk to. Someone to make love to. War.  Politics. Books. Song. Children. Woman. A religion. There you have the  essence of the millennium, embroider it as you may."    
"And scenery," added Jay, devoutly.    
The road for the last quarter of an hour had led up a steep hill, above  which other hills piled without an opening; and below lay the Hudson. As  they paused upon the bare cone of the elevation, the river looked like a  chain of Adirondack lakes, with dense and upright forests rising tier  beyond tier until lost in the blue haze of the Catskills. The mountains  looked as if they had pushed out from the mainland down to the water's  edge to cross and meet each other. So close were the opposite crags that  the travellers could see a deer leap through the brush, the red of his  coat flashing through the gloomy depths. Below sped two packet-boats in  a stiff breeze.    
"Friends or enemies?" queried Livingston. "I wish I were with them, for  I must confess the pleasures of horse travel for seventy-five miles must  be the climax of a daily habit to be fully appreciated. It is all very  well for Hamilton, who is on a horse twice every day; but as I am ten  years older and proportionately stiffer, I shall leave patriotism to the  rest of you for a day or two after our arrival."    
Hamilton did not answer. He had become conscious of the delicate yet  piercing scent of violets. Wild violets had no perfume, and it was long  past their season. He glanced eagerly around, but without realizing what  prompted a quick stirring of his pulses. There was but one tree on the  crag, and he stood against it. Almost mechanically his glance sought its  recesses, and his hand reached forward to something white. It was a  small handkerchief of cambric and lace. The other men were staring at  the scenery. He hastily glanced at the initials in the corner of the  scented trifle, and wondered that he should so easily decipher a tangled  E.C.C. But he marvelled, nevertheless, and thrust the handkerchief into  his pocket.    
They reached Poughkeepsie late in the afternoon. Main Street, which was  the interruption of the post road, and East Street, which terminated the  Dutchess turnpike, were gaily decorated with flags and greens, the  windows and pavements crowded with people whose faces reflected the  nervous excitement with which the whole country throbbed. The capital  for ten years, the original village had spread over the hills into a  rambling town of many avenues, straight and twisted, and there were  pretentious houses and a certain amount of business. Hamilton and his  party were stared at with deep curiosity, but not cheered, for the town  was almost wholly Clintonian. The Governor had his official residence on  the Dutchess turnpike, a short distance from town; and this was his  court. Nevertheless, it was proudly conscious of the dignity incumbent  upon it as the legislative centre of the State, and no matter what the  suspense or the issue, had no mind to make the violent demonstrations of  other towns. Nearly every town of the North, including Albany, had  burned Hamilton in effigy, albeit with battered noses, for he had his  followers everywhere; but here he was met with a refreshing coolness,  for which the others of his party, at least, were thankful.    
They went first to Van Kleek's tavern, on the Upper Landing Road, not  far from the Court-house, to secure the rooms they had engaged; but  finding an invitation awaiting them from Henry Livingston to make use of  his house during the Convention, repaired with unmixed satisfaction to  the large estate on the other side of the town. The host was absent, but  his cousin had been requested to do the honours to as many as he would  ask to share a peaceful retreat from the daily scene of strife.    
"And it has the advantage of an assured privacy," said Hamilton. "For  here we can hold conference nightly with no fear of eavesdropping.  Moreover, to get a bath at Van Kleek's is as easy as making love to  Clinton."    
General Schuyler joined them an hour later. He had been in town all day,  and had held several conferences with the depressed Federalists, who,  between a minority which made them almost ridiculous, and uncomfortable  lodgings, were deep in gloomy forebodings. As soon as they heard of  their Captain's arrival they swarmed down to the Livingston mansion.  Hamilton harangued them cheerfully in the drawing-room, drank with them,  in his host's excellent wine, to the success of their righteous cause;  and they retired, buoyant, confirmed in their almost idolatrous belief  in the man who was responsible for all the ideas they possessed.
