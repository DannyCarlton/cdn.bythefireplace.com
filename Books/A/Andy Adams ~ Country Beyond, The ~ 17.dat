  From the cabin McKay went first to the great rock that jutted from   the broken shoulder of Cragg's Ridge, and as they stood there  Peter  heard the strange something that was like a laugh, and yet  was not a  laugh, on his master's lips. But his scraggly face did  not look up.  There was an answering whimper in his throat. He had  been slow in  sensing the significance of the mysterious thing that  had changed his  old home since months ago. During the hours of  afternoon, and these  moonlit hours that followed, he tried to  understand. He knew this was  home. Yet the green grass was gone,  and a million trees had changed  into blackened stubs. The world  was no longer shut in by deep forests.  And Cragg's Ridge was naked  where he and Nada had romped in sunshine  and flowers, and out of  it all rose the mucky death-smell of the  flame-swept earth. These  things he understood, in his dog way. But  what he could not  understand clearly was why Nada was not in the  cabin, and why they  did not find her, even though the world was  changed. 
  He sat back on his haunches, and Jolly Roger heard again the   whimpering grief in his throat. It comforted the man to know that   Peter remembered, and he was not alone in his desolation. Gently  he  placed a soot-grimed hand on his comrade's head. 
  &quot;Peter, it was from this rock&#8212;right where we're standing now&#8212;   that I first saw her, a long time ago,&quot; he said, a bit of forced   cheer breaking through the huskiness of his voice. &quot;Remember the   little jackpine clump down there? You climbed up onto her lap, a   little know-nothing thing, and you pawed in her loose curls, and   growled so fiercely I could hear you. And when I made a noise, and   she looked up, I thought she was the most beautiful thing I had  ever  seen&#8212;just a kid, with those eyes like the flowers, and her  hair  shining in the sun, an' tear stains on her cheeks. Tear  stains,  Pied-Bot&#8212;because of that snake who's dead over there.  Remember how  you growled at me, Peter?&quot; 
  Peter wriggled an answer. 
  &quot;That was the beginning,&quot; said Jolly Roger, &quot;and this&#8212;looks like   the end. But&#8212;&quot; 
  He clenched his fists, and there was a sudden fierceness in the   grotesque movement of his shadow on the rock. 
  &quot;We're going to find her before that end comes,&quot; he added   defiantly. &quot;We're going to find her, Pied-Bot, even if it takes us  to  the settlements&#8212;right up into the face of the law.&quot; 
  He set out over the rocks, his boots making hollow sounds in the   deadness of the world about them. Again he followed where once had   been the trail that led to Mooney's shack, over on the wobbly line  of  rail that rambled for eighty miles into the wilderness from  Fort  William. The P. D. W. it was named&#8212;Port Arthur, Duluth  Western; but  it had never reached Duluth, and there were those who  had nicknamed it  Poverty, Destruction Want. Many times Jolly  Roger had laughed at the  queer stories Nada told him about it; how  a wrecking outfit was always  carried behind on the twice-a-week  train, and how the crew picked  berries in season, and had their  trapping lines, and once chased a  bear half way to Whitefish Lake  while the train waited for hours. She  called it the &quot;Cannon Ball,&quot;  because once upon a time it had made  sixty-nine miles in twenty-  four hours. But there was nothing of humor  about it as Jolly Roger  and Peter came out upon it tonight. It  stretched out both ways  from them, a thin, grim line of tragedy in the  moonlight, and from  where they stood it appeared to reach into a black  and abysmal  sea. 
  Once more man and dog paused, and looked back at what had been.   And the whine came in Peter's throat again and something tugged   inside him, urging him to bark up into the face of the moon, as he   had often barked for Nada in the days of his puppyhood, and   afterward. 
  But his master went on and Peter followed him, stepping the uneven   ties one by one. And with the black chaos of the world under and   about them, and the glorious light of the moon filling; the sky  over  their heads, the journey they made seemed weirdly unreal. For  the  silver and gold of the moon and the black muck of the fire  refused to  mingle, and while over their heads they could see the  tiniest clouds  and beyond to the farthest stars, all was black  emptiness when they  looked about them upon what once had been a  living earth. Only the two  lines of steel caught the moon-glow and  the charred ends of the  fire-shriven stubs that rose up out of the  earth shroud and  silhouetted themselves against the sky. 
  To Peter it was not what he failed to see, but what he did not   hear or smell that oppressed him and stirred him to wide-eyed   watchfulness against impending evil. Under many moons he had  traveled  with his master in their never-ending flight from the  law, and many  other nights with neither moon nor stars had they  felt out their  trails together. But always, under him and over him  on all sides of  him, there had been LIFE. And tonight there was no  life, nor smell of  life. There was no chirp of night bird, or  flutter of owl's wing, no  plash of duck or cry of loon. He  listened in vain for the crinkling  snap of twig, and the whisper  of wind in treetops. And there was no  smell&#8212;no musk of mink that  had crossed his path, no taste in the air  of the strong scented  fox, no subtle breath of partridge and rabbit  and fleshy  porcupine. And even from the far distances there came no  sound, no  howl of wolf, no castanet clatter of stout moose horns  against  bending saplings&#8212;not even the howl of a trapper's dog. 
  The stillness was of the earth, and yet unearthly. It was even as   if some fearsome thing was smothering the sound of his master's  feet.  To McKay, sensing these same things that Peter sensed, came   understanding that brought with it an uneasiness which changed   swiftly into the chill of a growing fear. The utter lifelessness  told  him how vast the destruction of the fire had been. Its  obliteration  was so great no life had adventured back into the  desolated country,  though the conflagration must have passed in  the preceding autumn,  many months ago. The burned country was a  grave and the nearest edge  of it, judged from the sepulchral  stillness of the night, was many  miles away. 
  For the first time came the horror of the thought that in such a   fire as this people must have died. It had swept upon them like a   tidal wave, galloping the forests with the speed of a race horse,   with only this thin line of rail leading to the freedom of life   outside. In places only a miracle could have made escape possible.   And here, where Nada had lived, with the pitch-wood forests  crowding  close, the fire must have burned most fiercely. In this  moment, when  fear of the unspeakable set his heart trembling, his  faith fastened  itself grimly to the little old gray Missioner,  Father John, in whose  cabin Nada had taken refuge many months ago,  when Jed Hawkins lay dead  in the trail with his one-eyed face  turned up to the thunder and  lightning in the sky. Father John, on  that stormy night when he fled  north, had promised to care for  Nada, and in silence he breathed a  prayer that the Missioner had  saved her from the red death that had  swept like an avalanche upon  them. He told himself it must be so. He  cried out the words aloud,  and Peter heard him, and followed closer,  so that his head touched  his master's leg as he walked. 
  But the fear was there. From a spark it grew into a red-hot spot   in Jolly Roger's heart. Twice in his own life he had raced against   death in a forest fire. But never had he seen a fire like this  must  have been. All at once he seemed to hear the roar of it in  his ears,  the rolling thunder of the earth as it twisted in the  cataclysm of  flame, the hissing shriek of the flaming pitch-tops  as they leapt in  lightning fires against the smoke-smothered sky.  A few hours ago he  had stood where Father John's Cabin had been  and the place was a ruin  of char and ash. If the fire had hemmed  them in and they had not  escaped&#8212; 
  His voice cried out in sudden protest. 
  &quot;It can't be, Peter. It can't be! They made the rail&#8212;or the lake   &#8212;and we'll find them in the settlements. It couldn't happen. God   wouldn't let her die like that!&quot; 
  He stopped, and stared into the moon-broken gloom on his left.   Something was there, fifty feet away, that drew him down through  the  muck which lay knee deep in the right-of-way ditch. It was  what was  left of the cutter's cabin, a clutter of burned logs, a  wind scattered  heap of ash. Even there, within arm's reach of the  railroad, there had  been no salvation from the fire. 
  He waded again through the muck of the ditch, and went on.   Mentally and physically he was fighting the ogre that was striving  to  achieve possession of his brain. Over and over he repeated his  faith  that Nada and the Missioner had escaped and he would find  them in the  settlements. Less than ever he thought of the law in  these hours. What  happened to himself was of small importance now,  if he could find Nada  alive before the menace caught up with him  from behind, or ambushed  him ahead. Yet the necessity of caution  impinged itself upon him even  in the recklessness of his  determination to find her if he had to walk  into the arms of the  law that was hunting him. 
  For an hour they went on, and as the moon sank westward it seemed   to turn its face to look at them; and behind them, when they  looked  back, the world was transformed into a black pit, while  ahead&#8212;with  the glow of it streaming over their shoulders&#8212;ghostly  shapes took  form, and vision reached farther. Twice they caught  the silvery gleam  of lakes through the tree-stubs, and again they  walked with the  rippling murmur of a stream that kept for a mile  within the sound of  their ears. But even here, with water crying  out its invitation to  life, there was no life. 
  Another hour after that Jolly Roger's pulse beat a little faster   as he strained his eyes to see ahead. Somewhere near, within a  mile  or two, was the first settlement with its sawmill and its  bunkhouses,  its one store and its few cabins, with flat mountains  of sawdust on  one side of it, and the evergreen forest creeping up  to its doors on  the other. Surely they would find life here, where  there had been man  power to hold fire back from the clearing. And  it was here he might  find Nada and the Missioner, for more than  once Father John had  preached to the red-cheeked women and  children and the clear-eyed men  of the Finnish community that  thrived there. 
  But as they drew nearer he listened in vain for the bark of a dog,   and his eyes quested as futilely for a point of light in the wide   canopy of gloom. At last, close together, they rounded a curve in  the  road, and crossed a small bridge with a creek running below,  and McKay  knew his arm should be able to send a stone to what he  was seeking  ahead. And then, a minute later, he drew in a great  gasping breath of  unbelief and horror. 
  For the settlement was no longer in the clearing between him and   the rim-glow of the moon. No living tree raised its head against  the  sky, no sign of cabin or mill shadowed the earth, and where  the store  had been, and the little church with its white-painted  cross, was only  a chaos of empty gloom. 
  He went down, as he had gone to the tie cutter's cabin, and for   many minutes he stared and listened, while Peter seemed to stand   without breathing. Then making a wide megaphone of his hands, he   shouted. It was an alarming thing to do and Peter started as if   struck. For there were only ghosts to answer back and the  hollowness  of a shriven pit for the cry to travel in. Nothing was  there. Even the  great sawdust piles had shrunk into black scars  under the scourge of  the fire. 
  A groaning agony was in the breath of Jolly Roger's lips as he   went back to the railroad and hurried on Death must have come  here,  death sudden and swift. And if it had fallen upon the  Finnish  settlement, with its strong women and its stronger men,  what might it  not have done in the cabin of the little old gray  Missioner&#8212;and Nada? 
  For a long time after that he forgot Peter was with him. He forgot   everything but his desire to reach a living thing. At times, where   the road-bed was smooth, he almost ran, and at others he paused  for a  little to gather his breath and listen. And it was Peter, in  one of  these intervals, who caught the first message of life. From  a long  distance away came faintly the barking of a dog. 
  Half a mile farther on they came to a clearing where no stubs of   trees stood up like question marks against the sky, and in this   clearing was a cabin, a dark blotch that was without light or  sound.  But from behind it the dog barked again, and Jolly Roger  made quickly  toward it. Here there was no ash under his feet, and  he knew that at  last he had found an oasis of life in the  desolation. Loudly he  knocked with his fist at the cabin door and  soon there was a response  inside, the heavy movement of a man's  body getting out of bed, and  after that the questioning voice of a  woman. He knocked again and the  flare of a lighted match illumined  the window. Then came the drawing  of a bar at the door and a man  stood there in his night attire, a man  with a heavy face and  bristling beard, and a lamp in his hand. 
  &quot;I beg your pardon for waking you,&quot; said Jolly Roger, &quot;but I am   just down from the north, hoping to find my friends back here and  I  have seen nothing but destruction and death. You are the first  living  soul I have found to ask about them.&quot; 
  &quot;Where were they?&quot; grunted the man. 
  &quot;At Cragg's Ridge.&quot; 
  &quot;Then God help them,&quot; came the woman's voice from back in the   room. 
  &quot;Cragg's Ridge,&quot; said the man, &quot;was a burning hell in the middle   of the night.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger's fingers dug into the wood at the edge of the door. 
  &quot;You mean&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;A lot of 'em died,&quot; said the man stolidly, as if eager to rid   himself of the one who had broken his sleep. &quot;If it was Mooney,  he's  dead. An' if it was Robson, or Jake the Swede, or the Adams   family&#8212;they're dead, too.&quot; 
  &quot;But it wasn't,&quot; said Jolly Roger, his heart choking between fear   and hope. &quot;It was Father John, the Missioner, and Nada Hawkins,  who  lived with him&#8212;or with her foster-mother in the Hawkins'  cabin.&quot; 
  The man shook his head, and turned down the wick of his lamp. 
  &quot;I dunno about the girl, or the old witch who was her mother,&quot; he   said, &quot;but the Missioner made it out safe, and went to the   settlements.&quot; 
  &quot;And no girl was with him?&quot; 
  &quot;No, there was no girl,&quot; came the woman's voice again, and Peter   jerked up his ears at the creaking of a bed. &quot;Father John stopped   here the second day after the fire had passed, and he said he was   gathering up the bones of the dead. Nada Hawkins wasn't with him,  and  he didn't say who had died and who hadn't. But I think&#8212;&quot; 
  She stopped as the bearded man turned toward her. 
  &quot;You think what?&quot; demanded Jolly Roger, stepping half into the   room. 
  &quot;I think,&quot; said the woman, &quot;that she died along with the others.   Anyway, Jed Hawkins' witch-woman was burned trying to make for the   lake, and little of her was left.&quot; 
  The man with the lamp made a movement as if to close the door. 
  &quot;That's all we know,&quot; he growled. 
  &quot;For God's sake&#8212;don't!&quot; entreated Jolly Roger, barring the door   with his arm. &quot;Surely there were some who escaped from Cragg's  Ridge  and beyond!&quot; 
  &quot;Mebby a half, mebby less,&quot; said the man. &quot;I tell you it burned   like hell, and the worst of it came in the middle of the night  with a  wind behind it that blew a hurricane. We've twenty acres  cleared here,  with the cabin in the center of it, an' it singed my  beard and burned  her hair and scorched our hands, and my pigs died  out there from the  heat of it. Mebby it's a place to sleep in for  the night you want,  stranger?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I'm going on,&quot; said Jolly Roger, the blood in his veins   running with the chill of water. &quot;How far before I come to the end  of  fire?&quot; 
  &quot;Ten miles on. It started this side of the next settlement.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger drew back and the door closed, and standing on the   railroad once more he saw the light go out and after that the   occasional barking of the settler's dog grew fainter and fainter   behind them. 
  He felt a great weariness in his bones and body now. With hope   struck down the exhaustion of two nights and a day without sleep   seized upon him and his feet plodded more and more slowly over the   uneven ties of the road. Even in his weariness he fought madly   against the thought that Nada was dead and he repeated the word   &quot;impossible&#8212;impossible&quot; so often that it ran in sing-song through   his brain. And he could not keep away from him the white, thin  face  of the Missioner, who had promised on his faith In God to  care for  Nada, and who had passed the settler's cabin ALONE. 
  Another two hours they went on and then came the first of the   green timber. Under the shelter of some balsams Jolly Roger found  a  resting place and there they waited for the break of dawn. Peter   stretched out and slept. But Jolly Roger sat with his head and   shoulders against the bole of a tree, and not until the light of  the  moon was driven away by the darkness that preceded dawn by an  hour or  two did his eyes close in restless slumber. He was roused  by the  wakening twitter of birds and in the cold water of a creek  that ran  near he bathed his face and hands. Peter wondered why  there was no  fire and no breakfast this morning. 
  The settlement was only a little way ahead and it was very early   when they reached it. People were still in their beds and out of  only  one chimney was smoke rising into the clear calm of the  breaking day.  From this cabin a young man came, and stood for a  moment after he had  closed the door, yawning and stretching his  arms and looking up to see  what sort of promise the sky held for  the day. After that he went to a  stable of logs, and Jolly Roger  followed him there. 
  He was unlike the bearded settler, and nodded with a youthful   smile of cheer. 
  &quot;Good morning,&quot; he said. &quot;You're traveling early, and&#8212;&quot; 
  He looked more keenly as his eyes took in Jolly Roger's boots and   clothes, and the gray pallor in his face. 
  &quot;Just get in?&quot; he asked kindly. &quot;And&#8212;from the burnt country?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, from the burnt country. I've been away a long time, and I'm   trying to find out if my friends are among the living or the dead.   Did you ever hear of Father John, the Missioner at Cragg's Ridge?&quot; 
  The young man's face brightened. 
  &quot;I knew him,&quot; he said. &quot;He helped me to bury my brother, three   years ago. And if it's him you seek, he is safe. He went up to  Fort  William a week after the fire, and that was in September,  eight months  past.&quot; 
  &quot;And was there with him a girl named Nada Hawkins?&quot; asked Jolly   Roger, trying hard to speak calmly as he looked into the other's   face. 
  The youth shook his head. 
  &quot;No, he was alone. He slept in my cabin overnight, and he said   nothing of a girl named Nada Hawkins.&quot; 
  &quot;Did he speak of others?&quot; 
  &quot;He was very tired, and I think he was half dead with grief at   what had happened. He spoke no names that I remember.&quot; 
  Then he saw the gray look in Jolly Roger's face grow deeper, and   saw the despair which could not hide itself in his eyes. 
  &quot;But there were a number of girls who passed here, alone or with   their friends,&quot; he said hopefully. &quot;What sort of looking girl was   Nada Hawkins?&quot; 
  &quot;A&#8212;kid. That's what I called her,&quot; said Jolly Roger, in a dead,   cold voice. &quot;Eighteen, and beautiful, with blue eyes, and brown  hair  that she couldn't keep from blowing in curls about her face.  So like  an angel you wouldn't forget her if you'd seen her&#8212;just  once.&quot; 
  Gently the youth placed a hand on Jolly Roger's arm. 
  &quot;She didn't come this way,&quot; he said, &quot;but maybe you'll find her   somewhere else. Won't you have breakfast with me? I've a stranger  in  the cabin, still sleeping, who's going into the fire country  from  which you've come. He's hunting for some one, and maybe you  can give  him information. He's going to Cragg's Ridge.&quot; 
  &quot;Cragg's Ridge!&quot; exclaimed Jolly Roger. &quot;What is his name?&quot; 
  &quot;Breault,&quot; said the youth. &quot;Sergeant Breault, of the Royal   Northwest Mounted Police.&quot; 
  Jolly Roger turned to stroke the neck of a horse waiting for its   morning feed. But he felt nothing of the touch of flesh under his   hand. Cold as iron went his heart, and for half a minute he made  no  answer. Then he said: 
  &quot;Thanks, friend. I breakfasted before it was light and I'm hitting   out into the brush west and north, for the Rainy River country.   Please don't tell this man Breault that you saw me, for he'll  think  badly of me for not waiting to give him information he might  want.  But&#8212;you understand&#8212;if you loved the brother who died&#8212;that  it's hard  for me to talk with anyone just now.&quot; 
  The young man's fingers touched his arm again. 
  &quot;I understand,&quot; he said, &quot;and I hope to God you'll find her.&quot; 
  Silently they shook hands, and Jolly Roger hurried away from the   cabin with the rising spiral of smoke. 
  Three days later a man and a dog came from the burned country into   the town of Fort William, seeking for a wandering messenger of God   who called himself Father John, and a young and beautiful girl  whose  name was Nada Hawkins. He stopped first at the old mission,  in whose  shadow the Indians and traders of a century before had  bartered their  wares, and Father Augustine, the aged patriarch who  talked with him,  murmured as he went that he was a strange man,  and a sick one, with a  little madness lurking in his eyes. 
  And it was, in fact, a madness of despair eating out the life in   Jolly Roger's heart. For he no longer had hope Nada had escaped  the  fire, even though at no place had he found a conclusive  evidence of  her death. But that signified little, for there were  many of the  missing who had not been found between the last of  September and these  days of May. What he did find, with deadly  regularity, was the fact  that Father John had escaped&#8212;and that he  had traveled to safety  ALONE. 
  And Father Augustine told him that when Father John stopped to   rest for a few days at the Mission he was heading north, for   somewhere on Pashkokogon Lake near the river Albany. 
  There was little rest for Peter and his master at Fort William   town. That Breault must be close on their trail, and following it   with the merciless determination of the ferret from which he had  been  named, there was no shadow of doubt in the mind of Jolly  Roger McKay.  So after outfitting his pack at a little corner shop,  where Breault  would be slow to enquire about him, he struck north  through the bush  toward Dog Lake and the river of the same name.  Five or six days, he  thought, would bring him to Father John and  the truth which he dreaded  more and more to hear. 
  The despondency of his master had sunk, in some mysterious way,   into the soul of Peter. Without the understanding of language he   sensed the oppressive gloom of tragedy behind and about him and  there  was a wolfish slinking in the manner of his travel now, and  his  confidence was going as he caught the disease of despair of  the man  who traveled with him. But constantly and vigilantly his  eyes and  scent were questing about them, suspicious of the very  winds that  whispered in the treetops. And at night after they had  built their  little cooking fire in the deepest heart of the bush  he would lie half  awake during the hours of darkness, the  watchfulness of his senses  never completely dulled in the stupor  of sleep. 
  Since the night they had stopped at the settler's cabin Jolly   Roger's face had grown grayer and thinner. A number of times he  had  tried to assure himself what he would do in that moment which  was  coming when he would stand face to face with Breault the man-  hunter.  His caution, after he left Fort William, was in a way an  automatic  instinct that worked for self-preservation in face of  the fact that he  was growing less and less concerned regarding  Breault's appearance. It  was not in his desire to delay the end  much longer. The chase had been  a long one, with its thrills and  its happiness at times, but now he  was growing tired and with Nada  gone there was only hopeless gloom  ahead. If she were dead he  wanted to go to her. That thought was a  dawning pleasure in his  breast, and it was warm in his heart when he  tied in a hard knot  the buckskin string which locked the flap of his  pistol holster.  When Breault overtook him the law would know, because  of the  significance of this knot, that he had welcomed the end of the   game. 
  Never in the northland had there come a spring more beautiful than   this of the year in which McKay and his dog went through the deep   wilds to Pashkokogon Lake. In a few hours, it seemed, the last  chill  died out of the air and there came the soft whispers of  those  bridal-weeks between May and Summer, a month ahead of their  time. But  Jolly Roger, for the first time in his life, failed to  respond to the  wonder and beauty of the earth's rejoicing. The  first flowers did not  fill him with the old joy. He no longer  stood up straight, with  expanding chest, to drink in the rare  sweetness of air weighted with  the tonic of balsams and cedar  spruce. Vainly he tried to lift up his  soul with the song and  bustle of mating things. There was no longer  music for him in the  flood-time rushing of spring waters. An utter  loneliness filled  the cry of the loon. And all about him was a vast  emptiness from  which the spirit of life had fled for him. 
  Thus he came at last to a stream in the Burntwood country which   ran into Pashkokogon Lake; and it was this day, in the mellow   sunlight of late afternoon, that they heard coming to them from  out  of the dense forest the chopping of an axe. 
  Toward this they made their way, with caution and no sound, until   in a little clearing in a bend of the stream they saw a cabin. It  was  a newly built cabin, and smoke was rising from the chimney. 
  But the chopping was nearer them, in the heart of a thick cover of   evergreen and birch. Into this Jolly Roger and Peter made their  way  and came within a dozen steps of the man who was wielding the  axe. It  was then that Jolly Roger rose up with a cry on his lips,  for the man  was Father John the Missioner. 
  In spite of the tragedy through which he had passed the little   gray man seemed younger than in that month long ago when Jolly  Roger  had fled to the north. He dropped his axe now and stood as  if only  half believing, a look of joy shining in his face as he  realized the  truth of what had happened. &quot;McKay,&quot; he cried,  reaching out his hands.  &quot;McKay, my boy!&quot; 
  A look of pity mellowed the gladness in his eyes as he noted the   change in Jolly Roger's face, and the despair that had set its  mark  upon it. 
  They stood for a moment with clasped hands, questioning and   answering with the silence of their eyes. And then the Missioner   said: 
  &quot;You have heard? Someone has told you?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Jolly Roger, his head dropping a little. &quot;No one has   told me,&quot; and he was thinking of Nada, and her death. 
  Father John's fingers tightened. 
  &quot;It is strange how the ways of God bring themselves about,&quot; he   spoke in a low voice. &quot;Roger, you did not kill Jed Hawkins!&quot; 
  Dumbly, his lips dried of words, Jolly Roger stared at him. 
  &quot;No, you didn't kill him,&quot; repeated Father John. &quot;On that same   night of the storm when you thought you left him dead in the  trail,  he stumbled back to his cabin, alive. But God's vengeance  came soon. 
  &quot;A few days later, while drunk, he missed his footing and fell   from a ledge to his death. His wife, poor creature, wished him  buried  in sight of the cabin door&#8212;&quot; 
  But in this moment Roger McKay was thinking less of Breault the   Ferret and the loosening of the hangman's rope from about his neck   than he was of another thing. And Father John was saying in a  voice  that seemed far away and unreal: 
  &quot;We've sent out word to all parts of the north, hoping someone   would find you and send you back. And she has prayed each night,  and  each hour of the day the same prayer has been in her heart and  on her  lips. And now&#8212;&quot; 
  Someone was coming to them from the direction of the cabin&#8212;   someone, a girl, and she was singing, 
  McKay's face went whiter than the gray ash of fire. 
  &quot;My God,&quot; he whispered huskily. &quot;I thought&#8212;she had died!&quot; 
  It was only then Father John understood the meaning of what he had   seen in his face. 
  &quot;No, she is alive,&quot; he cried. &quot;I sent her straight north through   the bush with an Indian the day after the fire. And later I left  word  for you with the Fire Relief Committee at Fort Wiliam, where  I thought  you would first enquire.&quot; 
  &quot;And it was there,&quot; said Jolly Roger, &quot;that I did not enquire at   all!&quot; 
  In the edge of the clearing, close to the thicket of timber, Nada   had stopped. For across the open space a strange looking creature  had  raced at the sound of her voice; a dog with bristling Airedale   whiskers, and a hound's legs, and wild-wolf's body hardened and   roughened by months of fighting in the wilderness. As in the days  of  his puppyhood, Peter leapt up against her, and a cry burst from  Nada's  lips, a wild and sobbing cry of PETER, PETER, PETER&#8212;and it  was this  cry Jolly Roger heard as he tore away from Father John. 
  On her knees, with her arms about Peter's shaggy head, Nada stared   wildly at the clump of timber, and in a moment she saw a man break   out of it, and stand still, as if the mellow sunlight blinded him,   and made him unable to move. And the same choking weakness was at  her  own heart as she rose up from Peter, and reached out her arms  toward  the gray figure in the edge of the wood, sobbing, trying to  speak and  yet saying no word. 
  And a little slower, because of his age, Father John came a moment   later, and peered out with the knowledge of long years from a  thicket  of young banksians, and when he saw the two in the open,  close in each  other's arms, and Peter hopping madly about them, he  drew out a  handkerchief and wiped his eyes, and went back then for  the axe which  he had dropped in the timber clump. 
  There was a great drumming in Jolly Roger's head, and for a time   he failed even to hear Peter yelping at their side, for all the  world  was drowned in those moments by the breaking sobs in Nada's  breath and  the wild thrill of her body in his arms; and he saw  nothing but the  upturned face, crushed close against his breast,  and the wide-open  eyes, and the lips to kiss. And even Nada's face  he seemed to see  through a silvery mist, and he felt her arms  strangely about his neck,  as if it was all half like a dream&#8212;a  dream of the kind that had come  to him beside his campfire. It was  a little cry from Nada that drove  the unreality away. 
  &quot;Roger&#8212;you're&#8212;breaking me,&quot; she cried, gasping for her breath in   his arms, yet without giving up the clasp of her own arms about  his  neck in the least; and at that he sensed the brutality of his   strength, and held her off a little, looking into her face. 
  Pride and happiness and the courage in his heart would have slunk   away could he have seen himself then, as Father John saw him,  coming  from the edge of the bush, and as Nada saw him, held there  at the end  of his arms. Since the day he had come with Peter to  Cragg's Ridge the  blade of a razor had not touched his face, and  his beard was like a  brush, and with it his hair unkempt and  straggling; and his eyes were  red from sleeplessness and the  haunting of that grim despair which had  dogged his footsteps. 
  But these things Nada did not see. Or, if she did, there must have   been something beautiful about them for her. For it was not a  little  girl, but a woman who was standing there before Jolly Roger  now&#8212;Nada  grown older, very much older it seemed to McKay, and  taller, with her  hair no longer rioting free about her, but  gathered up in a wonderful  way on the crown of her head. This  change McKay discovered as she  stood there, and it swept upon him  all in a moment, and with it the  prick of something swift and  terrorizing inside him. She was not the  little girl of Cragg's  Ridge. She was a WOMAN. In a year had come this  miracle of change,  and it frightened him, for such a creature as this  that stood  before him now Jed Hawkins would never have dared to curse  or  beat, and he&#8212;Roger McKay&#8212;was afraid to gather her back into his   arms again. 
  And then, even as his fingers slowly drew themselves away from her   shoulders, he saw that which had not changed&#8212;the wonder-light in  her  eyes, the soul that lay as open to him now as on that other  day in  Indian Tom's cabin, when Mrs. Captain Kidd had bustled and  squeaked on  the pantry shelf, and Peter had watched them as he lay  with his broken  leg in the going down of the sun. And as he  hesitated it was Nada  herself who came into his arms, and laid her  head on his breast, and  trembled and laughed and cried there,  while Father John came up and  patted her shoulder, and smiled  happily at McKay, and then went on to  the cabin in the clearing.  For a time after that Jolly Roger crushed  his face in Nada's hair,  and neither said a word, but there was a  strange throbbing of  their hearts together, and after a little Nada  reached up a hand  to his cheek, and stroked it tenderly, bristly beard  and all. 
  &quot;I'll never let you run away from me again&#8212;Mister&#8212;Jolly Roger,&quot;   she said, and it was the little Nada of Cragg's Ridge who  whispered  the words, half sobbing; but in the voice there was also  something  very definite and very sure, and McKay felt the glorious  thrill of it  as he raised his face from her hair, and saw once  more the sun-filled  world about him.
