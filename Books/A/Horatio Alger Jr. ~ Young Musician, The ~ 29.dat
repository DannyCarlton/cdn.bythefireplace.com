    Philip was still a boy, and though he had discovered that the   professor was something of a humbug, and a good deal of a braggart,   it had not for a moment occurred to him that he would prove   dishonest. Even now he did not want to believe it, though he was   nervously apprehensive that it might prove true. 
  &quot;I will take my breakfast,&quot; he said, as coolly as was possible,  &quot;and  the professor will probably join me before I am through.&quot; 
  The clerk and the landlord thought otherwise. They were pretty well   convinced that Riccabocca was dishonest, and quietly sent for those   to whom the &quot;combination&quot; was indebted: namely, the printer and   publisher of the Daily Bulletin, the agent of the music-hall, and  the  bill-sticker who had posted notices of the entertainment. These   parties arrived while Philip was at breakfast. 
  &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said the landlord, &quot;the boy is at breakfast. I think  he  is all right, but I don't know. The professor, I fear, is a   swindle.&quot; 
  &quot;The boy is liable for our debts,&quot; said the agent. &quot;He belongs to   the combination.&quot; 
  &quot;I am afraid he is a victim as well as you,&quot; said the landlord. &quot;He   seemed surprised to hear that the professor had gone out.&quot; 
  &quot;It may all be put on. Perhaps he is in the plot, and is to meet  the  old fraud at some place fixed upon, and divide the booty,&quot;  suggested  the agent. 
  &quot;The boy looks honest,&quot; said the landlord. &quot;I like his appearance.   We will see what he has to say.&quot; 
  So when Philip had finished his breakfast he was summoned to the   parlor, where he met the creditors of the combination. 
  &quot;These gentlemen,&quot; said the landlord, &quot;have bills against you and   the professor. It makes no difference whether they receive pay from   you or him.&quot; 
  Poor Philip's heart sank within him. 
  &quot;I was hoping Professor Riccabocca had settled your bills,&quot; he  said.  &quot;Please show them to me.&quot; 
  This was done with alacrity. 
  Philip found that they owed five dollars for the hall, five dollars   for advertising and printing, and one dollar for bill-posting&#8212;   eleven dollars in all. 
  &quot;Mr. Gates,&quot; said our hero uneasily, to the landlord, &quot;did  Professor  Riccabocca say anything about coming back when he went out  this  morning?&quot; 
  &quot;He told my clerk he would be back to breakfast,&quot; said the  landlord;  adding, with a shrug of the shoulders: &quot;That was two hours  and a  half ago. He can't be very hungry.&quot; 
  &quot;He didn't pay his bill, I suppose?&quot; 
  &quot;No, of course not. He had not given up his room.&quot; 
  Philip became more and more uneasy. 
  &quot;Didn't you know anything about his going out?&quot; asked the landlord. 
  &quot;No, sir. I was fast asleep.&quot; 
  &quot;Is the professor in the habit of taking long morning walks?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know.&quot; 
  &quot;That is strange, since you travel together,&quot; remarked the   publisher. 
  &quot;I never saw him till day before yesterday,&quot; said Philip. 
  The creditors looked at each other significantly. They began to   suspect that Philip also was a victim. 
  &quot;Do you know how much money was received for tickets last evening?&quot; 
  &quot;About a hundred and fifty dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;How much of this were you to receive?&quot; 
  &quot;Half of what was left after the bills were paid.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you received it?&quot; asked the agent. 
  &quot;Not a cent,&quot; answered Philip. 
  &quot;What do you think about the situation?&quot; 
  &quot;I think that Professor Riccabocca has swindled us all,&quot; answered   Philip promptly. 
  &quot;Our bills ought to be paid,&quot; said the agent, who was rather a hard   man in his dealings. 
  &quot;I agree with you,&quot; said Philip. &quot;I wish I were able to pay them,   but I have only six dollars in my possession.&quot; 
  &quot;That will pay me, and leave a dollar over,&quot; suggested the agent. 
  &quot;If it comes to that,&quot; said the printer, &quot;I claim that I ought to  be  paid first.&quot; 
  &quot;I am a poor man,&quot; said the bill-sticker. &quot;I need my money.&quot; 
  Poor Philip was very much disconcerted. It was a new thing for him   to owe money which he could not repay. 
  &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;I have myself been cheated out of fifty   dollars, at least&#8212;my share of the profits. I wish I could pay you   all. I cannot do so now. Whenever I can I will certainly do it.&quot; 
  &quot;You can pay us a part with the money you have,&quot; said the agent. 
  &quot;I owe Mr. Gates for nearly two days' board,&quot; he said. &quot;That is my   own affair, and I must pay him first.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see why he should be preferred to me,&quot; grumbled the agent;   then, with a sudden, happy thought, as he termed it, he said: &quot;I  will  tell you how you can pay us all.&quot; 
  &quot;How?&quot; asked Philip. 
  &quot;You have a violin. You can sell that for enough to pay our bills.&quot; 
  Poor Philip! His violin was his dependence. Besides the natural   attachment he felt for it, he relied upon it to secure him a living,   and the thought of parting with it was bitter. 
  &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he said, &quot;if you take my violin, I have no way of   making a living. If you will consider that I, too, am a victim of   this man, I think you will not wish to inflict such an injury upon   me.&quot; 
  &quot;I do not, for one,&quot; said the publisher. &quot;I am not a rich man, and  I  need all the money that is due me, but I wouldn't deprive the boy of   his violin.&quot; 
  &quot;Nor I,&quot; said the bill-sticker. 
  &quot;That's all very fine,&quot; said the agent; &quot;but I am not so soft as  you  two. Who knows but the boy is in league with the professor?&quot; 
  &quot;I know it!&quot; said the landlord stoutly. &quot;The boy is all right, or I   am no judge of human nature.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, Mr. Gates,&quot; said Philip, extending his hand to his   generous defender. 
  &quot;Do you expect we will let you off without paying anything?&quot;   demanded the agent harshly. 
  &quot;If I live, sir, you shall lose nothing by me,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;That won't do!&quot; said the man coarsely. &quot;I insist upon the fiddle   being sold. I'll give five dollars for it, and call it square.&quot; 
  &quot;Mr. Gunn,&quot; said the landlord, in a tone of disgust, &quot;since you are   disposed to persecute this boy, I will myself pay your bill, and   trust to him to repay me when he can.&quot; 
  &quot;But, Mr. Gates&#8212;&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;I accept!&quot; said the agent, with alacrity. 
  &quot;Receipt your bill,&quot; said the landlord. 
  Mr. Gunn did so, and received a five-dollar bill in return. 
  &quot;Now sir,&quot; said the landlord coldly, &quot;if you have no further   business here, we can dispense with your company.&quot; 
  &quot;It strikes me you are rather hard on a man because he wants to be   paid his honest dues!&quot; whined Gunn, rather uncomfortably. 
  &quot;We understand you, sir,&quot; said the landlord. &quot;We have not forgotten   how you turned a poor family into the street, in the dead of winter,   because they could not pay their rent.&quot; 
  &quot;Could I afford to give them house-room?&quot; inquired Gunn. 
  &quot;Perhaps not. At any rate, I don't feel inclined to give you   house-room any longer.&quot; 
  Mr. Gunn slunk out of the room, under the impression that his   company was no longer desired. 
  &quot;Mr. Gray,&quot; said the publisher, &quot;I hope you don't class me with the   man who has just gone out. I would sooner never be paid than deprive   you of your violin. Let the account stand, and if you are ever able   to pay me half of my bill&#8212;your share&#8212;I shall be glad to receive   it.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir!&quot; said Philip, &quot;You shall not repent your  confidence  in me.&quot; 
  &quot;I say ditto to my friend, the publisher,&quot; said the bill-poster. 
  &quot;Wait a moment, gentlemen,&quot; said Philip. &quot;There is a bare   possibility that I can do something for you.&quot; 
  For the first time since he left Norton he thought of the letter   which he was not to open till he was fifty miles from Norton. 
  &quot;Mr. Gates,&quot; he said, &quot;can you tell me how far Norton is from  here?&quot; 
  &quot;About sixty miles,&quot; answered the landlord in surprise. 
  &quot;Then it's all right.&quot;
