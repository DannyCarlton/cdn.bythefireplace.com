  The first night after leaving Iskwao and Pipoonaskoos the big  grizzly and the tan-faced cub wandered without sleep under the  brilliant stars. Thor did not hunt for meat. He climbed a steep slope,  then went down the shale side of a dip, and in a small basin hidden at  the foot of a mountain came to a soft green meadow where the dog-tooth  violet, with its slender stem, its two lily-like leaves, its single  cluster of five-petalled flowers, and its luscious, bulbous root grew  in great profusion. And here all through the night he dug and ate.
  Muskwa, who had filled himself on spring beauty roots, was not  hungry, and as the day had been a restful one for him, outside of his  fighting, he found this night filled with its brilliant stars quite  enjoyable. The moon came up about ten o'clock, and it was the biggest,  and the reddest, and the most beautiful moon Muskwa had seen in his  short life. It rolled up over the peaks like a forest fire, and filled  all the Rocky Mountains with a wonderful glow. The basin, in which  there were perhaps ten acres of meadow, was lighted up almost like day.  The little lake at the foot of the mountain glimmered softly, and the  tiny stream that fed it from the melting snows a thousand feet above  shot down in glistening cascades that caught the moonlight like  rivulets of dull polished diamonds.
  About the meadow were scattered little clumps of bushes and a few  balsams and spruce, as if set there for ornamental purposes; and on one  side there was a narrow, verdure-covered slide that sloped upward for a  third of a mile, and at the top of which, unseen by Muskwa and Thor, a  band of sheep were sleeping.
  Muskwa wandered about, always near Thor, investigating the clumps of  bushes, the dark shadows of the balsams and spruce, and the edge of the  lake. Here he found a plashet of soft mud which was a great solace to  his sore feet. Twenty times during the night he waded in the mud.
  Even when the dawn came Thor seemed to be in no great haste to leave  the basin. Until the sun was well up he continued to wander about the  meadow and the edge of the lake, digging up occasional roots, and  eating tender grass. This did not displease Muskwa, who made his  breakfast of the dog-tooth violet bulbs. The one matter that puzzled  him was why Thor did not go into the lake and throw out trout, for he  yet had to learn that all water did not contain fish. At last he went  fishing for himself, and succeeded in getting a black hard-shelled  water beetle that nipped his nose with a pair of needle-like pincers  and brought a yelp from him.
  It was perhaps ten o'clock, and the sun-filled basin was like a warm  oven to a thick-coated bear, when Thor searched up among the rocks near  the waterfall until he found a place that was as cool as an  old-fashioned cellar. It was a miniature cavern. All about it the slate  and sandstone was of a dark and clammy wet from a hundred little  trickles of snow water that ran down from the peaks.
  It was just the sort of a place Thor loved on a July day, but to  Muskwa it was dark and gloomy and not a thousandth part as pleasant as  the sun. So after an hour or two he left Thor in his frigidarium and  began to investigate the treacherous ledges.
  For a few minutes all went well&#8212;then he stepped on a green-tinted  slope of slate over which a very shallow dribble of water was running.  The water had been running over it in just that way for some centuries,  and the shelving slate was worn as smooth as the surface of a polished  pearl, and it was as slippery as a greased pole. Muskwa's feet went out  from under him so quickly that he hardly knew what had happened. The  next moment he was on his way to the lake a hundred feet below. He  rolled over and over. He plashed into shallow pools. He bounced over  miniature waterfalls like a rubber ball. The wind was knocked out of  him. He was blinded and dazed by water and shock, and he gathered fresh  speed with every yard he made. He had succeeded in letting out half a  dozen terrified yelps at the start, and these roused Thor.
  Where the water from the peaks fell into the lake there was a  precipitous drop of ten feet, and over this Muskwa shot with a momentum  that carried him twice as far out into the pond. He hit with a big  splash, and disappeared. Down and down he went, where everything was  black and cold and suffocating; then the life-preserver with which  nature had endowed him in the form of his fat brought him to the  surface. He began to paddle with all four feet. It was his first swim,  and when he finally dragged himself ashore he was limp and exhausted.
  While he still lay panting and very much frightened, Thor came down  from the rocks. Muskwa's mother had given him a sound cuffing when he  got the porcupine quill in his foot. She had cuffed him for every  accident he had had, because she believed that cuffing was good  medicine. Education is largely cuffed into a bear cub, and she would  have given him a fine cuffing now. But Thor only smelled of him, saw  that he was all right, and began to dig up a dog-tooth violet.
  He had not finished the violet when suddenly he stopped. For a  half-minute he stood like a statue. Muskwa jumped and shook himself.  Then he listened. A sound came to both of them. In one slow, graceful  movement the grizzly reared himself to his full height. He faced the  north, his ears thrust forward, the sensitive muscles of his nostrils  twitching. He could smell nothing, but he<I> heard</I>!
  Over the slopes which they had climbed there had come to him faintly  a sound that was new to him, a sound that had never before been a part  of his life. It was the barking of dogs.
  For two minutes Thor sat on his haunches without moving a muscle of  his great body except those twitching thews in his nose.
  Deep down in this cup under the mountain it was difficult even for  sound to reach him. Quickly he swung down on all fours and made for the  green slope to the southward, at the top of which the band of sheep had  slept during the preceding night. Muskwa hurried after.
  A hundred yards up the slope Thor stopped and turned. Again he  reared himself. Now Muskwa also faced to the north. A sudden downward  drift of the wind brought the barking of the dogs to them clearly.
  Less than half a mile away Langdon's pack of trained Airedales were  hot on the scent. Their baying was filled with the fierce excitement  which told Bruce and Langdon, a quarter of a mile behind them, that  they were close upon their prey.
  And even more than it thrilled them did the tongueing of the dogs  thrill Thor. Again it was instinct that told him a new enemy had come  into his world. He was not afraid. But that instinct urged him to  retreat, and he went higher until he came to a part of the mountain  that was rough and broken, where once more he halted.
  This time he waited. Whatever the menace was it was drawing nearer  with the swiftness of the wind. He could hear it coming up the slope  that sheltered the basin from the valley.
  The crest of that slope was just about on a level with Thor's eyes,  and as he looked the leader of the pack came up over the edge of it and  stood for a moment outlined against the sky. The others followed  quickly, and for perhaps thirty seconds they stood rigid on the cap of  the hill, looking down into the basin at their feet and sniffing the  heavy scent with which it was filled.
  During those thirty seconds Thor watched his enemies without moving,  while in his deep chest there gathered slowly a low and terrible growl.  Not until the pack swept down into the cup of the mountain, giving full  tongue again, did he continue his retreat. But it was not flight. He  was not afraid. He was going on&#8212;because to go on was his business. He  was not seeking trouble; he had no desire even to defend his possession  of the meadow and the little lake under the mountain. There were other  meadows and other lakes, and he was not naturally a lover of fighting.  But he was ready to fight.
  He continued to rumble ominously, and in him there was burning a  slow and sullen anger. He buried himself among the rocks; he followed a  ledge with Muskwa slinking close at his heels; he climbed over a huge  scarp of rock, and twisted among boulders half as big as houses. But  not once did he go where Muskwa could not easily follow. Once, when he  drew himself from a ledge to a projecting seam of sandstone higher up,  and found that Muskwa could not climb it, he came down and went another  way.
  The baying of the dogs was now deep down in the basin. Then it began  to rise swiftly, as if on wings, and Thor knew that the pack was coming  up the green slide. He stopped again, and this time the wind brought  their scent to him full and strong.
  It was a scent that tightened every muscle in his great body and set  strange fires burning in him like raging furnaces. With the dogs came  also the<I> man-smell</I>!
  He travelled upward a little faster now, and the fierce and joyous  yelping of the dogs seemed scarcely a hundred yards away when he  entered a small open space in the wild upheaval of rock. On the  mountainside was a wall that rose perpendicularly. Twenty feet on the  other side was a sheer fall of a hundred feet, and the way ahead was  closed with the exception of a trail scarcely wider than Thor's body by  a huge crag of rock that had fallen from the shoulder of the mountain.  The big grizzly led Muskwa close up to this crag and the break that  opened through it, and then turned suddenly back, so that Muskwa was  behind him. In the face of the peril that was almost upon them a  mother-bear would have driven Muskwa into the safety of a crevice in  the rock wall. Thor did not do this. He fronted the danger that was  coming, and reared himself up on his hind quarters.
  Twenty feet away the trail he had followed swung sharply around a  projecting bulge in the perpendicular wall, and with eyes that were now  red and terrible Thor watched the trap he had set.
  The pack was coming full tongue. Fifty yards beyond the bulge the  dogs were running shoulder to shoulder, and a moment later the first of  them rushed into the arena which Thor had chosen for himself. The bulk  of the horde followed so closely that the first dogs were flung under  him as they strove frantically to stop themselves in time.
  With a roar Thor launched himself among them. His great right arm  swept out and inward, and it seemed to Muskwa that he had gathered a  half of the pack under his huge body. With a single crunch of his jaws  he broke the back of the foremost hunter. From a second he tore the  head so that the windpipe trailed out like a red rope.
  He rolled himself forward, and before the remaining dogs could  recover from their panic he had caught one a blow that sent him flying  over the edge of the precipice to the rocks a hundred feet below. It  had all happened in half a minute, and in that half-minute the  remaining nine dogs had scattered.
  But Langdon's Airedales were fighters. To the last dog they had come  of fighting stock, and Bruce and Metoosin had trained them until they  could be hung up by their ears without whimpering. The tragic fate of  three of their number frightened them no more than their own pursuit  had frightened Thor.
  Swift as lightning they circled about the grizzly, spreading  themselves on their forefeet, ready to spring aside or backward to  avoid sudden rushes, and giving voice now to that quick, fierce yapping  which tells hunters their quarry is at bay. This was their business&#8212;to  harass and torment, to retard flight, to stop their prey again and  again until their masters came to finish the kill. It was a quite fair  and thrilling sport for the bear and the dogs. The man who comes up  with the rifle ends it in murder.
  But if the dogs had their tricks, Thor also had his. After three or  four vain rushes, in which the Airedales eluded him by their superior  quickness, he backed slowly toward the huge rock beside which Muskwa  was crouching, and as he retreated the dogs advanced.
  Their increased barking and Thor's evident inability to drive them  away or tear them to pieces terrified Muskwa more than ever. Suddenly  he turned tail and darted into a crevice in the rock behind him.
  Thor continued to back until his great hips touched the stone. Then  he swung his head side wise and looked for the cub. Not a hair of  Muskwa was to be seen. Twice Thor turned his head. After that, seeing  that Muskwa was gone, he continued to retreat until he blocked the  narrow passage that was his back door to safety.
  The dogs were now barking like mad. They were drooling at their  mouths, their wiry crests stood up like brushes, and their snarling  fangs were bared to their red gums.
  Nearer and nearer they came to him, challenging him to stay, to rush  them, to catch them if he could&#8212;and in their excitement they put ten  yards of open space behind them. Thor measured this space, as he had  measured the distance between him and the young bull caribou a few days  before. And then, without so much as a snarl of warning, he darted out  upon his enemies with a suddenness that sent them flying wildly for  their lives.
  Thor did not stop. He kept on. Where the rock wall bulged out the  trail narrowed to five feet, and he had measured this fact as well as  the distance. He caught the last dog, and drove it down under his paw.  As it was torn to pieces the Airedale emitted piercing cries of agony  that reached Bruce and Langdon as they hurried panting and wind-broken  up the slide that led from the basin.
  Thor dropped on his belly in the narrowed trail, and as the pack  broke loose with fresh voice he continued to tear at his victim until  the rock was smeared with blood and hair and entrails. Then he rose to  his feet and looked again for Muskwa. The cub was curled up in a  shivering ball two feet in the crevice. It may be that Thor thought he  had gone on up the mountain, for he lost no time now in retreating from  the scene of battle. He had caught the wind again. Bruce and Langdon  were sweating, and their smell came to him strongly.
  For ten minutes Thor paid no attention to the eight dogs yapping at  his heels, except to pause now and then and swing his head about. As he  continued in his retreat the Airedales became bolder, until finally one  of them sprang ahead of the rest and buried his fangs in the grizzly's  leg.
  This accomplished what barking had failed to do. With another roar  Thor turned and pursued the pack headlong for fifty yards over the  back-trail, and five precious minutes were lost before he continued  upward toward the shoulder of the mountain.
  Had the wind been in another direction the pack would have  triumphed, but each time that Langdon and Bruce gained ground the wind  warned Thor by bringing to him the warm odour of their bodies. And the  grizzly was careful to keep that wind from the right quarter. He could  have gained the top of the mountain more easily and quickly by  quartering the face of it on a back-trail, but this would have thrown  the wind too far under him. As long as he held the wind he was safe,  unless the hunters made an effort to checkmate his method of escape by  detouring and cutting him off.
  It took him half an hour to reach the topmost ridge of rock, from  which point he would have to break cover and reveal himself as he made  the last two or three hundred yards up the shale side of the mountain  to the backbone of the range.
  When Thor made this break he put on a sudden spurt of speed that  left the dogs thirty or forty yards behind him. For two or three  minutes he was clearly outlined on the face of the mountain, and during  the last minute of those three he was splendidly profiled against a  carpet of pure-white snow, without a shrub or a rock to conceal him  from the eyes below.
  Bruce and Langdon saw him at five hundred yards, and began firing.  Close over his head Thor heard the curious ripping wail of the first  bullet, and an instant later came the crack of the rifle.
  A second shot sent up a spurt of snow five yards ahead of him. He  swung sharply to the right. This put him broadside to the marksmen.  Thor heard a third shot&#8212;and that was all.
  While the reports were still echoing among the crags and peaks  something struck Thor a terrific blow on the flat of his skull, five  inches back of his right ear. It was as if a club had descended upon  him from out of the sky. He went down like a log.
  It was a glancing shot. It scarcely drew blood, but for a moment it  stunned the grizzly, as a man is dazed by a blow on the end of the  chin.
  Before he could rise from where he had fallen the dogs were upon  him, tearing at his throat and neck and body. With a roar Thor sprang  to his feet and shook them off. He struck out savagely, and Langdon and  Bruce could hear his bellowing as they stood with fingers on the  triggers of their rifles waiting for the dogs to draw away far enough  to give them the final shots.
  Yard by yard Thor worked his way upward, snarling at the frantic  pack, defying the man-smell, the strange thunder, the burning  lightning&#8212;even death itself, and five hundred yards below Langdon  cursed despairingly as the dogs hung so close he could not fire.
  Up to the very sky-line the blood-thirsting pack shielded Thor. He  disappeared over the summit. The dogs followed. And after that their  baying came fainter and fainter as the big grizzly led them swiftly  away from the menace of man in a long and thrilling race from which  more than one was doomed not to return.
