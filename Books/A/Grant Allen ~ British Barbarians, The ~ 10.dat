At half-past nine one evening that week, Bertram was seated in his  sitting-room at Miss Blake's lodgings, making entries, as usual,  on the subject of taboo in his big black notebook. It was a large  bare room, furnished with the customary round rosewood centre  table, and decorated by a pair of green china vases, a set of wax  flowers under a big glass shade, and a picture representing two  mythical beings, with women's faces and birds' wings, hovering over  the figure of a sleeping baby. Suddenly a hurried knock at the door  attracted his attention. "Come in," he said softly, in that gentle  and almost deferential voice which he used alike to his equals and  to the lodging-house servant. The door opened at once, and Frida  entered.    
She was pale as a ghost, and she stepped light with a terrified  tread. Bertram could see at a glance she was profoundly agitated.  For a moment he could hardly imagine the reason why: then he  remembered all at once the strict harem rules by which married  women in England are hemmed in and circumvented. To visit an  unmarried man alone by night is contrary to tribal usage. He rose,  and advanced towards his visitor with outstretched arms. "Why,  Frida," he cried,--"Mrs. Monteith--no, Frida--what's the matter?  What has happened since I left? You look so pale and startled."    
Frida closed the door cautiously, flung herself down into a chair  in a despairing attitude, and buried her face in her hands for some  moments in silence. "O Mr. Ingledew," she cried at last, looking up  in an agony of shame and doubt: "Bertram--I <i>know</i> it's wrong; I <i>know</i>  it's wicked; I ought never to have come. Robert would kill me if he  found out. But it's my one last chance, and I couldn't <i>bear</i> not to  say good-bye to you--just this once--for ever."    
Bertram gazed at her in astonishment. Long and intimately as he had  lived among the various devotees of divine taboos the whole world  over, it was with difficulty still he could recall, each time, each  particular restriction of the various systems. Then it came home to  him with a rush. He removed the poor girl's hands gently from her  face, which she had buried once more in them for pure shame, and  held them in his own. "Dear Frida," he said tenderly, stroking them  as he spoke, "why, what does all this mean? What's this sudden  thunderbolt? You've come here to-night without your husband's  leave, and you're afraid he'll discover you?"    
Frida spoke under her breath, in a voice half-choked with frequent  sobs. "Don't talk too loud," she whispered. "Miss Blake doesn't  know I'm here. If she did, she'd tell on me. I slipped in quietly  through the open back door. But I felt I <i>must</i>--I really, really  <i>must</i>. I <i>couldn't</i> stop away; I <i>couldn't</i> help it."    
Bertram gazed at her, distressed. Her tone was distressing. Horror  and indignation for a moment overcame him. She had had to slip in  there like a fugitive or a criminal. She had had to crawl away by  stealth from that man, her keeper. She, a grown woman and a moral  agent, with a will of her own and a heart and a conscience, was  held so absolutely in serfdom as a particular man's thrall and  chattel, that she could not even go out to visit a friend without  these degrading subterfuges of creeping in unperceived by a back  entrance, and talking low under her breath, lest a lodging-house  crone should find out what she was doing. And all the world of  England was so banded in league with the slave-driver against the  soul he enslaved, that if Miss Blake had seen her she could hardly  have come in: while, once in, she must tremble and whisper and  steal about with muffled feet, for fear of discovery in this  innocent adventure. He held his breath with stifled wrath. It  was painful and degrading.    
But he had no time just then to think much of all this, for there  sat Frida, tremulous and shivering before his very eyes, trying  hard to hide her beautiful white face in her quivering hands, and  murmuring over and over again in a very low voice, like an agonised  creature, "I couldn't <i>bear</i> not to be allowed to say good-bye to you  for ever."    
Bertram smoothed her cheek gently. She tried to prevent him, but  he went on in spite of her, with a man's strong persistence.  Notwithstanding his gentleness he was always virile. "Good-bye!" he  cried. "Good-bye! why on earth good-bye, Frida? When I left you  before dinner you never said one word of it to me."    
"Oh, no," Frida cried, sobbing. "It's all Robert, Robert! As soon  as ever you were gone, he called me into the library--which always  means he's going to talk over some dreadful business with me--and  he said to me, 'Frida, I've just heard from Phil that this man  Ingledew, who's chosen to foist himself upon us, holds opinions and  sentiments which entirely unfit him from being proper company for  any lady. Now, he's been coming here a great deal too often of  late. Next time he calls, I wish you to tell Martha you're not at  home to him.'"    
Bertram looked across at her with a melting look in his honest blue  eyes. "And you came round to tell me of it, you dear thing!" he  cried, seizing her hand and grasping it hard. "O Frida, how kind of  you!"    
Frida trembled from head to foot. The blood throbbed in her pulse.  "Then you're not vexed with me," she sobbed out, all tremulous with  gladness.    
"Vexed with you! O Frida, how could I be vexed? You poor child!  I'm so pleased, so glad, so grateful!"    
Frida let her hand rest unresisting in his. "But, Bertram," she  murmured,--"I <i>must</i> call you Bertram--I couldn't help it, you know.  I like you so much, I couldn't let you go for ever without just  saying good-bye to you."    
"You <i>don't</i> like me; you <i>love</i> me," Bertram answered with masculine  confidence. "No, you needn't blush, Frida; you can't deceive  me. . . . My darling, you love me, and you know I love you. Why  should we two make any secret about our hearts any longer?" He laid  his hand on her face again, making it tingle with joy. "Frida," he  said solemnly, "you don't love that man you call your husband. . . .  You haven't loved him for years. . . . You never really loved him."    
There was something about the mere sound of Bertram's calm voice  that made Frida speak the truth more plainly and frankly than she  could ever have spoken it to any ordinary Englishman. Yet she hung  down her head, even so, and hesitated slightly. "Just at first,"  she murmured half-inaudibly, "I used to <i>think</i> I loved him. At any  rate, I was pleased and flattered he should marry me."    
"Pleased and flattered!" Bertram exclaimed, more to himself than to  her; "great Heavens, how incredible! Pleased and flattered by that  man! One can hardly conceive it! But you've never loved him since,  Frida. You can't look me in the face and tell me you love him."    
"No, not since the first few months," Frida answered, still hanging  her head. "But, Bertram, he's my husband, and of course I must obey  him."    
"You must do nothing of the sort," Bertram cried authoritatively.  "You don't love him at all, and you mustn't pretend to. It's wrong:  it's wicked. Sooner or later--" He checked himself. "Frida," he  went on, after a moment's pause, "I won't speak to you of what I  was going to say just now. I'll wait a bit till you're stronger and  better able to understand it. But there must be no more silly talk  of farewells between us. I won't allow it. You're mine now--a  thousand times more truly mine than ever you were Monteith's; and I  can't do without you. You must go back to your husband for the  present, I suppose,--the circumstances compel it, though I don't  approve of it; but you must see me again . . . and soon . . . and  often, just the same as usual. I won't go to your house, of course:  the house is Monteith's; and everywhere among civilised and  rational races the sanctity of the home is rightly respected. But  <i>you</i> yourself he has no claim or right to taboo; and if <i>I</i> can help  it, he shan't taboo you. You may go home now to-night, dear one;  but you must meet me often. If you can't come round to my rooms--  for fear of Miss Blake's fetich, the respectability of her house--  we must meet elsewhere, till I can make fresh arrangements."    
Frida gazed up at him in doubt. "But will it be <i>right</i>, Bertram?"  she murmured.    
The man looked down into her big eyes in dazed astonishment. "Why,  Frida," he cried, half-pained at the question, "do you think if it  were <i>wrong</i> I'd advise you to do it? I'm here to help you, to guide  you, to lead you on by degrees to higher and truer life. How can  you imagine I'd ask you to do anything on earth unless I felt  perfectly sure and convinced it was the very most right and proper  conduct?"    
His arm stole round her waist and drew her tenderly towards him.  Frida allowed the caress passively. There was a robust frankness  about his love-making that seemed to rob it of all taint or tinge  of evil. Then he caught her bodily in his arms like a man who has  never associated the purest and noblest of human passions with any  lower thought, any baser personality. He had not taken his first  lessons in the art of love from the wearied lips of joyless  courtesans whom his own kind had debased and unsexed and degraded  out of all semblance of womanhood. He bent over the woman of his  choice and kissed her with chaste warmth. On the forehead first,  then, after a short interval, twice on the lips. At each kiss, from  which she somehow did not shrink, as if recognising its purity,  Frida felt a strange thrill course through and through her. She  quivered from head to foot. The scales fell from her eyes. The  taboos of her race grew null and void within her. She looked up at  him more boldly. "O Bertram," she whispered, nestling close to his  side, and burying her blushing face in the man's curved bosom, "I  don't know what you've done to me, but I feel quite different--as  if I'd eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil."    
"I hope you have," Bertram answered, in a very solemn voice; "for,  Frida, you will need it." He pressed her close against his breast;  and Frida Monteith, a free woman at last, clung there many minutes  with no vile inherited sense of shame or wrongfulness. "I can't  bear to go," she cried, still clinging to him and clutching him  tight. "I'm so happy here, Bertram; oh, so happy, so happy!"    
"Then why go away at all?" Bertram asked, quite simply.    
Frida drew back in horror. "Oh, I must," she said, coming to  herself: "I must, of course, because of Robert."    
Bertram held her hand, smoothing it all the while with his own, as  he mused and hesitated. "Well, it's clearly wrong to go back," he  said, after a moment's pause. "You ought never, of course, to spend  another night with that man you don't love and should never have  lived with. But I suppose that's only a counsel of perfection: too  hard a saying for you to understand or follow for the present.  You'd better go back, just to-night: and, as time moves on, I can  arrange something else for you. But when shall I see you again?--  for now you belong to me. I sealed you with that kiss. When will  you come and see me?"    
"I can't come here, you know," Frida whispered, half-terrified;  "for if I did, Miss Blake would see me."    
Bertram smiled a bitter smile to himself. "So she would," he said,  musing. "And though she's not the least interested in keeping up  Robert Monteith's proprietary claim on your life and freedom, I'm  beginning to understand now that it would be an offence against  that mysterious and incomprehensible entity they call <i>respectability</i>  if she were to allow me to receive you in her rooms. It's all very  curious. But, of course, while I remain, I must be content to  submit to it. By-and-by, perhaps, Frida, we two may manage to  escape together from this iron generation. Meanwhile, I shall go up  to London less often for the present, and you can come and meet me,  dear, in the Middle Mill Fields at two o'clock on Monday."    
She gazed up at him with perfect trust in those luminous dark eyes  of hers. "I will, Bertram," she said firmly. She knew not herself  what his kiss had done for her; but one thing she knew: from the  moment their lips met, she had felt and understood in a flood of  vision that perfect love which casteth out fear, and was no longer  afraid of him.    
"That's right, darling," the man answered, stooping down and laying  his cheek against her own once more. "You are mine, and I am yours.  You are not and never were Robert Monteith's, my Frida. So now,  good-night, till Monday at two, beside the stile in Middle Mill  Meadows!"    
She clung to him for a moment in a passionate embrace. He let her  stop there, while he smoothed her dark hair with one free hand.  Then suddenly, with a burst, the older feelings of her race  overcame her for a minute; she broke from his grasp and hid her  head, all crimson, in a cushion on the sofa. One second later,  again, she lifted her face unabashed. The new impulse stirred her.  "I'm proud I love you, Bertram," she cried, with red lips and  flashing eyes; "and I'm proud you love me!"    
With that, she slipped quietly out, and walked, erect and graceful,  no longer ashamed, down the lodging-house passage.
