Washington was in temporary quarters--a cramped and wretched tavern--at  Liberty Pole, New Jersey. The inaction being oppressive, Hamilton  concentrated his thoughts on the condition and needs of the country.    <blockquote>
 I am sorry that the same spirit of indifference to public affairs   prevails, [he wrote to Sears]. It is necessary we should rouse and   begin to do our business in earnest, or we shall play a losing   game. We must have a government with more power. We must have a tax   in kind. We must have a foreign loan. We must have a bank on the   true principles of a bank. We must have an administration distinct   from Congress, and in the hands of single men under their orders.   We must, above all things, have an army for the war.... We are told   here there is to be a Congress of the neutral powers at the Hague   for meditating of peace. God send it may be true. We want it; but   if the idea goes abroad, ten to one if we do not fancy the thing   done, and fall into a profound sleep till the cannon of the enemy   waken us next campaign. This is our national character.</blockquote>    
Hamilton, the High Priest of Energy, had long since declared war against  the genius of the American people, who believed in God and the art of  leisure. Hamilton believed in God and a cabinet of zealous ministers. He  was already a thorn in the side of estimable but hesitant patriots, and  in times to come his unremitting and remorseless energy was to be a  subject of reproach by associates and enemies alike. Even Jefferson,  that idol of the present as of the past democracy, had timidly declared  against separation in 1774, while Hamilton, a boy of seventeen, had been  the first to suggest the resort to arms, and incessant in his endeavours  until the great result was accomplished. He had countless other schemes,  and he knew that eventually he would succeed in driving the American  people before the point of his quill. That his task would be long and  arduous did not daunt him for a moment. By this time he knew every want  of the country, and was determined upon the reorganization of the  government. The energy which is one of the distinguishing  characteristics of the American nation to-day was generated by Hamilton,  might, indeed, be said to be the persistence and diffusion of his ego.  For the matter of that, all that is greatest in this American evolution  of a century was typified in Hamilton. Not only his formidable energy,  but his unqualified honour and integrity, his unquenchable optimism, his  extraordinary nimbleness of mind and readiness of resource, his gay  good-nature, high spirits, and buoyancy, his light philosophy  effervescing above unsounded depths, his inability to see when he was  beaten, his remorseless industry, his hard common sense, combined with a  versatile cleverness which makes for shallowness in another race, his  careless generosity, his aptitude for detail and impatience of it, his  reckless bravery in war and intrepidity in peace, even his highly strung  nerves, excitability, and obliging readiness at all times for a fight,  raise him high above history as the genius of the American race. The  reverse side of the national character we owe to the greatest of his  rivals; as will be seen hereafter.    
During the sojourn at Liberty Pole, Washington and he sat through many  nights discussing the imperative need of the reorganization of the  government, and the best methods by which it could be accomplished. The  result was Hamilton's letter to James Duane, an important member of the  Congress.    
This letter, no doubt the most remarkable of its kind ever written, and  as interesting to-day as when Hamilton conceived it, is far too long to  be quoted. It began with an exhaustive analysis of the reasons for the  failure of Congress to cope with a situation which was becoming more  threatening every hour, and urged the example of the Grecian republics  and the Swiss cantons against the attempted confederation of the States  without a strong centralized government. Lacking a common tie of  sufficient strength, the States would inevitably drift toward  independent sovereignty, and they had given signal proof in the matter  of raising troops, contributing money, and in their everlasting disputes  about boundary lines, as to the absolute lack of any common public  spirit. His remedy, in brief, was a convention of the States for the  purpose of creating a Federal Constitution, the distributing of the  powers of government into separate departments, with Presidents of War,  Marine, and Trade, a secretary of Foreign Affairs, and a Financier,  defining their prerogatives; the States to have no privileges beyond an  internal police for the protection of the property and the rights of  individuals, and to raise money by internal taxes; the army to be  recruited on a permanent establishment. In addition, there was an  elaborate system of taxation, by which the country could be supported in  all its emergencies. His favourite plan of a National Bank was  elaborated in minute detail, the immediate necessity for a foreign loan  dwelt upon with sharp reproof, and examples given of the recruiting of  armies in European states.    
Out of a multitude of suggestions a few were adopted within a short  time, but the great central suggestion, the calling of a convention for  the purpose of creating a Federal Constitution, was to be hammered at  for many weary years before jealous States and unconfident patriots  could be persuaded to a measure so monarchical and so bold. But the  letter is on record, and nothing more logical, far-sighted, and  comprehensive ever was written. It contained the foundation-stones upon  which this government of the United States stands to-day. Congress put  on its spectacles and read it with many grunts, magnanimously expressing  admiration for a youth who had fearlessly grappled with questions which  addled older brains; but its audacious suggestions of a government  greater than Congress, and of a bank which would add to their troubles,  were not taken seriously for a moment.    
Hamilton also found time to write a good many love letters. Here is one  of them:--    <blockquote>
 I would not have you imagine, Miss, that I write you so often to   gratify your wishes or please your vanity; but merely to indulge   myself, and to comply with that restless propensity of my mind   which will not be happy unless I am doing something in which you   are concerned. This may seem a very idle disposition in a   philosopher and a soldier, but I can plead illustrious examples in   my justification. Achilles liked to have sacrificed Greece and his   glory to a female captive, and Anthony lost a world for a woman. I   am very sorry times are so changed as to oblige me to go to   antiquity for my apology, but I confess, to the disgrace of the   present time, that I have not been able to find as many who are as   far gone as myself in the laudable Zeal of the fair sex. I suspect,   however, if others knew the charm of my sweetheart as I do, I could   have a great number of competitors. I wish I could give you an idea   of her. You can have no conception of how sweet a girl she is. It   is only in my heart that her image is truly drawn. She has a lovely   form and still more lovely mind. She is all goodness, the gentlest,   the dearest, the tenderest of her sex. Ah, Betsey, how I love her!</blockquote>    
His reiterated demand for a foreign loan, and the sending of a special  envoy to obtain it, at last wrung a reluctant consent from Congress.  Lafayette was his politic suggestion, and Congress would have indorsed  it, but that adventurous young hero had not come to America to return  and beg money on his own doorstep. There was a prospect of fighting in  the immediate future, and he was determined to add to his renown. The  choice then lay between Hamilton and Laurens, who had received the  thanks of Congress for his distinguished services in the field, and  whose father had been a president of that body. Lafayette and all the  Frenchmen were anxious that the mission be given to Hamilton. The former  went to Philadelphia and talked to half the Congress. He offered  Hamilton private letters which would introduce him to the best society  of Europe; adding, "I intend giving you the <i>key</i> of the cabinet, as  well as of the societies which influence them."    
Laurens, by this time, was eager to go. His father, who had started for  Holland as Minister Plenipotentiary, had been captured by the British  and confined in the Tower of London; the foreign mission would give him  an opportunity to attempt his liberation. Moreover, life was very dull  at present, and he knew himself to be possessed of diplomatic talents.  But he was also aware of Hamilton's ardent desire to visit Europe, all  that it would mean to that insatiate mind, his weariness of his present  position. Washington would give his consent to the temporary absence of  Hamilton, for the French money was the vital necessity of the Republic's  life, and he knew that his indomitable aide would not return without it  Therefore Laurens wrote to Hamilton, who was in Albany awaiting his  wedding-day, that he should resign in his favour, and congratulated him  on so brilliant and distinguished a honeymoon.    
The struggle in Hamilton's mind was brief. The prospect of sailing with  his bride on a long and delightful journey that could not fail to bring  him highest honour had made his blood dance. Moreover, in the previous  month Washington had again refused his request for an independent  command. It took him but a short time to relinquish this cherished dream  when he thought of the unhappy plight of Mr. Laurens, and remembered the  deep anxiety of the son, often expressed. He wrote to Laurens,  withdrawing in the most decisive terms. Laurens was not to be outdone.  He loved his father, but he loved Hamilton more. He pressed the  appointment upon his friend, protesting that the affairs of the elder  Laurens would be quite as safe in his hands. Hamilton prevailed, and  Congress, having waited amiably while the two martial youths had it out,  unanimously appointed Laurens. He could not sail until February, and as  soon as the matter was decided obtained leave of absence and repaired in  all haste to Albany, to be present at Hamilton's wedding.
