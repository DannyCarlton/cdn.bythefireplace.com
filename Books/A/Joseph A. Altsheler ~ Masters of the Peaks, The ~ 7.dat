  A singular day came when it seemed to Robert that the wind  alternately blew hot and cold, at least by contrast, and the deep,  leaden skies were suffused with a peculiar mist that made him see all  objects in a distorted fashion. Everything was out of proportion. Some  were too large and some too small. Either the world was awry or his own  faculties had become discolored and disjointed. While his interest in  his daily toil decreased and his thoughts were vague and distant, his  curiosity, nevertheless, was keen and concentrated. He knew that  something unusual was going to happen and nature was preparing him for  it.
  The occult quality in the air did not depart with the coming of  night, though the winds no longer alternated, the warm blasts ceasing  to blow, while the cold came steadily and with increasing fierceness.  Yet it was warm and close in the cave, and the two went outside for  air, wandering up the face of the ridge that enclosed the northern side  of their particular valley in the chain of little valleys. Upon the  summit they stood erect, and the face of Tayoga became rapt like that  of a seer. When Robert looked at him his own blood tingled. The  Onondaga shut his eyes, and he spoke not so much to Robert as to the  air itself:
  &#8220;O Tododaho,&#8221; he said, &#8220;when mine eyes are open I do not see you  because of the vast clouds that Manitou has heaped between, but when I  close them the inner light makes me behold you sitting upon your star  and looking down with kindness upon this, the humblest and least of  your servants. O Tododaho, you have given my valiant comrade and myself  a safe home in the wilderness in our great need, and I beseech you that  you will always hold your protecting shield between us and our  enemies.&#8221;
  He paused, his eyes still closed, and stood tense and erect, the  north wind blowing on his face. A shiver ran through Robert, not a  shiver of fear, but a shiver caused by the mysterious and the unknown.  His own eyes were open, and he gazed steadily into the northern  heavens. The occult quality in the air deepened, and now his nerves  began to tingle. His soul thrilled with a coming event. Suddenly the  deep, leaden clouds parted for a few moments, and in the clear space  between he could have sworn that he saw a great dancing star, from  which a mighty, benevolent face looked down upon them.
  &#8220;I saw him! I saw him!&#8221; he exclaimed in excitement. &#8220;It was Tododaho  himself!&#8221;
  &#8220;I did not see him with my eyes, but I saw him with my soul,&#8221; said  the Onondaga, opening his eyes, &#8220;and he whispered to me that his favor  was with us. We cannot fail in what we wish to do.&#8221;
  &#8220;Look in the next valley, Tayoga. What do you behold now?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is the bears, Dagaeoga. They come to their long winter sleep.&#8221;
  Rolling figures, enlarged and fantastic, emerged from the mist.  Robert saw great, red eyes, sharp teeth and claws, and yet he felt  neither fear nor hostility. Tayoga's statement that they were bears,  into which the souls of great warriors had gone, was strong in his  mind, and he believed. They looked up at him, but they did not pause,  moving on to the little caves.
  &#8220;They see us,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;So they do,&#8221; said Tayoga, &#8220;but they do not fear us. The spirits of  mighty warriors look out of their eyes at us, and knowing that they  were once as we are they know also that we will not harm them.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have you ever seen the like of this before, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;No! But a few of the old men of the Hodenosaunee have told of their  grandfathers who have seen it. I think it is a mark of favor to us that  we are permitted to behold such a sight. Now I am sure Tododaho has  looked upon us with great approval. Lo, Dagaeoga, more of them come out  of the mist! Before morning every cave, save those in our own little  corner of the valley, will be filled. All of them gaze up at us,  recognize us as friends and pass on. It is a wonderful sight, Dagaeoga,  and we shall never look upon its like again.&#8221;
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Robert, as the extraordinary thrill ran through him once  more. &#8220;Now they have gone into their caves, and I believe with you,  Tayoga, that the souls of great warriors truly inhabit the bodies of  the bears.&#8221;
  &#8220;And since they are snugly in their homes, ready for the long winter  sleep, lo! the great snow comes, Dagaeoga!&#8221;
  A heavy flake fell on Robert's upturned face, and then another and  another. The circling clouds, thick and leaden, were beginning to pour  down their burden, and the two retreated swiftly to their own dry and  well furnished cave. Then they rolled the great stones before the door,  and Tayoga said:
  &#8220;Now, we will imitate our friends, the bears, and take a long winter  sleep.&#8221;
  Both were soon slumbering soundly in their blankets and furs, and  all that night and all the next day the snow fell on the high mountains  in the heart of which they lay. There was no wind, and it came straight  down, making an even depth on ridge, slope and valley. It blotted out  the mouths of the caves, and it clothed all the forest in deep white.  Robert and Tayoga were but two motes, lost in the vast wilderness,  which had returned to its primeval state, and the Indians themselves,  whether hostile or friendly, sought their villages and lodges and were  willing to leave the war trail untrodden until the months of storm and  bitter cold had passed.
  Robert slept heavily. His labors in preparation for the winter had  been severe and unremitting, and his nerves had been keyed very high by  the arrival of the bears and the singular quality in the air. Now,  nature claimed her toll, and he did not awake until nearly noon, Tayoga  having preceded him a half hour. The Onondaga stood at the door of the  cave, looking over the stones that closed its lower half. Fresh air  poured in at the upper half, but Robert saw there only a whitish veil  like a foaming waterfall.
  &#8220;The time o' day, Sir Tayoga, Knight of the Great Forest,&#8221; he said  lightly and cheerfully.
  &#8220;There is no sun to tell me,&#8221; replied the Onondaga. &#8220;The face of  Areskoui will be hidden long, but I know that at least half the day is  gone. The flakes make a thick and heavy white veil, through which I  cannot see, and great as are the snows every winter on the high  mountains, this will be the greatest of them all.&#8221;
  &#8220;And we've come into our lair. And a mighty fine lair it is, too. I  seem to adapt myself to such a place, Tayoga. In truth, I feel like a  bear myself. You say that the souls of warriors have gone into the  bears about us, and it may be that the soul of a bear has come into  me.&#8221;
  &#8220;It may be,&#8221; said Tayoga, gravely. &#8220;It is at least a wise thought,  since, for a while, we must live like bears.&#8221;
  Robert would have chafed, any other time, at a stay that amounted to  imprisonment, but peace and shelter were too welcome now to let him  complain. Moreover, there were many little but important house-hold  duties to do. They made needles of bone, and threads of sinew and  repaired their clothing. Tayoga had stored suitable wood and bone and  he turned out arrow after arrow. He also made another bow, and Robert,  by assiduous practice, acquired sufficient skill to help in these  tasks. They did not drive themselves now, but the hours being filled  with useful and interesting labor, they were content to wait.
  For three or four days, while the snow still fell, they ate cold  food, but when the clouds at last floated away, and the air was free  from the flakes, they went outside and by great effort&#8212;the snow being  four or five feet deep&#8212;cleared a small space near the entrance, where  they cooked a good dinner from their stores and enjoyed it  extravagantly. Meanwhile the days passed. Robert was impatient at  times, but never a long while. If the mental weariness of waiting came  to him he plunged at once into the tasks of the day.
  There was plenty to do, although they had prepared themselves so  well before the great snowfall came. They made rude shovels of wood and  enlarged the space they had cleared of snow. Here, they fitted stones  together, until they had a sort of rough furnace which, crude though it  was, helped them greatly with their cooking. They also pulled more  brushwood from under the snow, and by its use saved the store they had  heaped up for impossible days. Then, by continued use of the bone  needles and sinews, they managed to make cloaks for themselves of the  bearskins. They were rather shapeless garments, and they had little of  beauty save in the rich fur itself, but they were wonderfully warm and  that was what they wanted most.
  Tayoga, after a while, began slow and painstaking work on a pair of  snowshoes, expecting to devote many days to the task.
  &#8220;The snow is so deep we cannot pass through it,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I, at  least, will pass upon it. I cannot get the best materials, but what I  have will serve. I shall not go far, but I want to explore the country  about us.&#8221;
  Robert thought it a good plan, and helped as well as he could with  the work. They still stayed outdoors as much as possible, but the cold  became intense, the temperature going almost to forty degrees below  zero, the surface of the snow freezing and the boughs of the big trees  about the valley becoming so brittle that they broke with sharp crashes  beneath the weight of accumulated snow. Then they paused long enough in  the work on the snowshoes to make themselves gloves of buckskin, which  were a wonderful help, as they labored in the fresh air. Ear muffs and  caps of bearskin followed.
  &#8220;I feel some reluctance about using bearskin so much,&#8221; said Robert,  &#8220;since the bears about us are inhabited by the souls of great warriors  and are our friends.&#8221;
  &#8220;But the bears that we killed did not belong here,&#8221; said Tayoga,  &#8220;and were bears and nothing more. It was right for us to slay them  because the bear was sent by Manitou to be a support for the Indian  with his flesh and his pelt.&#8221;
  &#8220;But how do you know that the bears we killed were just bears and  bears only?&#8221;
  &#8220;Because, if they had not been we would not have killed them.&#8221;
  Thus were the qualms of young Lennox quieted and he used his  bearskin cap, gloves and cloak without further scruple. The snowshoes  were completed and Tayoga announced that he would start early the next  morning.
  &#8220;I may be gone three or four days, Dagaeoga,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I will  surely return. I shall avoid danger, and do you be careful also.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't fear for me,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;I'm not likely to go farther than  the brook, since there's no great sport in breaking your way through  snow that comes to your waist, and which, moreover, is covered with a  thick sheet of ice. Don't trouble your mind about me, Tayoga, I won't  roam from home.&#8221;
  The Onondaga took his weapons, a supply of food, and departed,  skimming over the snow with wonderful, flying strokes, while Robert  settled down to lonely waiting. It was a hard duty, but he again found  solace in work, and at intervals he contemplated the mouths of the  bears' caves, now almost hidden by the snow. Tayoga's belief was strong  upon him, for the time, and he concluded that the warriors who  inhabited the bodies of the bears must be having some long and  wonderful dreams. At least, they had plenty of time to dream in, and it  was an extraordinary provision of nature that gave them such a  tremendous sleep.
  Tayoga returned in four days, and Robert, who had more than enough  of being alone, welcomed him with hospitable words to a fire and a  feast.
  &#8220;I must first put away my spoils,&#8221; said the Onondaga, his dark eyes  glittering.
  &#8220;Spoils! What spoils, Tayoga?&#8221;
  &#8220;Powder and lead,&#8221; he replied, taking a heavy bundle wrapped in  deerskin from beneath his bearskin overcoat. &#8220;It weighs a full fifty  pounds, and it made my return journey very wearisome. Catch it,  Dagaeoga!&#8221;
  Robert caught, and he saw that it was, in truth, powder and lead.
  &#8220;Now, where did you get this?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You couldn't have gone  to any settlement!&#8221;
  &#8220;There is no settlement to go to. I made our enemies furnish the  powder and lead we need so much, and that is surely the cheapest way.  Listen, Dagaeoga. I remembered that to the east of us, about two days'  journey, was a long valley sheltered well and warm, in which Indians  who fight the Hodenosaunee often camp. I thought it likely they would  be there in such a winter as this, and that I might take from them in  the night the powder and lead we need so much.
  &#8220;I was right. The savages were there, and with them a white man, a  Frenchman, that Charles Langlade, called the Owl, from whom we fled.  They had an abundance of all things, and they were waxing fat, until  they could take the war path in the spring. Then, Dagaeoga, I played  the fox. At night, when they dreamed of no danger, I entered their  biggest lodges, passing as one of them, and came away with the powder  and lead.&#8221;
  &#8220;It was a great feat, Tayoga, but are you sure none of them will  trail you here?&#8221;
  &#8220;The surface of the snow and ice melts a little in the noonday sun,  enough to efface all trace of the snowshoes, and my trail is no more  than that made by a bird in its flight through the air. Nor can we be  followed here while we are guarded by the bears, who sleep, but who,  nevertheless, are sentinels.&#8221;
  Tayoga took off his snowshoes, and sank upon a heap of furs in the  cave, while Robert brought him food and inspected the great prize of  ammunition he had brought. The package contained a dozen huge horns  filled with powder, and many small bars of lead, the latter having made  the weight which had proved such a severe trial to the Onondaga.
  &#8220;Here's enough of both lead and powder to last us throughout the  winter, whatever may happen,&#8221; said Robert in a tone of intense  satisfaction. &#8220;Tayoga, you're certainly a master freebooter. You  couldn't have made a more useful capture.&#8221;
  Each, after the invariable custom of hunters and scouts, carried  bullet molds, and they were soon at work, melting the lead and casting  bullets for their rifles, then pouring the shining pellets in a stream  into their pouches. They continued at the task from day to day until  all the lead was turned into bullets and then they began work on  another pair of snowshoes, these intended for Robert.
  Despite the safety and comfort of their home in the rock, both began  to chafe now, and time grew tremendously long. They had done nearly  everything they could do for themselves, and life had become so easy  that there was leisure to think and be restless, because they were far  away from great affairs.
  &#8220;When my snowshoes are finished and I perfect myself in the use of  them,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;I favor an attempt to escape on the ice and snow  to the south. We grow rusty, you and I, here, Tayoga. The war may be  decided in our absence and I want to see Dave, too. I want to hear him  tell how he got through the savage cordon to the lake.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have no fear about the war, Dagaeoga,&#8221; said the Onondaga. &#8220;It will  not be ended this winter nor the next. Before there is peace between  the French king and the British king you will have a chance to make  many speeches. Yet, like you, I think we should go. It is not well for  us to lie hidden in the ground through a whole winter.&#8221;
  &#8220;But when we leave our good home here I shall leave many regrets  behind.&#8221;
  He looked around at the cave and its supplies of skins and furs, its  stores of wood and food. Fortune had helped their own skill and they  had made a marvelous change in the place. Its bleakness and bareness  had disappeared. In the cold and bitter wilderness it offered more than  comfort, it was luxury itself.
  &#8220;So shall I,&#8221; said Tayoga, appreciatively, &#8220;but we will heap rocks  up to the very top of the door, so that only a little air and nothing  else can enter, and leave it as it is. Some day we may want to use it  again.&#8221;
  Having decided to go, they became very impatient, but they did not  skimp the work on the snowshoes, knowing how much depended on their  strength, but that task too, like all the others, came to an end in  time. Robert practiced a while and they selected a day of departure.  They were to take with them all the powder and bullets, a large supply  of food and their heavy bearskin overcoats. They had also made for  themselves over-moccasins of fur and extra deerskin leggings. They  would be bundled up greatly, but it was absolutely necessary in order  to face the great cold, that hovered continuously around thirty to  forty degrees below zero. The ear muffs, the caps and the gloves, too,  were necessities, but they had the comfort of believing that if the  fierce winter presented great difficulties to them, it would also keep  their savage enemies in their lodges.
  &#8220;The line that shut us in in the autumn has thinned out and gone!&#8221;  exclaimed Robert in sanguine tones, &#8220;and we'll have a clear path from  here to the lake!&#8221;
  Then they rolled stones, as they had planned, before the door to  their home, closing it wholly except a few square inches at the top,  and ascended on their snowshoes to the crest of the ridge.
  &#8220;Our cave will not be disturbed, at least not this winter,&#8221; said  Tayoga confidently. &#8220;The bears that sleep below are, as I told you, the  silent sentinels, and they will guard it for us until we come again.&#8221;
  &#8220;At least, they brought us good luck,&#8221; said Robert. Then, with long,  gliding strokes they passed over the ridge, and their happy valley was  lost to sight. They did not speak again for hours, Tayoga leading the  way, and each bending somewhat to his task, which was by no means a  light one, owing to the weight they carried, and the extremely  mountainous nature of the country. The wilderness was still and  intensely cold. The deep snow was covered by a crust of ice, and,  despite vigorous exertion and warm clothing, they were none too warm.
  By noon Robert's ankle, not thoroughly hardened to the snowshoes,  began to chafe, and they stopped to rest in a dense grove, where the  searching north wind was turned aside from them. They were traveling by  the sun for the south end of Lake George, but as they were in the vast  plexus of mountains, where their speed could not be great, even under  the best of conditions, they calculated that they would be many days  and nights on the way.
  They stayed fully an hour in the shelter of the trees, and an hour  later came to a frozen lake over which the traveling was easy, but  after they had passed it they entered a land of close thickets, in  which their progress was extremely slow. At night, the cold was very  great, but, as they scooped out a deep hollow in the snow, though they  attempted no fire, they were able to keep warm within their bearskins.  A second and a third day passed in like fashion, and their progress to  the south was unimpeded, though slow. They beheld no signs of human  life save their own, but invariably in the night, and often in the day,  they heard distant wolves howling.
  On the fourth day the temperature rose rapidly and the surface of  the snow softened, making their southward march much harder. Their  snowshoes clogged so much and the strain upon their ankles grew so  great that they decided to go into camp long before sunset, and give  themselves a thorough rest. They also scraped away the snow and lighted  a fire for the first time, no small task, as the snow was still very  deep, and it required much hunting to find the fallen wood. But when  the cheerful blaze came they felt repaid for all their trouble. They  rejoiced in the glow for an hour or so, and then Tayoga decided that he  would go on a short hunting trip along the course of a stream that they  could see about a quarter of a mile below.
  &#8220;It may be that I can rouse up a deer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are likely to  be in the shelter of the thick bushes along the water's edge, but  whether I find them or not I will return shortly after sundown. Do you  await me here, Dagaeoga.&#8221;
  &#8220;I won't stir. I'm too tired,&#8221; said Robert.
  The Onondaga put on his snowshoes again, and strapped to his back  his share of the ammunition and supplies&#8212;it had been agreed by the two  that neither should ever go anywhere without his half, lest they become  separated. Then he departed on smooth, easy strokes, almost like one  who skated, and was soon out of sight among the bushes at the edge of  the stream. Robert settled back to the warmth and brightness of the  fire, and awaited in peace the sound of a shot telling that Tayoga had  found the deer.
  He had been so weary, and the blaze was so soothing that he sank  into a state, not sleep, but nevertheless full of dreams. He saw Willet  again, and heard him tell the tale how he had reached the lake and the  army with Garay's letter. He saw Colonel Johnson, and the young English  officer, Grosvenor, and Colden and Wilton and Carson and all his old  friends, and then he heard a crunch on the snow near him. Had Tayoga  come back so soon and without his deer? He did not raise his drooping  eyelids until he heard the crunch again, and then when he opened them  he sprang suddenly to his feet, his heart beating fast with alarm.
  A half dozen dark figures rushed upon him. He snatched at his rifle  and tried to meet the first of them with a bullet, but the range was  too close. He nevertheless managed to get the muzzle in the air and  pull the trigger. He remembered even in that terrible moment to do that  much and Tayoga would hear the sharp, lashing report. Then the horde  was upon him. Someone struck him a stunning blow on the side of the  head with the flat of a tomahawk, and he fell unconscious.
  When he returned to the world, the twilight had come, the hole in  the snow had been enlarged very much, and so had the fire. Seated  around it were a dozen Indians, wrapped in thick blankets and armed  heavily, and one white man whose attire was a strange compound of  savage and civilized. He wore a three-cornered French military hat with  a great, drooping plume of green, an immense cloak of fine green cloth,  lined with fur, but beneath it he was clothed in buckskin.
  The man himself was as picturesque as his attire. He was young, his  face was lean and bold, his nose hooked and fierce like that of a Roman  leader, his skin, originally fair, now tanned almost to a mahogany  color by exposure, his figure of medium height, but obviously very  powerful. Robert saw at once that he was a Frenchman and he felt  instinctively that it was Langlade. But his head was aching from the  blow of the tomahawk, and he waited in a sort of apathy.
  &#8220;So you've come back to earth,&#8221; said the Frenchman, who had seen his  eyes open&#8212;he spoke in good French, which Robert understood perfectly.
  &#8220;I never had any intention of staying away,&#8221; replied young Lennox.
  The Frenchman laughed.
  &#8220;At least you show a proper spirit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I commend you also  for managing to fire your rifle, although the bullet hit none of us. It  gave the alarm to your comrade and he got clean away. I can make a  guess as to who you are.&#8221;
  &#8220;My name is Robert Lennox.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought so, and your comrade was Tayoga, the Onondaga who is not  unknown to us, a great young warrior, I admit freely. I am sorry we did  not take him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't think you'll get a chance to lay hands on him. He'll be too  clever for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I admit that, too. He's gone like the wind on his snowshoes. It  seems queer that you and he should be here in the mountain wilderness  so far north of your lines, in the very height of a fierce winter.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's just as queer that you should be here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Perhaps so, from your point of view, though it's lucky that I  should have been present with these dark warriors of mine when you were  taken. They suffered heavily in the battle by Andiatarocte, and but for  me they might now be using you as fuel. Don't wince, you know their  ways and I only tell a fact. In truth, I can't make you any promise in  regard to your ultimate fate, but, at present, I need you alive more  than I need you dead.&#8221;
  &#8220;You won't get any military information out of me.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't know. We shall wait and see.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you know the Chevalier de St. Luc?&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course. All Frenchmen and all Canadians know him, or know of  him, but he is far from here, and we shall not tell him that we have a  young American prisoner. The chevalier is a great soldier and the  bravest of men, but he has one fault. He does not hate the English and  the Bostonnais enough.&#8221;
  Robert was not bound, but his arms and snowshoes had been taken and  the Indians were all about him. There was no earthly chance of escape.  With the wisdom of the wise he resigned himself at once to his  situation, awaiting a better moment.
  &#8220;I'm at your command,&#8221; he said politely to Langlade.
  The French leader laughed, partly in appreciation.
  &#8220;You show intelligence,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You do not resist, when you see  that resistance is impossible.&#8221;
  Robert settled himself into a more comfortable position by the fire.  His head still ached, but it was growing easier. He knew that it was  best to assume a careless and indifferent tone.
  &#8220;I'm not ready to leave you now,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I shall go later.&#8221;
  Langlade laughed again, and then directed two of the Indians to hunt  more wood. They obeyed. Robert saw that they never questioned his  leadership, and he saw anew how the French partisans established  themselves so thoroughly in the Indian confidence. The others threw  away more snow, making a comparatively large area of cleared ground,  and, when the wood was brought, they built a great fire, around which  all of them sat and ate heartily from their packs.
  Langlade gave Robert food which he forced himself to eat, although  he was not hungry. He judged that the French partisan, who could be  cruel enough on occasion, had some object in treating him well for the  present, and he was not one to disturb such a welcome frame of mind.  His weapons and the extra rifle of Garay that they had brought with  them, had already been divided among the warriors, who, pleased with  the reward, were content to wait.
  The night was spent at the captured camp, and in the morning the  entire party, Robert included, started on snowshoes almost due north.  The young prisoner felt a sinking of the heart, when his face was  turned away from his own people, and he began an unknown captivity. He  had been certain at first of escape, but it did not seem so sure now.  In former wars many prisoners taken on raids into Canada had never been  heard of again, and when he reflected in cold blood he knew that the  odds were heavy against a successful flight. Yet there was Tayoga. His  warning shot had enabled the Onondaga to evade the band, and his  comrade would never desert him. All his surpassing skill and tenacity  would be devoted to his aid. In that lay his hope.
  They pressed on toward the north as fast as they could go, and when  night came they were all exhausted, but they ate heavily again and  Robert received his share. Langlade continued to treat him kindly,  though he still had the feeling that the partisan, if it served him,  would be fully as cruel as the Indians. At night, although they built  big fires, Langlade invariably posted a strong watch, and Robert  noticed also that he usually shared it, or a part of it, from which  habit he surmised that the partisan had received the name of the Owl.  He had hoped that Tayoga might have a chance to rescue him in the dark,  but he saw now that the vigilance was too great.
  He hid his intense disappointment and kept as cheerful a face as he  could. Langlade, the only white man in the Indian band, was drawn to  him somewhat by the mere fact of racial kinship, and the two frequently  talked together in the evenings in what was a sort of compulsory  friendliness, Robert in this manner picking up scraps of information  which when welded together amounted to considerable, being thus  confirmed in his belief that Willet with the letter had reached the  lake in time. St. Luc with a formidable force had undertaken a swift  march on Albany, but the town had been put in a position of defense,  and St. Luc's vanguard had been forced to retreat by a large body of  rangers after a severe conflict. As the success of the chevalier's  daring enterprise had depended wholly on surprise, he had then  withdrawn northward.
  But Robert could not find out by any kind of questions where St. Luc  was, although he learned that Garay had never returned to Albany and  that Hendrik Martinus had made an opportune flight. Langlade, who was  thoroughly a wilderness rover, talked freely and quite boastfully of  the French power, which he deemed all pervading and invincible. Despite  the battle at Lake George the fortunes of war had gone so far in favor  of France and Canada and against Britain and the Bostonnais. When the  great campaign was renewed in the spring more and bigger victories  would crown French valor. The Owl grew expansive as he talked to the  youth, his prisoner.
  &#8220;The Marquis de Montcalm is coming to lead all our armies,&#8221; he said,  &#8220;and he is a far abler soldier than Dieskau. You really did us a great  service when you captured the Saxon. Only a Frenchman is fit to lead  Frenchmen, and under a mighty captain we will crush you. The Bostonnais  are not the equal of the French in the forest. Save a few like Willet,  and Rogers, the English and Americans do not learn the ways of woods  warfare, nor do you make friends with the Indians as we do.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is true in the main,&#8221; responded Robert, &#8220;but we shall win  despite it. Both the English and the English Colonials have the power  to survive defeat. Can the French and the Canadians do as well?&#8221;
  Langlade could not be shaken in his faith. He saw nothing but the  most brilliant victories, and not only did he boast of French power,  but he gloried even more in the strength of the Indian hordes, that had  come and that were coming in ever increasing numbers to the help of  France. Only the Hodenosaunee stood aloof from Quebec, and he believed  the Great League even yet would be brought over to his side.
  Robert argued with the Owl, but he made no impression upon him.  Meanwhile they continued to march north by west.
