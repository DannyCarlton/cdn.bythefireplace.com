  There was music that night in Le Pas. Jan heard it before he came  to  the first of the scattered lights, and the dogs pricked up their  ears.  Kazan, the one-eyed, whined under his breath, and the weight at  Jan's  heart grew heavier as the dog turned up his head to him in the   starlight. It was strange music, nothing like Jan had ever heard. It   was strange to Kazan, and set him whining, and he thrust his muzzle up   to his master's touch inquiringly. They passed on like shadows, close   to a big, lighted log building from which the music came, and with it   a tumult of laughter, of shuffling and stamping feet, of coarse   singing and loud voices. A door opened and a man and a woman came out.   The man was cursing, and the woman was laughing at him&#8212;laughing as   Jan had never heard a woman laugh before, and he held his breath as he   listened to the taunting mockery in it. Others followed the first man   and the first woman. Some passed quietly. A woman, escorted between   two men, screamed with merriment as she flung toward his shadowy   figure an object which fell with a crash against the sledge. It was a   bottle. Kazan snarled. The trace-dogs slunk close to the leader's   heels. With a low word Jan led them on. 
  Close down to the river, where the Saskatchewan swung in a  half-moon  to the south and west, he found a low, squat building with a  light  hung over the door illuminating a bit of humor in the form of a   printed legend which said that it was &quot;King Edward's Hotel.&quot; The scrub   bush of the forest grew within a hundred yards of it, and in this bush   Jan tied his dogs and left his sledge. It did not occur to him that   now, when he had entered civilization, he had come also into the land   of lock and bolt, of robbers and thieves. It was loneliness, and not   suspicion, that sent him back to unleash Kazan and take him with him. 
  They entered the hotel, Kazan with suspicious caution. The door  opened  into a big room lighted by an oil lamp, turned low. The room  was empty  except for a solitary figure sitting in a chair, facing a  wide window  which looked into the north. Making no sound, that he  might not  disturb this other occupant, Jan also seated himself before  the  window. Kazan laid his wolfish head across his master's knees, his  one  eye upon him steadily and questioningly. Never in all his years of   life had Jan felt the depth of loneliness that swept upon him now, as   he looked into the North. Below him the Saskatchewan lay white and   silent; beyond it he could see the dark edge of the forest, and far,   far, beyond that, hovering low in the sky, the polar star. It burned   faintly now, almost like a thousand other stars that he saw, and the   aurora was only a fading glow. 
  Something rose up in Jan's throat and choked him, and he closed his   eyes, with his fingers clutching Kazan's head. In spite of the battle   that he had fought, his mind swept back&#8212;back through the endless   silent spaces, over mountains and through forests, swift, resistless,   until once more the polar star flashed in all its glory over his head,   and he was at Lac Bain. He did not know that he was surrendering to   hunger, exhaustion, the cumulative effects of his thirteen days' fight   in the forests. He was with M&eacute;lisse again, with the old violin, with   the things that they had loved. He forgot in these moments that there   was another in the room; he heard no sound as the man shifted his   position so that he looked steadily at him and Kazan. It was the low,   heart-broken sob of grief that fell from his own lips that awakened   him again to a consciousness of the present. 
  He jerked himself erect, and found Kazan with his fangs gleaming.  The  stranger had risen. He was standing close to him, leaning down,   staring at him in the dim lamplight, and as Jan lifted his own eyes he   knew that in the pale, eager face of the man above him there was   written a grief which might have been a reflection of his own. For a   full breath or two they looked, neither speaking, and the hair along   Kazan's spine stood stiff. Something reached out to Jan and set his   tired blood tingling. He knew that this man was not a forest man. He   was not of his people. His face bore the stamp of the people to the   south, of civilization. And yet something passed between them, leaped   all barriers, and made them friends before they had spoken. The   stranger reached down his hand, and Jan reached up his. All of the   loneliness, the clinging to hope, the starving desire of two men for   companionship, passed in the long grip of their hands. 
  &quot;You have just come down,&quot; said the man, half questioningly. &quot;That  was  your sledge&#8212;out there?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Jan. 
  The stranger sat down in the chair next to Jan. 
  &quot;From the camps?&quot; he questioned eagerly. 
  &quot;What camps, m'sieur?&quot; 
  &quot;The railroad camps, where they are putting the new line through,   beyond Wekusko.&quot; 
  &quot;I know of no camps,&quot; said Jan simply. &quot;I know of no railroad,  except  this that comes to Le Pas. I come from Lac Bain, on the edge of  the  barren lands.&quot; 
  &quot;You have never been down before?&quot; asked the stranger softly. Jan   wondered at the light in his eyes. 
  &quot;A long time ago,&quot; he said, &quot;for a day. I have passed all of my  life&#8212;  up there.&quot; Jan pointed to the north, and the other's eyes  turned to  where the polar star was fading low in the sky. 
  &quot;And I have passed all of my life DOWN THERE,&quot; he replied, nodding  his  head to the south. &quot;A year ago I came up here for&#8212;for health and   happiness,&quot; he laughed nervously. &quot;I found them both. But I'm leaving   them. I'm going back to-morrow. My name is Thornton,&quot; he added,   holding out his hand again. &quot;I come from Chicago.&quot; 
  &quot;My name is Thoreau&#8212;Jan Thoreau,&quot; said Jan. &quot;I have read of  Chicago  in a book, and have seen pictures of it. Is it larger than the  city  that is called Winnipeg?&quot; 
  He looked at Thornton, and Thornton turned his head a little so  that  the light did not shine in his face. The grip of his fingers  tightened  about Jan's hand. 
  &quot;Yes, it is larger.&quot; 
  &quot;The officers of the great company are at Winnipeg, and Le   Commissionaire, are they not, m'sieur?&quot; 
  &quot;Of the Hudson's Bay Company&#8212;yes.&quot; 
  &quot;And if there was business to do&#8212;important business, m'sieur,  would  it not be best to go to Le Commissionaire?&quot; questioned Jan. 
  Thornton looked hard at the tense eagerness in Jan's face. 
  &quot;There are nearer headquarters, at Prince Albert,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;That is not far,&quot; exclaimed Jan, rising. &quot;And they would do  business  there&#8212;important business?&quot; He dropped his hand to Kazan's  head, and  half turned toward the door. 
  &quot;Perhaps better than the Commissioner,&quot; replied Thornton. &quot;It might   depend&#8212;on what your business is.&quot; 
  To them, as each stood for a moment in silence, there came the low   wailing of a dog out in the night. 
  &quot;They are calling for Kazan,&quot; said Jan quietly, as though he had  not  read the question in Thornton's last words. &quot;Good night, m'sieur!&quot; 
  The dogs were sitting upon their haunches, waiting, when Jan and  Kazan  went back to them. Jan drew them farther back, where the thick  spruce  shut them out from the clearing, and built a fire. Over this he  hung  his coffee-pail and a big chunk of frozen caribou meat, and  tossed  frozen fish to the hungry dogs. Then he pulled down spruce  boughs and  spread his heavy blankets out near the fire, and waited for  the coffee  and meat to cook. The huskies were through when he began  eating, and  they lay on their bellies, close about his feet, ready to  snap at the  scraps which he threw them. Jan noticed, as he ate, that  there was  left in them none of the old, fierce, fighting spirit. They  did not  snap or snarl. There was no quarreling when he threw bits of  meat to  them, and he found himself wondering if they, too, were filled  with  the sickness which was eating at his own heart. 
  With this sickness, this deathly feeling of loneliness and  heartache,  there had entered into Jan now a strange sensation that was  almost  excitement&#8212;an eagerness to fasten the dogs in their traces, to  hurry  on, in spite of his exhaustion, to that place which Thornton had  told  him of&#8212;Prince Albert, and to free himself there, for all time,  of the  thing which had oppressed him since that night many years ago,  when he  had staggered into Lac Bain to play his violin as Cummins'  wife died.  He reached inside his skin coat and there he felt papers  which he had  taken from the hole in the lob-stick tree. They were  safe. For twenty  years he had guarded them. To-morrow he would take  them to the great  company at Prince Albert. And after that&#8212;after he  had done this  thing, what would there remain in life for Jan Thoreau?  Perhaps the  company might take him, and he would remain in  civilization. That  would be best&#8212;for him. He would fight against the  call of his forests  as years and years ago he had fought against that  call of the Other  World that had filled him with unrest for a time. He  had killed THAT.  If he DID return to his forests, he would go far to  the west, or far  to the east. No one that had ever known him would  hear again of Jan  Thoreau. 
  Kazan had crept to his blanket, daring to encroach upon it inch by   inch, until his great wolf-head lay upon Jan's arm. It was ten years   ago that Jan had taken Kazan, a little half-blind puppy that he and   M&eacute;lisse had chosen from a litter of half a dozen stronger brothers and   sisters. Kazan was all that was left to him now. He loved the other   dogs, but they were not like Kazan. He tightened his arm about the   dog's head. Exhaustion, and the warmth of the fire, made him drowsy,   and, after a time, he slept, with his head thrown back against the   tree. 
  Something awoke him, hours afterward. He opened his eyes, and found   that the fire was still burning brightly. On the far side of it,   beyond the dogs, sat Thornton. A look at the sky, where the stars were   dying, and Jan knew that it was just before the gray break of dawn. He   sat upright. Thornton laughed softly at him, and puffed out clouds of   smoke from his pipe. 
  &quot;You were freezing,&quot; he said, as Jan stared, &quot;and sleeping like a  dead  man. I waited for you back there, and then hunted you up. You  know&#8212;I  thought&#8212;&quot; He hesitated, and knocked the ash from his pipe  bowl. Then  he looked frankly and squarely at Jan. &quot;See here, old man,  if you're  hard up&#8212;had trouble of any sort&#8212;bad luck&#8212;got no  money&#8212;won't you  let me help you out?&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, m'sieur&#8212;I have money,&quot; said Jan. &quot;I prefer to sleep   outside with the dogs. Mon Dieu, I guess I would have been stiff with   the frost if you had not come. You have been here&#8212;all night?&quot; 
  Thornton nodded. 
  &quot;And it is morning,&quot; exclaimed Jan, rising and looking above the   spruce tops. &quot;You are kind, m'sieur. I wish I might do as much for   you.&quot; 
  &quot;You can,&quot; said Thornton quietly. &quot;Where are you going&#8212;from here?&quot; 
  &quot;To the company's offices at Prince Albert. We will start within an   hour.&quot; 
  &quot;Will you take me with you?&quot; Thornton asked. 
  &quot;With pleasure!&quot; cried Jan. &quot;But it will be a hard journey,  m'sieur. I  must hurry, and you may not be accustomed to running behind  the dogs.&quot; 
  Thornton rose and stretched out a hand. 
  &quot;It can't be too hard for me,&quot; he said. &quot;I wish&#8212;&quot; 
  He stopped, and something in his low voice made Jan look straight  into  his eyes. For a moment they gazed at each other in silence, and  again  Jan saw in Thornton's face the look of loneliness and grief  which he  had first seen in the half gloom of the hotel. It was the  suppressed  note in Thornton's voice, of despair almost, that struck  him deepest,  and made him hold the other's hand a moment longer. Then  he turned to  his pack upon the sledge. 
  &quot;I've got meat and coffee and hard biscuits,&quot; he said. &quot;Will you  have  breakfast with me?&quot; 
  That day Jan and Thornton made fifty miles westward over the level   surface of the Saskeram, and camped again on the Saskatchewan. The   second day they followed the river, passed the Sipanock, and struck   south and west over the snow-covered ice for Prince Albert. It was   early afternoon of the fourth day when at last they came to the town. 
  &quot;We will go to the offices of the great company,&quot; said Jan. &quot;We  will  lose no time.&quot; 
  It was Thornton now who guided him to the century-old building at  the  west edge of the town. It was Thornton who led him into an office   filled mostly with young women, who were laboring at clicking   machines; and it was Thornton who presented a square bit of white card   to a gray-haired man at a desk, who, after reading it, rose from his   chair, bowed, and shook hands with him. And a few moments later a door   opened, and Jan Thoreau, alone, passed through it, his heart   quivering, his breath choking him, his hand clutching at the papers in   his breast pocket. 
  Outside Thornton waited. An hour passed and still the door did not   reopen. The man at the desk glanced curiously at Thornton. Two girls   at typewriters exchanged whispered opinions as to who might be this   wild-looking creature from the north who was taking up an hour of the   sub-commissioner's time. Nearly two hours passed before Jan appeared.   Thornton, still patient, rose as the door opened. His eyes first   encountered the staring face of the sub-commissioner. Then Jan came   out. He had aged five years in two hours. There was a tired stoop to   his shoulders, a strange pallor in his cheeks. To Thornton his thin   face seemed to have grown thinner. With bowed head, looking nowhere   but ahead of him, Jan passed on, and as the last door opened to let   them out into the pale winter sun, Thornton heard the muffled sobbing   of his breath. His fingers gripped Jan's arm, his eyes were blazing. 
  &quot;If you're getting the wrong end of anything up there,&quot; he cried   fiercely; &quot;if you're in trouble, and they're taking the blood out of   you&#8212;tell me and I'll put the clamps on 'em, so 'elp me God! They'll   buck the devil when they buck Jack Thornton, and if it needs money to   show 'em so, I've got half a million to teach 'em the game!&quot; 
  &quot;Thanks, m'sieur,&quot; struggled Jan, striving to keep a lump out of  his  throat. &quot;It's nothing like that. I don't need money. Half a  million  would just about buy&#8212;what I've given away up there.&quot; 
  He clutched his hand for an instant to the empty pocket where the   papers had been.
