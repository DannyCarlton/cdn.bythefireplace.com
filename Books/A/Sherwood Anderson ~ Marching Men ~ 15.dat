Chicago is a vast city and millions of people live within the limits  of its influence. It stands at the heart of America almost within  sound of the creaking green leaves of the corn in the vast corn fields  of the Mississippi Valley. It is inhabited by hordes of men of all  nations who have come across the seas or out of western corn--shipping  towns to make their fortunes. On all sides men are busy making  fortunes.    
In little Polish villages the word has been whispered about, "In  America one gets much money," and adventurous souls have set forth  only to land at last, a little perplexed and disconcerted, in narrow  ill--smelling rooms in Halstead Street in Chicago.    
In American villages the tale has been told. Here it has not been  whispered but shouted. Magazines and newspapers have done the job. The  word regarding the making of money runs over the land like a wind  among the corn. The young men listen and run away to Chicago. They  have vigour and youth but in them has been builded no dream no  tradition of devotion to anything but gain.    
Chicago is one vast gulf of disorder. Here is the passion for gain,  the very spirit of the bourgeoise gone drunk with desire. The result  is something terrible. Chicago is leaderless, purposeless, slovenly,  down at the heels.    
And back of Chicago lie the long corn fields that are not disorderly.  There is hope in the corn. Spring comes and the corn is green. It  shoots up out of the black land and stands up in orderly rows. The  corn grows and thinks of nothing but growth. Fruition comes to the  corn and it is cut down and disappears. Barns are filled to bursting  with the yellow fruit of the corn.    
And Chicago has forgotten the lesson of the corn. All men have  forgotten. It has never been told to the young men who come out of the  corn fields to live in the city.    
Once and once only in modern times the soul of America was stirred.  The Civil War swept like a purifying fire through the land. Men  marched together and knew the feel of shoulder to shoulder action.  Brown stout bearded figures returned after the war to the villages.  The beginning of a literature of strength and virility arose.    
And then the time of sorrow and of stirring effort passed and  prosperity returned. Only the aged are now cemented together by the  sorrow of that time and there has been no new national sorrow.    
It is a summer evening in America and the citizens sit in their houses  after the effort of the day. They talk of the children in school or of  the new difficulty of meeting the high prices of food stuff. In cities  the bands play in the parks. In villages the lights go out and one  hears the sound of hurrying horses on distant roads.    
A thoughtful man walking in the streets of Chicago on such an evening  sees women in white shirt waists and men with cigars in their mouths  who sit on the porches of the houses. The man is from Ohio. He owns a  factory in one of the large industrial towns there and has come to the  city to sell his product. He is a man of the better sort, quiet,  efficient, kindly. In his own community every one respects him and he  respects himself. Now he walks and gives himself over to thoughts. He  passes a house set among trees where a man cuts grass by the streaming  light from a window. The song of the lawn mower stirs the walker. He  idles along the street and looks in through the windows at Prints upon  the walls. A white--clad woman sits playing on a piano. "Life is  good," he says, lighting a cigar; "it climbs on and up toward a kind  of universal fairness."    
And then in the light from a street lamp the walker sees a man  staggering along the sidewalk, muttering and helping himself with his  hands upon a wall. The sight does not greatly disturb the pleasant  satisfying thoughts that stir in his mind. He has eaten a good dinner  at the hotel, he knows that drunken men are often but gay money-  spending dogs who to-morrow morning will settle down to their work  feeling secretly better for the night of wine and song.    
My thoughtful man is an American with the disease of comfort and  prosperity in his blood. He strolls along and turns a corner. He is  satisfied with the cigar he smokes and, he decides, satisfied with the  age in which he lives. "Agitators may howl," he says, "but on the  whole life is good, and as for me I am going to spend my life  attending to the business in hand."    
The walker has turned a corner into a side street. Two men emerge from  the door of a saloon and stand upon the sidewalk under a light. They  wave their arms up and down. Suddenly one of them springs forward and  with a quick forward thrust of his body and the flash of a clenched  fist in the lamp light knocks his companion into the gutter. Down the  street he sees rows of tall smoke-begrimed brick buildings hanging  black and ominous against the sky. At the end of a street a huge  mechanical apparatus lifts cars of coal and dumps them roaring and  rattling into the bowels of a ship that lies tied in the river.    
The walker throws his cigar away and looks about. A man walks before  him in the silent street. He sees the man raise his fist to the sky  and notes with a shock the movement of the lips and the hugeness and  ugliness of the face in the lamplight.    
Again he goes on, hurrying now, around another corner into a street  filled with pawn shops, clothing stores and the clamour of voices. In  his mind floats a picture. He sees two boys, clad in white rompers,  feeding clover to a tame rabbit in a suburban back lawn and wishes he  were at home in his own place. In his fancy the two sons are walking  under apple trees and laughing and tusseling for a great bundle of  newly pulled sweet smelling clover. The strange looking red man with  the huge face he has seen in the street is looking at the two children  over a garden wall. There is a threat in the look and the threat  alarms him. Into his mind comes the notion that the man who looks over  the wall wants to destroy the future of his children.    
The night advances. Down a stairway beside a clothing store comes a  woman with gleaming white teeth who is clad in a black dress. She  makes a Peculiar little jerking movement with her head to the walker.  A patrol wagon with clanging bells rushes through the street, two blue  clad policemen sitting stiffly in the seat. A boy--he can't be above  six--runs along the street pushing soiled newspapers under the noses  of idlers on the corners, his shrill childish voice rises above the  din of the trolley cars and the clanging notes of the patrol wagon.    
The walker throws his cigar into the gutter and climbing the steps of  a street car goes back to his hotel. His fine reflective mood is gone.  He half wishes that something lovely might come into American life but  the wish does not persist. He is only irritated and feels that a  pleasant evening has been in some way spoiled. He is wondering if he  will be successful in the business that brought him to the city. As he  turns out the light in his room and putting his head upon the pillow  listens to the noises of the city merged now into a quiet droning roar  he thinks of the brick factory on the banks of the river in Ohio and  as he falls into sleep the face of the red-haired man lowers at him  from the factory door.

When McGregor returned to the city after the burial of his mother he  began at once to try to put his idea of the marching men into form.  For a long time he did not know how to begin. The idea was vague and  shadowy. It belonged to the nights in the hills of his own country and  seemed a little absurd when he tried to think of it in the daylight of  North State Street in Chicago.    
McGregor felt that he had to prepare himself. He believed that he  could study books and learn much from men's ideas expressed in books  without being overwhelmed by their thoughts. He became a student and  quit the place in the apple-warehouse to the secret relief of the  little bright-eyed superintendent who had never been able to get  himself up to the point of raging at this big red fellow as he had  raged at the German before McGregor's time. The warehouse man felt  that during the meeting on the corner before the saloon on the day  McGregor began to work for him something had happened. The miner's son  had unmanned him. "A man ought to be boss in his own place," he  sometimes muttered to himself, as he walked in the passageways among  rows of piled apple barrels in the upper part of the warehouse  wondering why the presence of McGregor irritated him.    
From six o'clock in the evening until two in the morning McGregor now  worked as night-cashier in a restaurant on South State Street below  Van Buren and from two until seven in the morning he slept in a room  whose windows looked down into Michigan Boulevard. On Thursday he was  free, his place being taken for the evening by the man who owned the  restaurant, a small excitable Irishman by the name of Tom O'Toole.    
McGregor got his chance to become a student through the bank account  belonging to Edith Carson. The opportunity arose in this way. On a  summer evening after his return from Pennsylvania he sat with her in  the darkened store back of the closed screen door. McGregor was morose  and silent. On the evening before he had tried to talk to several men  at the warehouse about the Marching Men and they had not understood.  He blamed his inability with words and sat in the half darkness with  his face in his hands and looked up the street saying nothing and  thinking bitter thoughts.    
The idea that had come to him made him half drunk with its  possibilities and he knew that he must not let it make him drunk. He  wanted to begin forcing men to do the simple thing full of meaning  rather than the disorganised ineffective things and he had an ever-  present inclination to arise, to stretch himself, to run into the  streets and with his great arms see if he could not sweep the people  before him, starting them on the long purposeful march that was to be  the beginning of the rebirth of the world and that was to fill with  meaning the lives of men. Then when he had walked the fever out of his  blood and had frightened the people in the streets by the grim look in  his face he tried to school himself to sit quietly waiting.    
The woman sitting beside him in a low rocking chair began trying to  tell him of something that had been in her mind. Her heart jumped and  she talked slowly, pausing between sentences to conceal the trembling  of her voice. "Would it help you in what you want to do if you could  quit at the warehouse and spend your days in study?" she asked.    
McGregor looked at her and nodded his head absent-mindedly. He thought  of the nights in his room when the hard heavy work of the day in the  warehouse seemed to have benumbed his brain.    
"Besides the business here I have seventeen hundred dollars in the  savings bank," said Edith, turning aside to conceal the eager hopeful  look in her eyes. "I want to invest it. I do not want it lying there  doing nothing. I want you to take it and make a lawyer of yourself."    
Edith sat rigid in her chair waiting for his answer. She felt that she  had put him to a test. In her mind was a new hope. "If he takes it he  will not be walking out at the door some night and never coming back."    
McGregor tried to think. He had not tried to explain to her his new  notion of life and did not know how to begin.    
"After all why not stick to my plan and be a lawyer?" he asked  himself. "That might open the door. I'll do that," he said aloud to  the woman. "Both you and mother have talked of it so I'll give it a  trial. Yes, I'll take the money."    
Again he looked at her as she sat before him flushed and eager and was  touched by her devotion as he had been touched by the devotion of the  undertaker's daughter in Coal Creek. "I don't mind being under  obligations to you," he said; "I don't know any one else I would take  it from."    
In the street later the troubled man walked about trying to make new  plans for the accomplishment of his purpose. He was annoyed by what he  thought to be the dulness of his own brain and he thrust his fist up  into the air to look at it in the lamplight. "I'll get ready to use  that intelligently," he thought; "a man wants trained brains backed up  by a big fist in the struggle I'm going into."    
It was then that the man from Ohio walked past with his hands in his  pockets and attracted his attention. To McGregor's nostrils came the  odour of rich fragrant tobacco. He turned and stood staring at the  intruder on his thoughts. "That's what I am going to fight," he  growled; "the comfortable well-to-do acceptance of a disorderly world,  the smug men who see nothing wrong with a world like this. I would  like to frighten them so that they throw their cigars away and run  about like ants when you kick over ant hills in the field."
