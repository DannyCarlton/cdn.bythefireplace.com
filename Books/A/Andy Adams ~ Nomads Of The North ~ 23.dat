  With the coming of Challoner to the cabin of Nanette Le Beau there   was no longer a shadow of gloom in the world for Miki. He did not   reason out the wonder of it, nor did he have a foreboding for the   future. It was the present in which he lived&#8212;the precious hours  in  which all the creatures he had ever loved were together. And  yet, away  back in his memory of those things that had grown deep  in his soul,  was the picture of Neewa, the bear; Neewa, his chum,  his brother, his  fighting comrade of many battles, and he thought  of the cold and  snow-smothered cavern at the top of the ridge in  which Neewa had  buried himself in that long and mysterious sleep  that was so much like  death. But it was in the present that he  lived. The hours lengthened  themselves out into days, and still  Challoner did not go, nor did  Nanette leave with the Indian for  Fort O' God. The Indian returned  with a note for MacDonnell in  which Challoner told the Factor that  something was the matter with  the baby's lungs, and that she could not  travel until the weather,  which was intensely cold, grew warmer. He  asked that the Indian be  sent back with certain supplies. 
  In spite of the terrific cold which followed the birth of the new   year Challoner had put up his tent in the edge of the timber a   hundred yards from the cabin, and Miki divided his time between  the  cabin and the tent. For him they were glorious days. And for   Challoner&#8212; 
  In a way Miki saw, though it was impossible for him to comprehend.   As the days lengthened into a week, and the week into two, there  was  something in the glow of Nanette's eyes that had never been  there  before, and in the sweetness of her voice a new thrill, and  in her  prayers at night the thankfulness of a new and great joy. 
  And then, one day, Miki looked up from where he was lying beside   the baby's crib and he saw Nanette in his master's arms, her face   turned up to him, her eyes filled with the glory of the stars, and   Challoner was saying something which transformed her face into the   face of an angel. Miki was puzzled. And he was more puzzled when   Challoner came from Nanette to the crib, and snuggled the baby up  in  his arms; and the woman&#8212;looking at them both for a moment with  that  wonderful look in her eyes&#8212;suddenly covered her face with  her hands  and sobbed. Half a snarl rose in Miki's throat, but in  that moment  Challoner had put his arm around Nanette too, and  Nanette's arms were  about him and the baby, and she was sobbing  something which for the  life of him Miki could make neither head  nor tail of. And yet he knew  that he must not snarl or spring. He  felt the wonder-thrill of the new  thing that had come into the  cabin; he gulped hard, and looked. A  moment or two later Nanette  was on her knees beside him, and her arms  were around him, just as  they had been around the man. And Challoner  was dancing like a  boy&#8212;cooing to the baby in his arms. Then he, too,  dropped down  beside Miki, and cried: 
  &quot;My Gawd! Miki&#8212;I'VE GOT A FAM'LY!&quot; 
  And Miki tried to understand. 
  That night, after supper, he saw Challoner unbraid Nanette's   glorious hair, and brush it. They laughed like two happy children.   Miki tried still harder to understand. 
  When Challoner went to go to his tent in the edge of the forest he   took Nanette in his arms, and kissed her, and stroked her shining   hair; and Nanette took his face between her hands and smiled and   almost cried in her joy. 
  After that Miki DID understand. He knew that happiness had come to   all who were in that cabin. 
  Now that his world was settled, Miki took once more to hunting.   The thrill of the trail came back to him, and wider and wider grew   his range from the cabin. Again he followed Le Beau's old  trapline.  But the traps were sprung now. He had lost a great deal  of his old  caution. He had grown fatter. He no longer scented  danger in every  whiff of the wind. It was in the third week of  Challoner's stay at the  cabin, the day which marked the end of the  cold spell and the  beginning of warm weather, that Miki came upon  an old dead-fall in a  swamp a full ten miles from the clearing. Le  Beau had set it for lynx,  but nothing had touched the bait, which  was a chunk of caribou flesh,  frozen solid as a rock. Curiously  Miki began smelling of it. He no  longer feared danger. Menace had  gone out of his world. He nibbled. He  pulled&#8212;and the log crashed  down to break his back. Only by a little  did it fail. For twenty-  four hours it held him helpless and crippled.  Then, fighting  through all those hours, he dragged himself out from  under it.  With the rising temperature a soft snow had fallen, covering  all  tracks and trails. Through this snow Miki dragged himself, leaving   a path like that of an otter in the mud, for his hind quarters  were  helpless. His back was not broken; it was temporarily  paralyzed by the  blow and the weight of the log. 
  He made in the direction of the cabin, but every foot that he   dragged himself was filled with agony, and his progress was so  slow  that at the end of an hour he had not gone more than a  quarter of a  mile. Another night found him less than two miles  from the deadfall.  He pulled himself under a shelter of brush and  lay there until dawn.  All through that day he did not move. The  next, which was the fourth  since he had left the cabin to hunt,  the pain in his back was not so  great. But he could pull himself  through the snow only a few yards at  a time. Again the good spirit  of the forests favoured him for in the  afternoon he came upon the  partly eaten carcass of a buck killed by  the wolves. The flesh was  frozen but he gnawed at it ravenously. Then  he found himself a  shelter under a mass of fallen tree-tops, and for  ten days  thereafter he lay between life and death. He would have died  had  it not been for the buck. To the carcass he managed to drag   himself, sometimes each day and sometimes every other day, and  kept  himself from starving. It was the end of the second week  before he  could stand well on his feet. The fifteenth day he  returned to the  cabin. 
  In the edge of the clearing there fell upon him slowly a   foreboding of great change. The cabin was there. It was no  different  than it had been fifteen days ago. But out of the  chimney there came  no smoke, and the windows were white with  frost. About it the snow lay  clean and white, like an unspotted  sheet. He made his way hesitatingly  across the clearing to the  door. There were no tracks. Drifted snow  was piled high over the  sill. He whined, and scratched at the door.  There was no answer.  And he heard no sound. 
  He went back into the edge of the timber, and waited. He waited   all through that day, going occasionally to the cabin, and  smelling  about it, to convince himself that he had not made a  mistake. When  darkness came he hollowed himself out a bed in the  fresh snow close to  the door and lay there all through the night.  Day came again, gray and  empty and still there was no smoke from  the chimney or sound from  within the log walls, and at last he  knew that Challoner and Nanette  and the baby were gone. But he was  hopeful. He no longer listened for  sound from within the cabin,  but watched and listened for them to come  from out of the forest.  He made short quests, hunting now on this side  and now on that of  the cabin, sniffing futilely at the fresh and  trackless snow and  pointing the wind for minutes at a time. In the  afternoon, with a  forlorn slouch to his body, he went deeper into the  forest to hunt  for a rabbit. When he had killed and eaten his supper  he returned  again and slept a second night in the burrow beside the  door. A  third day and a third night he remained, and the third night  he  heard the wolves howling under a clear and star-filled sky, and   from him there came his first cry&#8212;a yearning, grief-filled cry  that  rose wailingly out of the clearing; the entreaty for his  master, for  Nanette, and the baby. It was not an answer to the  wolves. In its note  there was a trembling fear, the voicing of a  thing that had grown into  hopelessness. 
  And now there settled upon him a loneliness greater than any   loneliness he had ever known. Something seemed to whisper to his   canine brain that all he had seen and felt had been but a dream,  and  that he was face to face with his old world again, its  dangers, its  vast and soul-breaking emptiness, its friendlessness,  its ceaseless  strife for existence. His instincts, dulled by the  worship of what the  cabin had held, became keenly alive. He sensed  again the sharp thrill  of danger, which comes of ALONENESS, and  his old caution fell upon  him, so that the fourth day he slunk  around the edge of the clearing  like a wolf. 
  The fifth night he did not sleep in the clearing but found himself   a windfall a mile back in the forest. That night he had strange  and  troubled dreams. They were not of Challoner, or of Nanette and  the  baby, nor were they of the fight and the unforgettable things  he had  seen at the Post. His dreams were of a high and barren  ridge smothered  in deep snow, and of a cavern that was dark and  deep. Again he was  with his brother and comrade of days that were  gone&#8212;Neewa the bear.  He was trying to waken him, and he could  feel the warmth of his body  and hear his sleepy, protesting  grunts. And then, later, he was  fighting again in the paradise of  black currants, and with Neewa was  running for his life from the  enraged she-bear who had invaded their  coulee. When he awoke  suddenly from out of these dreams he was  trembling and his muscles  were tense. He growled in the darkness. His  eyes were round balls  of searching fire. He whined softly and  yearningly in that pit of  gloom under the windfall, and for a moment  or two he listened, for  he thought that Neewa might answer. 
  For a month after that night he remained near the cabin. At least   once each day, and sometimes at night, he would return to the   clearing. And more and more frequently he was thinking of Neewa.   Early in March came the Tiki-Swao&#8212;(the Big Thaw). For a week the  sun  shone without a cloud in the sky. The air was warm. The snow  turned  soft underfoot and on the sunny sides of slopes and ridges  it melted  away into trickling streams or rolled down in &quot;slides&quot;  that were  miniature avalanches. The world was vibrant with a new  thrill. It  pulsed with the growing heart-beat of spring, and in  Miki's soul there  arose slowly a new hope, a new impression a new  inspiration that was  the thrilling urge of a wonderful instinct.  NEEWA WOULD BE WAKING NOW! 
  It came to him at last like a voice which he could understand. The   trickling music of the growing streams sang it to him; he heard it  in  the warm winds that were no longer filled with the blast of  winter; he  caught it in the new odours that were rising out of the  earth; he  smelled it in the dank, sweet perfume of the black  woods-soil. The  thing thrilled him. It called him. And he KNEW! 
  NEEWA WOULD BE WAKING NOW! 
  He responded to the call. It was in the nature of things that no   power less than physical force could hold him back. And yet he did   not travel as he had travelled from Challoner's camp to the cabin  of  Nanette and the baby. There had been a definite object there,   something to achieve, something to spur him on to an immediate   fulfilment. Now the thing that drew him, at first, was an   overpowering impulse, not a reality. For two or three days his  trail  westward was wandering and indefinite. Then it straightened  out, and  early in the morning of the fifth day he came from a deep  forest into  a plain, and across that plain he saw the ridge. For a  long time he  gazed over the level space before he went on. 
  In his brain the pictures of Neewa were becoming clearer and   clearer. After all, it seemed only yesterday or the day before  that  he had gone away from that ridge. Then it was smothered in  snow, and a  gray, terrible gloom had settled upon the earth. Now  there was but  little snow, and the sun was shining, and the sky  was blue again. He  went on, and sniffed along the foot of the  ridge; he had not forgotten  the way. He was not excited, because  time had ceased to have definite  import for him. Yesterday he had  come down from that ridge, and to-day  he was going back. He went  straight to the mouth of Neewa's den, which  was uncovered now, and  thrust in his head and shoulders, and sniffed.  Ah! but that lazy  rascal of a bear was a sleepy-head! He was still  sleeping. Miki  could smell him. Listening hard, he could HEAR him. 
  He climbed over the low drift of snow that had packed itself in   the neck of the cavern and entered confidently into the darkness.  He  heard a soft, sleepy grunt and a great sigh. He almost stumbled  over  Neewa, who had changed his bed. Again Neewa grunted, and Miki  whined.  He ran his muzzle into Neewa's fresh, new coat of spring  fur and  smelled his way to Neewa's ear. After all, it was only  yesterday! And  he remembered everything now! So he gave Neewa's  ear a sudden sharp  nip with his teeth, and then he barked in that  low, throaty way that  Neewa had always understood. 
  &quot;Wake up, Neewa,&quot; it all said. &quot;Wake up! The snow is gone, and   it's fine out to-day. WAKE UP!&quot; 
  And Neewa, stretching himself, gave a great yawn.
