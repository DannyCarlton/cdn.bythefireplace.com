  In that way, with the beautiful world swimming in sunshine and  golden tundra haze until foothills and mountains were like castles in a  dream, Alan Holt set off with Tautuk and Amuk Toolik, leaving Stampede  and Keok and Nawadlook at the corral bars, with Stampede little  regretting that he was left behind to guard the range. For a mighty  resolution had taken root in the prospector's heart, and he felt  himself thrilled and a bit trembling at the nearness of the greatest  drama that had ever entered his life. Alan, looking back after the  first few minutes, saw that Keok and Nawadlook stood alone. Stampede  was gone.
  The ridge beyond the coulee out of which Mary Standish had come with  wild flowers soon closed like a door between him and Sokwenna's cabin,  and the straight trail to the mountains lay ahead, and over this Alan  set the pace, with Tautuk and Amuk Toolik and a caravan of seven  pack-deer behind him, bearing supplies for the herdsmen.
  Alan had scarcely spoken to the two men. He knew the driving force  which was sending him to the mountains was not only an impulse, but  almost an inspirational thing born of necessity. Each step that he  took, with his head and heart in a swirl of intoxicating madness, was  an effort behind which he was putting a sheer weight of physical will.  He wanted to go back. The urge was upon him to surrender utterly to the  weakness of forgetting that Mary Standish was a wife. He had almost  fallen a victim to his selfishness and passion in the moment when she  stood at Nawadlook's door, telling him that she loved him. An iron hand  had drawn him out into the day, and it was the same iron hand that kept  his face to the mountains now, while in his brain her voice repeated  the words that had set his world on fire.
  He knew what had happened this morning was not the merely important  and essential incident of most human lives; it had been a cataclysmic  thing with him. Probably it would be impossible for even the girl ever  fully to understand. And he needed to be alone to gather strength and  mental calmness for the meeting of the problem ahead of him, a  complication so unexpected that the very foundation of that stoic  equanimity which the mountains had bred in him had suffered a temporary  upsetting. His happiness was almost an insanity. The dream wherein he  had wandered with a spirit of the dead had come true; it was the old  idyl in the flesh again, his father, his mother&#8212;and back in the cabin  beyond the ridge such a love had cried out to him. And he was afraid to  return. He laughed the fact aloud, happily and with an unrepressed  exultation as he strode ahead of the pack-train, and with that  exultation words came to his lips, words intended for himself alone,  telling him that Mary Standish belonged to him, and that until the end  of eternity he would fight for her and keep her. Yet he kept on, facing  the mountains, and he walked so swiftly that Tautuk and Amuk Toolik  fell steadily behind with the deer, so that in time long dips and  swells of the tundra lay between them.
  With grim persistence he kept at himself, and at last there swept  over him in its ultimate triumph a compelling sense of the justice of  what he had done&#8212;justice to Mary Standish. Even now he did not think  of her as Mary Graham. But she was Graham's wife. And if he had gone to  her in that moment of glorious confession when she had stood at  Nawadlook's door, if he had violated her faith when, because of faith,  she had laid the world at his feet, he would have fallen to the level  of John Graham himself. Thought of the narrowness of his escape and of  the first mad desire to call her back from Nawadlook's room, to hold  her in his arms again as he had held her in the cottonwoods, brought a  hot fire into his face. Something greater than his own fighting  instinct had turned him to the open door of the cabin. It was Mary  Standish&#8212;her courage, the-glory of faith and love shining in her eyes,  her measurement of him as a man. She had not been afraid to say what  was in her heart, because she knew what he would do.
  Mid-afternoon found him waiting for Tautuk and Amuk Toolik at the  edge of a slough where willows grew deep and green and the crested  billows of sedge-cotton stood knee-high. The faces of the herdsmen were  sweating. Thereafter Alan walked with them, until in that hour when the  sun had sunk to its lowest plane they came to the first of the Endicott  foothills. Here they rested until the coolness of deeper evening, when  a golden twilight filled the land, and then resumed the journey toward  the mountains.
  Midsummer heat and the winged pests of the lower lands had driven  the herds steadily into the cooler altitudes of the higher plateaux and  valleys. Here they had split into telescoping columns which drifted in  slowly moving streams wherever the doors of the hills and mountains  opened into new grazing fields, until Alan's ten thousand reindeer were  in three divisions, two of the greatest traveling westward, and one, of  a thousand head, working north and east. The first and second days Alan  remained with the nearest and southward herd. The third day he went on  with Tautuk and two pack-deer through a break in the mountains and  joined the herdsmen of the second and higher multitude of feeding  animals. There began to possess him a curious disinclination to hurry,  and this aversion grew in a direct ratio with the thought which was  becoming stronger in him with each mile and hour of his progress. A  multitude of emotions were buried under the conviction that Mary  Standish must leave the range when he returned. He had a grim sense of  honor, and a particularly devout one when it had to do with women, and  though he conceded nothing of right and justice in the relationship  which existed between the woman he loved and John Graham, he knew that  she must go. To remain at the range was the one impossible thing for  her to do. He would take her to Tanana. He would go with her to the  States. The matter would be settled in a reasonable and intelligent  way, and when he came back, he would bring her with him.
  But beneath this undercurrent of decision fought the thing which his  will held down, and yet never quite throttled completely&#8212;that  something which urged him with an unconquerable persistence to hold  with his own hands what a glorious fate had given him, and to finish  with John Graham, if it ever came to that, in the madly desirable way  he visioned for himself in those occasional moments when the fires of  temptation blazed hottest.
  The fourth night he said to Tautuk:
  &#8220;If Keok should marry another man, what would you do?&#8221;
  It was a moment before Tautuk looked at him, and in the herdsman's  eyes was a wild, mute question, as if suddenly there had leaped into  his stolid mind a suspicion which had never come to him before. Alan  laid a reassuring hand upon his arm.
  &#8220;I don't mean she's going to, Tautuk,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;She loves you. I  know it. Only you are so stupid, and so slow, and so hopeless as a  lover that she is punishing you while she has the right&#8212;before she  marries you. But if she<I> should</I> marry someone else, what would  you do?&#8221;
  &#8220;My brother?&#8221; asked Tautuk.
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  &#8220;A relative?&#8221;
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  &#8220;A friend?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. A stranger. Someone who had injured you, for instance; someone  Keok hated, and who had cheated her into marrying him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I would kill him,&#8221; said Tautuk quietly.
  It was this night the temptation was strongest upon Alan. Why should  Mary Standish go back, he asked himself. She had surrendered everything  to escape from the horror down there. She had given up fortune and  friends. She had scattered convention to the four winds, had gambled  her life in the hazard, and in the end had come to him! Why should he  not keep her? John Graham and the world believed she was dead. And he  was master here. If&#8212;some day&#8212;Graham should happen to cross his path,  he would settle the matter in Tautuk's way. Later, while Tautuk slept,  and the world lay about him in a soft glow, and the valley below was  filled with misty billows of twilight out of which came to him faintly  the curious, crackling sound of reindeer hoofs and the grunting  contentment of the feeding herd, the reaction came, as he had known it  would come in the end.
  The morning of the fifth day he set out alone for the eastward herd,  and on the sixth overtook Tatpan and his herdsmen. Tatpan, like  Sokwenna's foster-children, Keok and Nawadlook, had a quarter-strain of  white in him, and when Alan came up to him in the edge of the valley  where the deer were grazing, he was lying on a rock, playing Yankee  Doodle on a mouth-organ. It was Tatpan who told him that an hour or two  before an exhausted stranger had come into camp, looking for him, and  that the man was asleep now, apparently more dead than alive, but had  given instructions to be awakened at the end of two hours, and not a  minute later. Together they had a look at him.
  He was a small, ruddy-faced man with carroty blond hair and a  peculiarly boyish appearance as he lay doubled up like a jack-knife,  profoundly asleep. Tatpan looked at his big, silver watch and in a low  voice described how the stranger had stumbled into camp, so tired he  could scarcely put one foot ahead of the other; and that he had dropped  down where he now lay when he learned Alan was with one of the other  herds.
  &#8220;He must have come a long distance,&#8221; said Tatpan, &#8220;and he has  traveled fast.&#8221;
  Something familiar about the man grew upon Alan. Yet he could not  place him. He wore a gun, which he had unbelted and placed within reach  of his hand on the grass. His chin was pugnaciously prominent, and in  sleep the mysterious stranger had crooked a forefinger and thumb about  his revolver in a way that spoke of caution and experience.
  &#8220;If he is in such a hurry to see me, you might awaken him,&#8221; said  Alan.
  He turned a little aside and knelt to drink at a tiny stream of  water that ran down from the snowy summits, and he could hear Tatpan  rousing the stranger. By the time he had finished drinking and faced  about, the little man with the carroty-blond hair was on his feet. Alan  stared, and the little man grinned. His ruddy cheeks grew pinker. His  blue eyes twinkled, and in what seemed to be a moment of embarrassment  he gave his gun a sudden snap that drew an exclamation of amazement  from Alan. Only one man in the world had he ever seen throw a gun into  its holster like that. A sickly grin began to spread over his own  countenance, and all at once Tatpan's eyes began to bulge.
  &#8220;Stampede!&#8221; he cried.
  Stampede rubbed a hand over his smooth, prominent chin and nodded  apologetically.
  &#8220;It's me,&#8221; he conceded. &#8220;I had to do it. It was give one or t'other  up&#8212;my whiskers<I> or her</I>. They went hard, too. I flipped dice, an'  the whiskers won. I cut cards, an' the whiskers won. I played Klondike  ag'in' 'em, an' the whiskers busted the bank. Then I got mad an' shaved  'em. Do I look so bad, Alan?&#8221;
  &#8220;You look twenty years younger,&#8221; declared Alan, stifling his desire  to laugh when he saw the other's seriousness.
  Stampede was thoughtfully stroking his chin. &#8220;Then why the devil did  they laugh!&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Mary Standish didn't laugh. She cried. Just  stood an' cried, an' then sat down an' cried, she thought I was that  blamed funny! And Keok laughed until she was sick an' had to go to bed.  That little devil of a Keok calls me Pinkey now, and Miss Standish says  it wasn't because I was funny that she laughed, but that the change in  me was so sudden she couldn't help it. Nawadlook says I've got a  character-ful chin&#8212;&#8221;
  Alan gripped his hand, and a swift change came over Stampede's face.  A steely glitter shot into the blue of his eyes, and his chin hardened.  Nature no longer disguised the Stampede Smith of other days, and Alan  felt a new thrill and a new regard for the man whose hand he held.  This, at last, was the man whose name had gone before him up and down  the old trails; the man whose cool and calculating courage, whose  fearlessness of death and quickness with the gun had written pages in  Alaskan history which would never be forgotten. Where his first impulse  had been to laugh, he now felt the grim thrill and admiration of men of  other days, who, when in Stampede's presence, knew they were in the  presence of a master. The old Stampede had come to life again. And Alan  knew why. The grip of his hand tightened, and Stampede returned it.
  &#8220;Some day, if we're lucky, there always comes a woman to make the  world worth living in, Stampede,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;There does,&#8221; replied Stampede.
  He looked steadily at Alan.
  &#8220;And I take it you love Mary Standish,&#8221; he added, &#8220;and that you'd  fight for her if you had to.&#8221;
  &#8220;I would,&#8221; said Alan.
  &#8220;Then it's time you were traveling,&#8221; advised Stampede significantly.  &#8220;I've been twelve hours on the trail without a rest. She told me to  move fast, and I've moved. I mean Mary Standish. She said it was almost  a matter of life and death that I find you in a hurry. I wanted to  stay, but she wouldn't let me. It's<I> you</I> she wants. Rossland is  at the range.&#8221;
  &#8220;<I>Rossland</I>!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, Rossland. And it's my guess John Graham isn't far away. I  smell happenings, Alan. We'd better hurry.&#8221;
