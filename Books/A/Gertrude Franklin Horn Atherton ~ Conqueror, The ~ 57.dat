Hamilton folded and sealed the letter, then determined to take it to the  post-office himself. The night was hot and his head was throbbing: he  had worked, dined, wined, talked, and written, since eight in the  morning, with no interval for fresh air or exercise. He was not tired,  but very nervous, and after he had disposed of his letter, he set off  for a stroll along the river front, and walked for two miles up the  quiet road on the east side, listening to the lap of the water, and  pausing to watch the superb effect of the moonlight on the bright  ripples and on the wooded heights of Long Island. The little village of  Brooklyn twinkled here and there for a time, then lay like a sombre  shadow in the silences of her forest. As he returned, there was not a  light anywhere, except now and again at a masthead, for it was very  late. The clock in Trinity steeple struck one as he reentered the town.  He moved through the narrow dark and crooked streets with a lagging  step, although he had walked briskly for the past hour. There seemed to  be no sleep in him, and the idea of his quiet room was an irritation.    
"That woman is on my nerves," he thought. "I've written a letter  to-night that may bridge this country over another crisis, and I should  be sleeping the sleep of the self-sufficient statesman, or at least  excogitating upon weighty matters; and for the last hour I've given no  thought to anything but an unknown woman, who has electrified my  imagination and my passions. Is there, perhaps, more safety in meeting  her and laying the ghost? Imagination plays us such damnable tricks. She  may have a raucous voice, or too sharp a wit; or she may love another by  this. I'll ask Nick to take me there to-morrow."    
The drawing-room windows of the dwellings were but a few feet above the  ground, and many of them abutted on the pavement. The narrow street was  almost dark, in spite of the moonlight, but Hamilton saw that some one  sat at a lower window but a few feet ahead of him. It was a woman, for  her arm hung over the sill There was nothing to arrest his attention in  the circumstance, beyond the vague beauty of the arm and hand, for on  these dog nights many sat at their windows until the chill of early  morning; but he suddenly remembered that he was in Pearl Street. For a  moment he meditated retreat; with no enthusiasm, however. He shrugged  his shoulders and walked on, but his breath was short. As he approached  he could see that she was watching him, although her face was almost  invisible. He paused beneath the window, half in defiance, his eyes  striving to pierce the heavy shade of the room. The hand closed abruptly  about the lower part of his face. It trembled, but there was as much  determination as warmth in the finger tips; and he seemed to have been  transported suddenly to a field of violets.
