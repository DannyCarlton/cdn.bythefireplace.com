A fortnight later, one sultry afternoon, Granville Kelmscott found  himself, after various strange adventures and escapes by the way,  in a Koranna hut, far in the untravelled heart of the savage Barolong  country.    
The tenement where he sat, or more precisely squatted, was by  no means either a commodious or sweet-scented one. Yet it was the  biggest of a group on the river-bank, some five feet high from  floor to roof, so that a Kelmscott couldn't possibly stand erect  at full length in it; and it was roughly round in shape, like an  overgrown beehive, the framework consisting of branches of trees,  arranged in a rude circle, over whose arching ribs native rush  mats had been thrown or sewn with irregular order. The door was a  hole, through which the proud descendant of the squires of Tilgate  had to creep on all fours; a hollow pit dug out in the centre served  as the only fireplace; smoke and stagnant air formed the staples  of the atmosphere. A more squalid hovel Granville Kelmscott had  never even conceived as possible. It was as dirty and as loathsome  as the most vivid imagination could picture the hut of the lowest  savages.    
Yet here that delicately nurtured English gentleman was to be  cooped up for an indefinite time, as it seemed, by order of the  black despot who ruled over the Barolong with a rod of iron.    
What had led Granville Kelmscott into this extraordinary scrape  it would not be hard to say. The Kelmscott nature, in all  its embodiments, worked on very simple but very fixed lines. The  moment Granville saw his half-brother Guy at Dutoitspan, his mind  was made up at once as to his immediate procedure. He wouldn't stop  one day--one hour longer than necessary where he could see that  fellow who committed the murder. Come what might, he would make  his escape at once into the far interior.    
As before in England, so now in Africa, both brothers were moved by  the self-same impulses. And each carried them out with characteristic  promptitude.    
Where could Granville go, however? Well, it was rumoured at  Dutoitspan that "pebbles" had been found far away to the north in  the Barolong country. "Pebbles," of course, is good South African  for diamonds; and at this welcome news all Kimberley and Griqualand  pricked up their ears with congenial delight; for business was  growing flat on the old-established diamond fields. The palmy era  of great finds and lucky hits was now long past; the day of systematic  and prosaic industry had set in instead for the over-stocked  diggings. It was no longer possible for the luckiest fresh hand  to pick up pebbles lying loose on the surface; the mode of working  had become highly skilled and scientific.    
Machines and scaffolds, and washing-cradles and lifting apparatus  were now required to make the business a success; the simple old  gambling element was rapidly going out, and the capitalist was rapidly  coming up in its stead as master of the situation. So Granville  Kelmscott, being an enterprising young man, though destitute of  cash, and utterly ignorant of South African life, determined to  push on with all his might and main into the Barolong country, and  to rush for the front among the first in the field in these rumoured  new diggings on the extreme north frontier of civilization.    
He started alone, as a Kelmscott might do, and made his way  adventurously, without any knowledge of the Koranna language or  manners, through many wild villages of King Khatsua's dominions.  Night after night he camped out in the open; and day after day  he tramped on by himself, buying food as he went from the natives  for English silver, in search of precious stones, over that dreary  tableland. At last, on the fourteenth day, in a deep alluvial  hollow near a squalid group of small Barolong huts, he saw a tiny  round stone, much rubbed and water-worn, which he picked up and  examined with no little curiosity. The two days he had spent at  Dutoitspan had not been wasted. He had learnt to recognise the look  of the native gem. Once glance told him at once what his pebble  was. He recognised it at sight as one of those small but much-valued  diamonds of the finest water, which diggers know by the technical  name of "glass-stones."    
The hollow where he stood was in fact an ancient alluvial pit or  volcanic mud-crater. Scoriac rubble filled it in to a very great  depth; and in the interstices of this rubble were embedded here  and there rude blocks of greenstone, containing almond-shaped  chalcedonies and agate and milk-quartz, with now and then a tiny  water-worn spec which an experienced eye would have detected at  once as the finest "riverstones."    
Here indeed was a prize! The solitary Englishman recognised in a  second that he was the first pioneer of a new and richer Kimberley.    
But as Granville Kelmscott stood still, looking hard at his find  through the little pocket-lens he had brought with him from England,  with a justifiable tremor of delight at the pleasant thought that  here, perhaps, he had lighted on the key to something which might  restore him once more to his proper place at Tilgate, he was suddenly  roused from his delightful reverie by a harsh negro voice, shrill  and clear, close behind him, saying, in very tolerable African-English--    
"Hillo, you white man! what dat you got there? You come here to  Barolong land, so go look for diamond?"    
Granville turned sharply round, and saw standing by his side a  naked and stalwart black man, smiling blandly at his discovery with  broad negro amusement.    
"It's a pebble," the Englishman said, pocketing it as carelessly as  he could, and trying to look unconcerned, for his new acquaintance  held a long native spear in his stout left hand, and looked by no  means the sort of person to be lightly trifled with.    
"Oh, dat a pebble, mistah white man!" the Barolong said sarcastically,  holding out his black right hand with a very imperious air. "Den  you please hand him over dat pebble you find. Me got me orders.  King Khatsua no want any diamond digging in Barolong land."    
Granville tried to parley with the categorical native; but his  attempts at palaver were eminently unsuccessful. The naked black  man was master of the situation.    
"You hand over dat stone, me friend," he said, assuming a menacing  attitude, and holding out his hand once more with no very gentle  air, "or me run you trew de body wit me assegai--just so! King  Khatsua, him no want any diamond diggings in Barolong land."    
And, indeed, Granville Kelmscott couldn't help admitting to himself,  when he came to think of it, that King Khatsua was acting wisely in  his generation. For the introduction of diggers into his dominions  would surely have meant, as everywhere else, the speedy proclamation  of a British protectorate, and the final annihilation of King  Khatsua himself and his dusky fellow-countrymen.    
There is nothing, to say the truth, the South African native dreads  so much as being "eaten up," as he calls it, by those aggressive  English. King Khatsua knew his one chance in life consisted in  keeping the diggers firmly out of his dominions; and he was prepared  to deny the very existence of diamonds throughout the whole of  Barolong land, until the English, by sheer force, should come in  flocks and unearth them.    
In obedience to his chief's command, therefore, the naked henchman  still held out his hand menacingly.    
"Dis land King Khatsua's," he repeated once more, in an angry  voice. "All diamonds found on it belong to King Khatsua. Just you  hand dat over. No steal; no tief-ee."    
The instincts of the land-owning class were too strong in Granville  Kelmscott not to make him admit at once to himself the justice of  this claim. The owner of the soil had a right to the diamonds. He  handed over the stone with a pang of regret. The savage grinned to  himself, and scanned it attentively. Then extending his spear, as  one might do to a cow or a sheep, he drove Granville before him.    
"You come along a' me," he said shortly, in a most determined voice.  "You come along a' me. King Khatsua's orders."    
Granville went before him without one word of remonstrance, much  wondering what was likely to happen next, till he found himself  suddenly driven into that noisome hut, where he was forced to enter  ignominiously on all fours, like an eight months' old baby.    
By the light of the fire that burned dimly in the midst of his  captor's house he could see, as his eyes grew gradually accustomed  to the murky gloom, a strange and savage scene, such as he had never  before in his life dreamt of. In the pit of the hut some embers  glowed feebly, from whose midst a fleecy object was sputtering and  hissing. A second glance assured him that the savoury morsel was  the head of an antelope in process of roasting. Two greasy black  women, naked to the waist, were superintending this primitive  cookery; all round, a group of unclad little imps, as black as their  mothers, lounged idly about, with their eyes firmly fixed on the  chance of dinner. As Granville entered, the husband and father,  poking in his head, shouted a few words after him. Another native  outside kept watch and ward with a spear at the door meanwhile, to  prevent his escape against King Khatsua's orders.    
For two long hours the Englishman waited there, fretting and fuming,  in that stifling atmosphere. Meanwhile, the antelope's head was  fully cooked, and the women and children falling on it like wild  beasts, tore off the scorched fleece and snatched the charred flesh  from the bones with their fingers greedily. It was a hideous sight;  it sickened him to see it.    
By--and--by Granville heard a loud voice outside. He listened  in surprise. It sounded as though Barolong had another prisoner.  There was a pause and a scuffle. Then, all of a sudden, somebody  else came bundling unceremoniously through the hole that served for  a door, in the same undignified fashion as he himself had done.  Granville's eyes, now accustomed to the gloom, recognised the  stranger at once with a thrill of astonishment. He could hardly  trust his senses at the sight. It was--no, it couldn't be--yes, it  was--Guy Waring.    
Guy Waring, sure enough; as before, they were companions. The  Kelmscott character had worked itself out exactly alike in each  of them. They had come independently by the self-same road to the  rumoured diamond fields of the Barolong country.    
It was some minutes, however, before Guy, for his part, recognised  his fellow-prisoner in the dark and gloomy hut. Then each stared  at the other in mute surprise. They found no words to speak their  mutual astonishment. This was more wonderful, to be sure, than even  either of their former encounters.    
For another long hour the two unfriendly English-men huddled away  from one another in opposite corners of that native hut, without  speaking a word of any sort in their present straits. At the end  of that time, a voice spoke at the door some guttural sentences  in the Barolong language. The natives inside responded alike in  their own savage clicks. Next the voice spoke in English; it was  Granville's captor, he now knew well.    
"White men, you come out; King Khatsua himself, him go to 'peak to  you."    
They crawled out, one at a time, in sorry guise, through the narrow  hole. It was a pitiful exhibition. Were it not for the danger and  uncertainty of the event, they could almost themselves have fairly  laughed at it. King Khatsua stood before them, a tall, full-blooded  black, in European costume, with a round felt hat and a crimson tie,  surrounded by his naked wives and attendants. In his outstretched  hand he held before their faces two incriminating diamonds. He spoke  to them with much dignity at considerable length in the Barolong  tongue, to a running accompaniment of laudatory exclamations--"Oh,  my King! Oh, wise words!"--from the mouths of his courtiers. Neither  Granville nor Guy understood, of course, a single syllable of the  stately address; but that didn't in the least disturb the composure  of the dusky monarch. He went right through to the end with his  solemn warning, scolding them both roundly, as they guessed, in his  native tongue, like a master reproving a pair of naughty schoolboys.    
As he finished, their captor stood forth with great importance  to act as interpreter. He had been to the Kimberly diamond mines  himself as a labourer, and was therefore accounted by his own people  a perfect model of English scholarship.    
"King Khatsua say this," he observed curtly. "You very bad men;  you come to Barolong land. King Khatsua say, Barolong land for  Barolong. No allow white man dig here for diamonds. If white man  come, him eat up Barolong. Keep white man out; keep land for King  Khatsua."    
"Does King Khatsua want us to leave his country, then?" Granville  Kelmscott asked, with a distinct tremor in his voice, for the great  chief and his followers looked decidedly hostile.    
The interpreter threw back his head and laughed a loud long laugh.    
"King Khatsua not a fool!" he answered at last, after a rhetorical  pause. "King Khatsua no want to give up his land to white man.  If you two white man go back to Kimberley, you tell plenty other  people, 'Diamonds in Barolong land.' You say, 'Come along o' me  to Barolong land with gun; we show you where to dig 'um!' No, no,  King Khatsua not a fool. King Khatsua say this. You two white man  no go back to Kimberley. You spies. You stop here plenty time along  o' King Khatsua. Never go back, till King Khatsua give leave. So  no let any other white man come along into Barolong land."    
Granville looked at Guy, and Guy looked at Granville. In this  last extremity, before those domineering blacks, they almost forgot  everything, save that they were both English. What were they to do  now? The situation was becoming truly terrible.    
The interpreter went on once more, however, with genuine savage  enjoyment of the consternation he was causing them.    
"King Khatsua say this," he continued, in a very amused tone. "You  stop here plenty days, very good, in Barolong land. King Khatsua  give you hut; King Khatsua give you claim; Barolong man bring spear  and guard you. No do you any harm for fear of Governor. Governor keep  plenty guns in Cape Town. You two white man live in hut together,  dig diamonds together; get plenty pebbles. Keep one diamond you  find for yourself; give one diamond after that to King Khatsua.  Barolong man bring you plenty food, plenty drink, but no let you  go back. You try to go, then Barolong man spear you."    
The playful dig with which the savage thrust forward his assegai  at that final remark showed Granville Kelmscott in a moment this  was no idle threat. It was clear for the present they must accept  the inevitable. They must remain in Barolong land; and he must  share hut and work with that doubly hateful creature--the man who  had deprived him of his patrimony at Tilgate, and whom he firmly  believed to be the murderer of Montague Nevitt. This was what  had come then of his journey to Africa! Truly, adversity makes us  acquainted with strange bedfellows!
