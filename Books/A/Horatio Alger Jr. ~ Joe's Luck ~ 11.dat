  At the isthmus they exchanged steamers, crossing the narrow neck of  land on the backs of mules. To-day the journey is more rapidly and  comfortably made in a railroad-car. Of the voyage on the Pacific  nothing need be said. The weather was fair, and it was uneventful.
  It was a beautiful morning in early September when they came in  sight of the Golden Gate, and, entering the more placid waters of San  Francisco Bay, moored at a short distance from the town.
  &#8220;What do you think of it, Joe?&#8221; asked Charles Folsom.
  &#8220;I don't know,&#8221; said Joe slowly. &#8220;Is this really San Francisco?&#8221;
  &#8220;It is really San Francisco.&#8221;
  &#8220;It doesn't seem to be much built up yet,&#8221; said Joe.
  In fact, the appearance of the town would hardly suggest the stately  capital of to-day, which looks out like a queen on the bay and the  ocean, and on either side opens her arms to the Eastern and Western  continents. It was a town of tents and one-story cabins, irregularly  and picturesquely scattered over the hillside, with here and there a  sawmill, where now stand some of the most prominent buildings of the  modern city. For years later there was a large mound of sand where now  the stately Palace Hotel covers two and a half acres. Where now stand  substantial business blocks, a quarter of a century since there  appeared only sandy beaches or mud-flats, with here and there a wooden  pier reaching out into the bay. Only five years before the town  contained but seventy-nine buildings&#8212;thirty-one frame, twenty-six  adobe, and the rest shanties. It had grown largely since then, but even  now was only a straggling village, with the air of recent settlement.
  &#8220;You expected something more, Joe, didn't you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; admitted Joe.
  &#8220;You must remember how new it is. Ten years, nay, five, will work a  great change in this straggling village. We shall probably live to see  it a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants.&#8221;
  The passengers were eager to land. They were tired of the long  voyage and anxious to get on shore. They wanted to begin making their  fortunes.
  &#8220;What are your plans, Joe?&#8221; asked Charles Folsom.
  &#8220;I shall accept the first job that offers,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I can't  afford to remain idle long with my small capital.&#8221;
  &#8220;Joe,&#8221; said the young man seriously, &#8220;let me increase your capital  for you. You can pay me back, you know, when it is convenient. Here,  take this gold piece.&#8221;
  Our young hero shook his head.
  &#8220;Thank you, Mr. Folsom,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you are very kind, but I think it  will be better for me to shift on what I have. Then I shall have to go  to work at once, and shall get started in my new career.&#8221;
  &#8220;Suppose you can't find work?&#8221; suggested Folsom.
  &#8220;I will find it,&#8221; said Joe resolutely.
  &#8220;Perhaps we might take lodgings together, Joe.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't afford it,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;You're a gentleman of property, and  I'm a poor boy who has his fortune to make. For the present I must  expect to rough it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, Joe, perhaps you are right. At any rate, I admire your pluck  and independent spirit.&#8221;
  There was a motley crowd collected on the pier and on the beach when  Joe and his friend landed. Rough, bearded men, in Mexican sombreros and  coarse attire&#8212;many in shirt-sleeves and with their pantaloons tucked  in their boots&#8212;watched the new arrivals with interest.
  &#8220;You needn't feel ashamed of your clothes, Joe,&#8221; said Folsom, with a  smile. &#8220;You are better dressed than the majority of those we see.&#8221;
  Joe looked puzzled.
  &#8220;They don't look as if they had made their fortunes,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Don't judge by appearances. In a new country people are careless of  appearances. Some of these rough fellows, no doubt, have their pockets  full of gold.&#8221;
  At this moment a rough-looking fellow stepped forward and said  heartily:
  &#8220;Isn't this Charles Folsom?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Folsom, puzzled.
  &#8220;You don't remember me?&#8221; said the other, laughing.
  &#8220;Not I.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not remember Harry Carter, your old chum?&#8221;
  &#8220;Good Heaven!&#8221; exclaimed Folsom, surveying anew the rough figure  before him. &#8220;You don't mean to say you are Harry Carter?&#8221;
  &#8220;The same, at your service.&#8221;
  &#8220;What a transformation! Why, you used to be rather a swell and  now&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Now I look like a barbarian.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, rather,&#8221; said Folsom, laughing.
  &#8220;You want me to explain? Such toggery as I used to wear would be the  height of folly at the mines.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope you have had good luck,&#8221; said Folsom.
  &#8220;Pretty fair,&#8221; said Carter, in a tone of satisfaction. &#8220;My pile has  reached five thousand dollars.&#8221;
  &#8220;And how long have you been at work?&#8221;
  &#8220;A year. I was a bookkeeper in New York on a salary of fifteen  hundred dollars a year. I used to spend all my income&#8212;the more fool  I&#8212;till the last six months, when I laid by enough to bring me out  here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you have really bettered yourself?&#8221;
  &#8220;I should say so. I could only save up five hundred dollars a year  at the best in New York. Here I have crowded ten years into one.&#8221;
  &#8220;In spite of your large outlay for clothes?&#8221;
  &#8220;I see you will have your joke. Now, what brings you out here? Are  you going to the mines?&#8221;
  &#8220;Presently, but not to dig. I came to survey the country.&#8221;
  &#8220;Let me do what I can for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I will. First, what hotel shall I go to?&#8221;
  &#8220;There is the Leidesdorff House, on California Street. I'll lead you  there.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you. Will you come, Joe?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I will go to find out where it is.&#8221;
  The three bent their steps to the hotel referred to. It was a shanty  compared with the magnificent hotels which now open their portals to  strangers, but the charge was ten dollars a day and the fare was of the  plainest.
  &#8220;I guess I won't stop here,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;My money wouldn't keep me  here more than an hour or two.&#8221;
  &#8220;At any rate, Joe, you must dine with me,&#8221; said Folsom. &#8220;Then you  may start out for yourself.&#8221;
  &#8220;You must dine with me, both of you,&#8221; said Carter.
  Folsom saw that he was in earnest, and accepted.
  The dinner was plain but abundant, and all three did justice to it.  Joe did not know till afterward that the dinner cost five dollars  apiece.
  After dinner the two friends sat down to talk over old times and  mutual friends, but Joe felt that there was no time for him to lose. He  had his fortune to make. Still more important, he had his living to  make, and in a place where dollars were held as cheap as dimes in New  York or Boston.
  So, emerging into the street, with his small bundle under his arm,  he bent his steps as chance directed.
