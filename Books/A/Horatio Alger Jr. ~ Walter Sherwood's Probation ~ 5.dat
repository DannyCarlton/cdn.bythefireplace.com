  Walter's announcement, recorded at the close of the preceding  chapter,  fell like a thunderbolt on his room-mate. 
  &quot;You have lost your money?&quot; repeated Gates, in a tone of  incredulity.  &quot;You don't mean it!&quot; 
  &quot;Read that letter, Gates,&quot; said Walter, pushing it over to his  chum. 
  The letter was, of course, from Doctor Mack, and ran thus: 
  &quot;DEAR WALTER: Your letter asking for an extra check for one hundred   dollars came to hand three or four days since. I have delayed   answering for two reasons. I am satisfied that you are spending more   money than is necessary, and, moreover, I have shrunk from   communicating to you some unpleasant intelligence. Upon me have   devolved the investment and management of your property, and while I   have tried to be cautious, there have been losses which I regret. In   one case three-fourths of an investment has been lost. Of course, you   didn't know this, or you would have been less free in your   expenditures. 
  &quot;I am not prepared to tell you how you stand. I think it will be   prudent for you to leave college at the end of this term, and for a   year to seek some employment. During that time I will do what I can to   settle matters on a better footing, and perhaps at the end of that   time you will be able to return to your studies. You are so young&#8212;I   think you must be younger than the majority of your classmates&#8212;that   you can afford to lose the time. 
  &quot;I send you a check for sixty dollars in place of a hundred. I wish   you to have your regular term bills sent to me, and I will forward   checks in payment. I will see that you leave Euclid owing no man   anything. When you come home for the vacation we can consult as to the   future. I hope you will not be much depressed or cast down by the news   I send. Your money is not all lost, and I may be able, in the course   of twelve months, to recover in a large measure what has been sunk. 
  &quot;Your affectionate guardian, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EZEKIEL MACK.&quot; 
  &quot;A regular sockdolager, isn't it, Gates?&quot; said Walter. 
  &quot;I don't see that it's so bad,&quot; answered Gates slowly. &quot;Your money   isn't all lost.&quot; 
  &quot;But I must leave college.&quot; 
  &quot;True; but, as your guardian says, you are young, and if you come  back  at the end of a year you will still be a year younger than I for  your  standing. Of course, I am sorry to have you go.&quot; 
  &quot;I am sure of that, Gates.&quot; 
  &quot;Is the prospect of working for a year so unpleasant to you,  Walter?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I can't say it is,&quot; said Walter, brightening up, &quot;not if I can   choose my employment. I shouldn't like to go behind the counter in a   grocery store, or&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Black boots for a living?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, hardly,&quot; said Walter, laughing. 
  &quot;Probably your guardian will consult your preferences.&quot; 
  &quot;I wish I could arrange to travel. I should like to see something  of  the world.&quot; 
  &quot;Why not? You might get an agency of some kind. One college  vacation&#8212;  last summer&#8212;I traveled about as book agent.&quot; 
  &quot;How did you like it?&quot; 
  &quot;Not very much. I met with a good many rebuffs, and was  occasionally  looked upon with suspicion, as I could see. Still, I made  a living,  and brought back thirty dollars to start me on my new term.&quot; 
  &quot;Just what my supper cost the other evening.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I didn't think it wise to spend the money in the same way.&quot; 
  &quot;You have cheered me up, Gates. I really believe I shall like to  spend  a year in some kind of business.&quot; 
  &quot;Write your guardian to that effect. He may be blaming himself for  his  agency in your misfortune, and a cheerful letter from you will   brighten him up.&quot; 
  &quot;All right! I will.&quot; 
  Walter sat down and dashed off the following note: 
  &quot;DEAR GUARDIAN: Your letter just received. I won't pretend that I  am  not sorry for the loss of my money, but I am sure that you acted  for  the best. Don't trouble yourself too much about the matter.  Perhaps it  will all come out right in a year or so. In the meantime I  think I  shall find it not unpleasant to work for a year if you will  let me  select the kind of business I am to follow. 
  &quot;I will make the money you sent me do for the present, and will  send  you my term bills as you desire. You can depend upon my settling  up as  cheap as possible, though I confess I have not hitherto been  nearly as  economical as I might have been. Now that I know it is  necessary, you  shall have no reason to complain of me. 
  &quot;Your affectionate ward, <BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WALTER SHERWOOD.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you think of that, Gates?&quot; asked Walter, giving the letter  to  his chum to read. 
  &quot;Excellent! It shows the right spirit.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad you think so.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you know, Walter, I think I have more occasion for regret than   you? I must bid farewell to my room-mate and this pleasant room.&quot; 
  &quot;To your room-mate, yes, but not necessarily to the room.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall have to furnish it in very different style for the  present. I  am not sure that I can afford a carpet. The luxury of my  present  surroundings, I am afraid, will spoil me for humble quarters.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't borrow any trouble about that. I shall leave you the  furniture  as it stands, and when I come back to college, even if we  are in  different classes, you must take me in again.&quot; 
  &quot;Of course I will agree to an arrangement so much in my favor, but   perhaps your guardian will think you had better sell the furniture and   realize what you can.&quot; 
  &quot;No, I am sure he won't. There's nothing mean about Doctor Mack.  You  can take in any one you please in my place, only I am to come back  at  the end of a year if things turn out well.&quot; 
  &quot;I heartily hope you will come back, and if you will excuse my  saying  so, with a more earnest spirit, and a determination to do  justice to  your really excellent talents.&quot; 
  &quot;Good advice! I'll adopt it. I'll begin to do better at once. I was   intending to take a drive this evening, but it would cost me two   dollars, and I will stay at home and save the money.&quot; 
  &quot;Come with me on a walk, instead.&quot; 
  &quot;I will.&quot; 
  &quot;We will go to the top of Mount Legar. At sunset there will be a  fine  view from there.&quot; 
  &quot;I must stop on the way and pay Mr. Daniels what I owe him. He will   lose a good deal by my going away.&quot; 
  &quot;True; but his loss will be your gain.&quot; 
  At the outset of their walk the two students called at the hotel,  and  found Mr. Daniels on the piazza. 
  &quot;Glad to see you, Mr. Sherwood,&quot; said the landlord briskly. 
  &quot;I think you will be, Mr. Daniels, for I have come to pay your  bills.&quot; 
  &quot;Money is always welcome, Mr. Sherwood. You have no idea how much I   lose by trusting students. There was Green, of the last graduating   class, left college owing me forty-five dollars. He has gone West   somewhere, and I never expect to get a cent of my money.&quot; 
  &quot;You came pretty near losing by me, Daniels.&quot; 
  &quot;How is that?&quot; queried the landlord, looking surprised. 
  &quot;I've lost a lot of money, or my guardian has for me, and I've got  to  leave college at the end of this term.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't say so!&quot; ejaculated Mr. Daniels regretfully. 
  &quot;It's all true. My guardian wrote me about it this morning.&quot; 
  &quot;I suppose you're a good deal cut up about it, Mr. Sherwood.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I was at first, but I may be able to come back after a year  or  two. I shall go into some business, and meanwhile my guardian will  do  what he can to recover the money lost. It isn't so bad, after all.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be sorry to have you go, Mr. Sherwood.&quot; 
  &quot;You will miss my bills, at any rate. I wouldn't have given that   supper the other evening if I had known how things stood. I would have   put the thirty dollars to better use.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, you've paid up like a gentleman, anyway. I hope you'll come   back in a year as rich as ever. You wanted a team to-night, James told   me.&quot; 
  &quot;That was before I got my guardian's letter. I shall walk, instead  of  taking a carriage-ride.&quot; 
  &quot;I will let the account stand, if you wish.&quot; 
  &quot;No. I can't afford to run up any bills. Good night, Mr. Daniels.&quot; 
  &quot;You did right, Walter,&quot; said Gates. &quot;It is a bad thing to run up   bills.&quot; 
  &quot;Especially when you are poor. It seems odd to be poor.&quot; 
  &quot;I am used to it, Walter. You don't seem very sad over it.&quot; 
  &quot;I am not. That is what puzzles me. I really begin to think I like   it.&quot;
