  On the platform of the main schoolroom in the Shelby Classical   Institute stood Colonel Owen and Walter Sherwood. 
  &quot;My young friends,&quot; began Colonel Owen, &quot;you are all aware that  your  respected teacher, Mr. Haywood, is obliged to be absent for the   remainder of the term. I have been able to secure as his substitute   Mr. Walter Sherwood, who will do his best to carry on the work which   Mr. Haywood has so auspiciously commenced. I hope you will receive him   cordially and uphold him in his task.&quot; 
  Walter felt some diffidence as he realized what a responsibility  had  been placed upon him. 
  He cleared his throat and spoke a few words. 
  &quot;Colonel Owen has introduced me to you and expressed a hope in  which I  join him&#8212;that you will receive me cordially and uphold me in  my work.  I will now go about among the seats, make inquiries as to  your  progress, and arrange the classes.&quot; 
  This short speech made a favorable impression upon all the pupils  with  two exceptions. These were the largest scholars&#8212;Ben Buffum and  Enoch  Snow. What they thought of Walter may be gathered from their   conversation as they walked home together. 
  &quot;What do you think of the new master, Ben?&quot; said Enoch. 
  &quot;I s'pose he'll do. He ought to, if he's been to college; but I'll   tell you what, Enoch, it riles me to have a boy of my own age set over   me.&quot; 
  &quot;Me ditto!&quot; 
  &quot;He would do for a primary school, but when it comes to young men  like  us, I don't like to let people know that he's my teacher.&quot; 
  &quot;It's all right for the others to obey him, but you and I are just  as  strong as he, and maybe stronger.&quot; 
  &quot;I guess I could floor him in wrestling.&quot; 
  &quot;You're too much for me, Ben, and I think I can stand up to him,  and  maybe lick him.&quot; 
  &quot;It's likely you can. Now, there was Hayward&#8212;he was a big man. I   didn't mind obeying him.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you talking about Mr. Sherwood?&quot; asked Harry Howe, a boy of   fourteen. 
  &quot;No, I'm not. I'm talking about Mr. Hayward.&quot; 
  &quot;How do you like the new teacher?&quot; 
  &quot;He's only a boy. He'll have a hard row to hoe.&quot; 
  &quot;Who'll make it hard for him?&quot; 
  &quot;Enoch and I.&quot; 
  &quot;Then it will be a shame. He seems to be a perfect gentleman.&quot; 
  &quot;Gentleman! He's only a boy, like ourselves.&quot; 
  &quot;At any rate, he knows enough to teach us.&quot; 
  &quot;That may be, but he can't keep order.&quot; 
  &quot;Why can't he?&quot; 
  &quot;You'll see whether he can or not,&quot; said Ben, significantly. 
  &quot;Are you going to make trouble?&quot; 
  &quot;It isn't best for small boys to know too much.&quot; 
  Walter had not failed to notice the half-rebellious demeanor of his   two oldest pupils. Moreover, he had been warned by the janitor of the   building that they would be likely to give him trouble.
