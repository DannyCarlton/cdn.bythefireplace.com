    Philip took another walk in the afternoon, and was rather amused to   see how much attention he received. When he drew near the hotel he   was stared at by several gaping youngsters, who apparently were   stationed there for no other purpose. He overheard their whispers: 
  &quot;That's him! That's Philip de Gray, the wonderful fiddler!&quot; 
  &quot;I never suspected, when I lived at Norton, that I was so much of a   curiosity,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I wish I knew what they'll say  about  me to-morrow.&quot; 
  At six o'clock Morris Lovett called and received his ticket. 
  &quot;You'll have a big house to-night, Philip,&quot; he said. &quot;I know a lot   of fellows that are going.&quot; 
  &quot;I am glad to hear it,&quot; said Philip, well pleased, for he concluded   that if such were the case his purse would be considerably heavier   the next day. 
  &quot;It's strange how quick you've come up;&quot; said Morris. &quot;I never   expected you'd be so famous. 
  &quot;Nor I,&quot; said Philip, laughing. 
  &quot;I'd give anything if I could have my name posted round like  yours.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps you will have, some time.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, no! I couldn't play more'n a pig,&quot; said Morris decidedly.  &quot;I'll  have to be a clerk, and stick to business.&quot; 
  &quot;You'll make more money in the end that way, Morris, even if your   name isn't printed in capitals.&quot; 
  They retired into a small room adjoining the stage, to prepare for   their appearance. 
  The professor rubbed his hands in glee. 
  &quot;Did you see what a house we have, Mr. de Gray?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, professor.&quot; 
  &quot;I think there'll be a hundred dollars over and above expenses.&quot; 
  &quot;That will be splendid!&quot; said Philip, naturally elated. 
  &quot;The firm of Riccaboeca and De Gray is starting swimmingly.&quot; 
  &quot;So it is. I hope it will continue so.&quot; 
  &quot;Here is the program, Mr. de Gray. You will observe that I appear   first, in my famous soliloquy. You will follow, with the 'Carnival  of  Venice.' Do you feel agitated?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, no. I am so used to playing that I shall not feel at all   bashful.&quot; 
  &quot;That is well.&quot; 
  &quot;I would like to be on the stage, professor, to hear you.&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly. I have anticipated your desire, and provided an extra   chair.&quot; 
  The time came, and Professor Riccabocca stepped upon the stage, his   manner full of dignity, and advanced to the desk. Philip took a  chair  a little to the rear. 
  Their entrance was greeted by hearty applause. The professor made a   stately bow, and a brief introductory speech, in which he said   several things about Philip and himself which rather astonished our   hero. Then he began to recite the soliloquy. 
  Probably it was never before so amazingly recited. Professor   Riccabocca's gestures, facial contortions, and inflections were very   remarkable. Philip almost suspected that he was essaying a burlesque   role. 
  The mature portion of the audience were evidently puzzled, but the   small boys were delighted, and with some of the young men, stamped   vigorously at the close. 
  Professor Riccabocea bowed modestly, and said: 
  &quot;Gentlemen and ladies, you will now have the pleasure of listening   to the young and talented Philip de Gray, the wonderful  boy-musician,  in his unrivaled rendition of the 'Carnival of  Venice.'&quot; 
  Philip rose, coloring a little with shame a I this high-flown   introduction, and came forward. 
  All applauded heartily, for sympathy is always felt for a young   performer, especially when he has a manly bearing and an attractive   face, such as our hero possessed. 
  Philip was determined to do his best. Indeed, after being  advertised  and announced as a boy wonder, he felt that he could not do   otherwise. 
  He commenced, and soon lost himself in the music he loved so well,   so that before he had half finished he had quite forgotten his   audience, and half started at the boisterous applause which  followed.  He bowed his acknowledgments, but found this would not do. 
  He was forced to play it a second time, greatly to the apparent   satisfaction of the audience. It was clear that, whatever might be   thought of Professor Riccabocea's recitation, the young violinist  had  not disappointed his audience. 
  Philip could see, in a seat near the stage, the beaming face of his   friend Morris Lovett, who was delighted at the success of his old   acquaintance, and anticipated the reflected glory which he received,   from its being known that he was a friend of the wonderful young   musician. 
  Professor Riccabocca came forward again, and recited a poem called   &quot;The Maniac,&quot; each stanza ending with the line: &quot;I am not mad, but   soon shall be.&quot; 
  He stamped, raved, tore his hair, and made altogether a very   grotesque appearance. 
  Philip could hardly forbear laughing, and some of the boys in the   front seats didn't restrain themselves, Some of the older people   wondered how such a man should be selected by the Prince of Wales to   instruct his sons in elocution&#8212;not suspecting that the newspaper   paragraph making mention of this was only a daring invention of the   eminent professor. 
  Next came another musical selection by Philip, which was as   cordially received as the first. 
  I do not propose to weary the reader by a recital of the program  and  a detailed account of each performance. It is enough to say that   Professor Riccabocca excited some amusement, but was only tolerated   for the sake of Philip's playing. 
  Naturally, our hero was better received on account of his youth,  but  had he been twice as old his playing would have given satisfaction   and pleasure. 
  So passed an hour and a half, and the musical entertainment was   over. Philip felt that he had reason to be satisfied. Highly as he   had been heralded, no one appeared to feel disappointed by his part   of the performance. 
  &quot;Mr. de Gray,&quot; said the professor, when they reached the hotel,  &quot;you  did splendidly. We have made a complete success.&quot; 
  &quot;It is very gratifying,&quot; said Philip. 
  &quot;I felt sure that the public would appreciate us. I think I managed   everything shrewdly.&quot; 
  &quot;How much was paid in at the door?&quot; asked Philip, who naturally  felt  interested in this phase of success. 
  &quot;One hundred and forty-five dollars and a half!&quot; answered the   professor. 
  Philip's eyes sparkled. 
  &quot;And how much will that be over and above expenses?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;My dear Mr. de Gray, we will settle all bills, and make a fair and   equitable division, in the morning. I think there will be a little   more than fifty dollars to come to each of us.&quot; 
  &quot;Fifty dollars for one evening's work!&quot; repeated Philip, his eyes   sparkling. 
  &quot;Oh, I have done much better than that,&quot; said the professor. &quot;I   remember once at St. Louis I made for myself alone one hundred and   eighty dollars net, and in Chicago a little more.&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't think it was such a money-making business,&quot; said Philip,   elated. 
  &quot;Yes, Mr. de Gray, the American people are willing to recognize   talent, when it is genuine. You are on the threshold of a great   career, my dear young friend.&quot; 
  &quot;And only a week since I was in the Norton Poorhouse,&quot; thought   Philip. &quot;It is certainly a case of romance in real life.&quot; 
  The two went to bed soon, being fatigued by their exertions. The   apartment was large, and contained two beds, a larger and smaller   one. The latter was occupied by our hero. 
  When he awoke in the morning, the sun was shining brightly into the   room. Philip looked toward the opposite bed. It was empty. 
  &quot;Professor Riccabocca must have got up early,&quot; he thought.  &quot;Probably  he did not wish to wake me.&quot; 
  He dressed and went downstairs. 
  &quot;Where is the professor?&quot; he asked of the clerk. 
  &quot;He started away two hours since&#8212;said he was going to take a walk.   Went away without his breakfast, too. He must be fond of walking.&quot; 
  Philip turned pale. He was disturbed by a terrible suspicion. Had   the professor gone off for good, carrying all the money with him?
