<b>EUELPIDES (TO HIS JAY)</b>[1]<br> Do you think I should walk straight for yon tree? 
<small>[1] Euelpides is holding a jay and Pisthetaerus a crow; they are the guides who are to lead them to the kingdom of the birds.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS (TO HIS CROW)</b><br> Cursed beast, what are you croaking to me?...to retrace my steps? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Why, you wretch, we are wandering at random, we are exerting ourselves only to return to the same spot; 'tis labour lost. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> To think that I should trust to this crow, which has made me cover more than a thousand furlongs! 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And that I to this jay, which has torn every nail from my fingers! 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> If only I knew where we were.... 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Could you find your country again from here? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> No, I feel quite sure I could not, any more than could Execestides[1] find his. 
<small>[1] A stranger who wanted to pass as an Athenian, although coming originally for a far-away barbarian country.</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Oh dear! oh dear! 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Aye, aye, my friend, 'tis indeed the road of "oh dears" we are following. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> That Philocrates, the bird-seller, played us a scurvy trick, when he pretended these two guides could help us to find Tereus,[1] the Epops, who is a bird, without being born of one. He has indeed sold us this jay, a true son of Tharelides,[2] for an obolus, and this crow for three, but what can they do? Why, nothing whatever but bite and scratch! --What's the matter with you then, that you keep opening your beak? Do you want us to fling ourselves headlong down these rocks? There is no road that way. 
<small>[1] A king of Thrace, a son of Ares, who married Procne, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens, whom he had assisted against the Megarians. He violated his sister-in-law, Philomela, and then cut out her tongue; she nevertheless managed to convey to her sister how she had been treated. They both agreed to kill Itys, whom Procne had borne to Tereus, and dished up the limbs of his own son to the father; at the end of the meal Philomela appeared and threw the child's head upon the table. Tereus rushed with drawn sword upon the princesses, but all the actors in this terrible scene were metamorph[o]sed. Tereus became an Epops (hoopoe), Procne a swallow, Philomela a nightingale, and Itys a goldfinch. According to Anacreon and Apollodorus it was Procne who became the nightingale and Philomela the swallow, and this is the version of the tradition followed by Aristophanes.</small> 
<small>[2] An Athenian who had some resemblance to a jay--so says the scholiast, at any rate.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Not even the vestige of a track in any direction. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And what does the crow say about the road to follow? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> By Zeus, it no longer croaks the same thing it did. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And which way does it tell us to go now? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> It says that, by dint of gnawing, it will devour my fingers. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> What misfortune is ours! we strain every nerve to get to the birds,[1] do everything we can to that end, and we cannot find our way! Yes, spectators, our madness is quite different from that of Sacas. He is not a citizen, and would fain be one at any cost; we, on the contrary, born of an honourable tribe and family and living in the midst of our fellow-citizens, we have fled from our country as hard as ever we could go. 'Tis not that we hate it; we recognize it to be great and rich, likewise that everyone has the right to ruin himself; but the crickets only chirrup among the fig-trees for a month or two, whereas the Athenians spend their whole lives in chanting forth judgments from their law-courts.[2] That is why we started off with a basket, a stew-pot and some myrtle boughs[3] and have come to seek a quiet country in which to settle. We are going to Tereus, the Epops, to learn from him, whether, in his aerial flights, he has noticed some town of this kind. 
<small>[1] Literally, 'to go to the crows,' a proverbial expression equivalent to our 'going to the devil.'</small> 
<small>[2] They leave Athens because of their hatred of lawsuits and informers; this is the especial failing of the Athenians satirized in 'The Wasps.'</small> 
<small>[3] Myrtle boughs were used in sacrifices, and the founding of every colony was started by a sacrifice.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Here! look! 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> What's the matter? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Why, the crow has been pointing me to something up there for some time now. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And the jay is also opening its beak and craning its neck to show me I know not what. Clearly, there are some birds about here. We shall soon know, if we kick up a noise to start them. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Do you know what to do? Knock your leg against this rock. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And you your head to double the noise. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Well then use a stone instead; take one and hammer with it. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Good idea! Ho there, within! Slave! slave! 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> What's that, friend! You say, "slave," to summon Epops! It would be much better to shout, "Epops, Epops!" 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Well then, Epops! Must I knock again? Epops! 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> Who's there? Who calls my master? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Apollo the Deliverer! what an enormous beak![1] 
<small>[1] The actors wore masks made to resemble the birds they were supposed to represent.</small> 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> Good god! they are bird-catchers. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> The mere sight of him petrifies me with terror. What a horrible monster. 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> Woe to you! 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> But we are not men. 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> What are you, then? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> I am the Fearling, an African bird. 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> You talk nonsense. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Well, then, just ask it of my feet.[1] 
<small>[1] Fear had had disastrous effects upon Euelpides' internal  economy, and this his feet evidenced.</small> 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> And this other one, what bird is it? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> I? I am a Cackling,[1] from the land of the pheasants. 
<small>[1] The same mishap had occurred to Pisthetaerus.</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> But you yourself, in the name of the gods! what animal are you? 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> Why, I am a slave-bird. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Why, have you been conquered by a cock? 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> No, but when my master was turned into a peewit, he begged me to become a bird too, to follow and to serve him. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Does a bird need a servant, then? 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> 'Tis no doubt because he was a man. At times he wants to eat a dish of loach from Phalerum; I seize my dish and fly to fetch him some. Again he wants some pea-soup; I seize a ladle and a pot and run to get it. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> This is, then, truly a running-bird.[1] Come, Trochilus, do us the kindness to call your master. 
<small>[1] The Greek word for a wren is derived from the same root as 'to run.'</small> 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> Why, he has just fallen asleep after a feed of myrtle-berries and a few grubs. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Never mind; wake him up. 
<b>TROCHILUS</b><br> I an certain he will be angry. However, I will wake him to please you. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> You cursed brute! why, I am almost dead with terror! 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Oh! my god! 'twas sheer fear that made me lose my jay. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Ah! you great coward! were you so frightened that you let go your jay? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And did you not lose your crow, when you fell sprawling on the ground? Pray tell me that. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> No, no. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Where is it, then? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> It has flown away. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Then you did not let it go? Oh! you brave fellow! 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Open the forest,[1] that I may go out! 
<small>[1] No doubt there was some scenery to represent a forest. Besides, there is a pun intended. The words answering for 'forests' and 'door' in Greek only differ slightly in sound.</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> By Heracles! what a creature! what plumage! What means this triple crest? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Who wants me? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> The twelve great gods have used you ill, meseems. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Are you chaffing me about my feathers? I have been a man, strangers. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> 'Tis not you we are jeering at. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> At what, then? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Why, 'tis your beak that looks so odd to us. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> This is how Sophocles outrages me in his tragedies. Know, I once was Tereus.[1] 
<small>[1] Sophocles had written a tragedy about Tereus, in which, no doubt, the king finally appears as a hoopoe.</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> You were Tereus, and what are you now? a bird or a peacock?[1] 
<small>[1] One would expect the question to be "bird or man." --Are you a peacock? The hoopoe resembles the peacock inasmuch as both have crests.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> I am a bird. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Then where are your feathers? For I don't see them. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> They have fallen off. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Through illness? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> No. All birds moult their feathers, you know, every winter, and others grow in their place. But tell me, who are you? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> We? We are mortals. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br>  From what country? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br>  From the land of the beautiful galleys.[1] 
<small>[1] Athens.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Are you dicasts?[1] 
<small>[1] The Athenians were madly addicted to lawsuits. (See 'The Wasps.')</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> No, if anything, we are anti-dicasts. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Is that kind of seed sown among you?[1] 
<small>[1] As much as to say, 'Then you have such things as anti-dicasts?'  And Euelpides practically replaces, 'Very few.'</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> You have to look hard to find even a little in our fields. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> What brings you here? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> We wish to pay you a visit. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> What for? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Because you formerly were a man, like we are, formerly you had debts, as we have, formerly you did not want to pay them, like ourselves; furthermore, being turned into a bird, you have when flying seen all lands and seas. Thus you have all human knowledge as well as that of birds. And hence we have come to you to beg you to direct us to some cosy town, in which one can repose as if on thick coverlets. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> And are you looking for a greater city than Athens? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> No, not a greater, but one more pleasant to dwell in. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Then you are looking for an aristocratic country. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> I? Not at all! I hold the son of Scellias in horror.[1] 
<small>[1] His name was Aristocrates; he was a general and commanded a fleet sent in aid of Corcyra.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> But, after all, what sort of city would please you best? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> A place where the following would be the most important business transacted. --Some friend would come knocking at the door quite early in the morning saying, "By Olympian Zeus, be at my house early, as soon as you have bathed, and bring your children too. I am giving a nuptial feast, so don't fail, or else don't cross my threshold when I am in distress." 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Ah! that's what may be called being fond of hardships! And what say you? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> My tastes are similar. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> And they are? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> I want a town where the father of a handsome lad will stop in the street and say to me reproachfully as if I had failed him, "Ah! Is this well done, Stilbonides! You met my son coming from the bath after the gymnasium and you neither spoke to him, nor embraced him, nor took him with you, nor ever once twitched his parts. Would anyone call you an old  friend of mine?" 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Ah! wag, I see you are fond of suffering. But there is a city of delights, such as you want. 'Tis on the Red Sea. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Oh, no. Not a sea-port, where some fine morning the Salaminian[1] galley can appear, bringing a writ-server along. Have you no Greek town you can propose to us? 
<small>[1] The State galley, which carried the officials of the Athenian republic to their several departments and brought back those whose time had expired; it was this galley that was sent to Sicily to fetch back Alcibiades, who was accused of sacrilege.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Why not choose Lepreum in Elis for your settlement? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> By Zeus! I could not look at Lepreum without disgust, because of Melanthius.[1] 
<small>[1] A tragic poet, who was a leper; there is a play, of course, on the word Lepreum.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Then, again, there is the Opuntian, where you could live. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> I would not be Opuntian[1] for a talent. But come, what is it like to live with the birds? You should know pretty well. 
<small>[1] An allusion to Opuntius, who was one-eyed.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Why, 'tis not a disagreeable life. In the first place, one has no purse. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> That does away with much roguery. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> For food the gardens yield us white sesame, myrtle-berries, poppies and mint. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Why, 'tis the life of the newly-wed indeed.[1] 
<small>[1] The newly-married ate a sesame-cake, decorated with garlands of myrtle, poppies and mint.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Ha! I am beginning to see a great plan, which will transfer the supreme power to the birds, if you will but take my advice. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Take your advice? In what way? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> In what way? Well, firstly, do not fly in all directions with open beak; it is not dignified. Among us, when we see a thoughtless man, we ask, "What sort of bird is this?" and Teleas answers, "'Tis a man who has no brain, a bird that has lost his head, a creature you cannot catch, for it never remains in any one place." 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> By Zeus himself! your jest hits the mark. What then is to be done? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Found a city. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> We birds? But what sort of city should we build? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Oh, really, really! 'tis spoken like a fool! Look down. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> I am looking. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Now look upwards. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> I am looking. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Turn your head round. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Ah! 'twill be pleasant for me, if I end in twisting my neck! 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> What have you seen? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> The clouds and the sky. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Very well! is not this the pole of the birds then? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> How their pole? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Or, if you like it, the land. And since it turns and passes through the whole universe, it is called, 'pole.'[1] If you build and fortify it, you will turn your pole into a fortified city.[2] In this way you will reign over mankind as you do over the grasshoppers and cause the gods to die of rabid hunger 
<small>[1] From [the word meaning] 'to turn.'</small> 
<small>[2] The Greek words for 'pole' and 'city' only differ by a single letter.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> How so? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> The air is 'twixt earth and heaven. When we want to go to Delphi, we ask the Boeotians[1] for leave of passage; in the same way, when men sacrifice to the gods, unless the latter pay you tribute, you exercise the right of every nation towards strangers and don't allow the smoke of the sacrifices to pass through your city and territory. 
<small>[1] Boeotia separated Attica from Phocis.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> By earth! by snares! by network![1] I never heard of anything more cleverly conceived; and, if the other birds approve, I am going to build the city along with you. 
<small>[1] He swears by the powers that are to him dreadful.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Who will explain the matter to them? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> You must yourself. Before I came they were quite ignorant, but since I have lived with them I have taught them to speak. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> But how can they be gathered together? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Easily. I will hasten down to the coppice to waken my dear Procne![1] as soon as they hear our voices, they will come to us hot wing. 
<small>[1] As already stated, according to the legend accepted by Aristophanes, it was Procne who was turned into the nightengale.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> My dear bird, lose no time, I beg. Fly at once into the coppice and awaken Procne. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Chase off drowsy sleep, dear companion. Let the sacred hymn gush from thy divine throat in melodious strains; roll forth in soft cadence your refreshing melodies to bewail the fate of Itys,[1] which has been the cause of so many tears to us both. Your pure notes rise through the thick leaves of the yew-tree right up to the throne of Zeus, where Phoebus listens to you, Phoebus with his golden hair. And his ivory lyre responds to your plaintive accents; he gathers the choir of the gods and from their immortal lips rushes a sacred chant of blessed voices. (THE FLUTE IS PLAYED BEHIND THE SCENE.) 
<small>[1] The son of Tereus and Procne.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Oh! by Zeus! what a throat that little bird possesses. He has filled the whole coppice with honey-sweet melody! 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Hush! 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> What's the matter? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Will you keep silence? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> What for? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Epops is going to sing again. 
<b>EPOPS (IN THE COPPICE)</b><br> Epopoi poi popoi, epopoi, popoi, here, here, quick, quick, quick, my comrades in the air; all you who pillage the fertile lands of the husbandmen, the numberless tribes who gather and devour the barley seeds, the swift flying race who sing so sweetly. And you whose gentle twitter resounds through the fields with the little cry of tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio, tio; and you who hop about the branches of the ivy in the gardens; the mountain birds, who feed on the wild olive berries or the arbutus, hurry to come at my call, trioto, trioto, totobrix; you also, who snap up the sharp-stinging gnats in the marshy vales, and you who dwell in the fine plain of Marathon, all damp with dew, and you, the francolin with speckled wings; you too, the halcyons, who flit over the swelling waves of the sea, come hither to hear the tidings; let all the tribes of long-necked birds assemble here; know that a clever old man has come to us, bringing an entirely new idea and proposing great reforms. Let all come to the debate here, here, here, here. Torotorotorotorotix, kikkobau, kikkobau, torotorotorotorolililix. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Can you see any bird? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> By Phoebus, no! and yet I am straining my eyesight to scan the sky. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> 'Twas really not worth Epops' while to go and bury himself in the thicket like a plover when a-hatching. 
<b>PHOENICOPTERUS</b><br> Torotina, torotina. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Hold, friend, here is another bird. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> I' faith, yes, 'tis a bird, but of what kind? Isn't it a peacock? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Epops will tell us. What is this bird? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> 'Tis not one of those you are used to seeing; 'tis a bird from the marshes. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Oh! oh! but he is very handsome with his wings as crimson as flame. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Undoubtedly; indeed he is called flamingo.[1] 
<small>[1] An African bird, that comes to the southern countries of Europe,  to Greece, Italy, and Spain; it is even seen in Provence.</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Hi! I say! You! 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> What are you shouting for? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Why, here's another bird. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Aye, indeed; 'tis a foreign bird too. What is this bird from beyond the mountains with a look as solemn as it is stupid? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> He is called the Mede.[1] 
<small>[1] Aristophanes amusingly mixes up real birds with people and individuals, whom he represents in the form of birds; he is personifying the Medians here.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> The Mede! But, by Heracles, how, if a Mede, has he flown here without a camel? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Here's another bird with a crest. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Ah! that's curious. I say, Epops, you are not the only one of your kind then? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> This bird is the son of Philocles, who is the son of Epops;[1] so that, you see, I am his grandfather; just as one might say, Hipponicus,[2] the son of Callias, who is the son of Hipponicus. 
<small>[1] Philocles, a tragic poet, had written a tragedy on Tereus, which was simply a plagiarism of the play of the same name by Sophocles. Philocles is the son of Epops, because he got his inspiration from Sophocles' Tereus, and at the same time is father to Epops, since he himself produced another Tereus.</small> 
<small>[2] This Hipponicus is probably the orator whose ears Alcibiades boxed to gain a bet; he was a descendant of Callias, who was famous for his hatred of Pisistratus.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Then this bird is Callias! Why, what a lot of his feathers he has lost![1] 
<small>[1] This Callias, who must not be confounded with the foe of Pisistratus, had ruined himself.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> That's because he is honest; so the informers set upon him and the women too pluck out his feathers. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> By Posidon, do you see that many-coloured bird? What is his name? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> This one? 'Tis the glutton. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Is there another glutton besides Cleonymus? But why, if he is Cleonymus, has he not thrown away his crest?[1] But what is the meaning of all these crests? Have these birds come to contend for the double stadium prize?[2] 
<small>[1] Cleonymus had cast away his shield; he was as great a glutton as he was a coward.</small> 
<small>[2] A race in which the track had to be circled twice.</small> 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> They are like the Carians, who cling to the crests of their mountains for greater safety.[1] 
<small>[1] A people of Asia Minor; when pursued by the Ionians they took refuge in the mountains.</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Oh, Posidon! do you see what swarms of birds are gathering here? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> By Phoebus! what a cloud! The entrance to the stage is no longer visible, so closely do they fly together. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Here is the partridge. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Faith! there is the francolin. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> There is the poachard. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Here is the kingfisher. And over yonder? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> 'Tis the barber. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> What? a bird a barber? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Why, Sporgilus is one.[1] Here comes the owl. 
<small>[1] An Athenian barber.</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And who is it brings an owl to Athens?[1] 
<small>[1] The owl was dedicated to Athene, and being respected at Athens, it had greatly multiplied. Hence the proverb, 'taking owls to Athens,' similar to our English 'taking coals to Newcastle.'</small> 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Here is the magpie, the turtle-dove, the swallow, the horned owl, the buzzard, the pigeon, the falcon, the ring-dove, the cuckoo, the red-foot, the red-cap, the purple-cap, the kestrel, the diver, the ousel, the osprey, the woodpecker. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Oh! oh! what a lot of birds! what a quantity of blackbirds! how they scold, how they come rushing up! What a noise! what a noise! Can they be bearing us ill-will? Oh! there! there! they are opening their beaks and staring at us. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Why, so they are. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Popopopopopopopoi. Where is he who called me? Where am I to find him? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> I have been waiting for you this long while! I never fail in my word to my friends. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Titititititititi. What good thing have you to tell me? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Something that concerns our common safety, and that is just as pleasant as it is to the purpose. Two men, who are subtle reasoners, have come here to seek me. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Where? What? What are you saying? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> I say, two old men have come from the abode of men to propose a vast and splendid scheme to us. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Oh! 'tis a horrible, unheard-of crime! What are you saying? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Nay! never let my words scare you. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> What have you done then? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> I have welcomed two men, who wish to live with us. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> And you have dared to do that! 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Aye, and am delighted at having done so. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Where are they? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> In your midst, as I am. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Ah! ah! we are betrayed; 'tis sacrilege! Our friend, he who picked up corn-seeds in the same plains as ourselves, has violated our ancient laws; he has broken the oaths that bind all birds; he has laid a snare for me, he has handed us over to the attacks of that impious race which, throughout all time, has never ceased to war against us. As for this traitorous bird, we will decide his case later, but the two old men shall be punished forthwith; we are going to tear them to pieces. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> 'Tis all over with us. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> You are the sole cause of all our trouble. Why did you bring me from down yonder? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> To have you with me. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Say rather to have me melt into tears. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Go to! you are talking nonsense. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> How so? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> How will you be able to cry when once your eyes are pecked out? 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Io! io! forward to the attack, throw yourselves upon the foe, spill his blood; take to your wings and surround them on all sides. Woe to them! let us get to work with our beaks, let us devour them. Nothing can save them from our wrath, neither the mountain forests, nor the clouds that float in the sky, nor the foaming deep. Come, peck, tear to ribbons. Where is the chief of the cohort? Let him engage the right wing. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> This is the fatal moment. Where shall I fly to, unfortunate wretch that I am? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Stay! stop here! 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> That they may tear me to pieces? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> And how do you think to escape them? 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> I don't know at all. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Come, I will tell you. We must stop and fight them. Let us arm ourselves with these stew-pots. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Why with the stew-pots? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> The owl will not attack us.[1] 
<small>[1] An allusion to the Feast of Pots; it was kept at Athens on the third day of the Anthesteria, when all sorts of vegetables were stewed together and offered for the dead to Bacchus and Athene. This Feast was peculiar to Athens. --Hence Pisthetaerus thinks that the owl will recognize they are Athenians by seeing the stew-pots, and as he is an Athenian bird, he will not attack them.</small> 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> But do you see all those hooked claws? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Seize the spit and pierce the foe on your side. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> And how about my eyes? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Protect them with this dish or this vinegar-pot. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> Oh! what cleverness! what inventive genius! You are a great general, even greater than Nicias,[1] where stratagem is concerned. 
<small>[1] Nicias, the famous Athenian general. --The siege of Melos in 417  B.C., or two years previous to the production of 'The Birds,' had especially done him great credit. He was joint commander of the Sicilian expedition.</small> 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Forward, forward, charge with your beaks! Come, no delay. Tear, pluck, strike, flay them, and first of all smash the stew-pot. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Oh, most cruel of all animals, why tear these two men to pieces, why kill them? What have they done to you? They belong to the same tribe, to the same family as my wife.[1] 
<small>[1] Procne, the daughter of Pandion, King of Athens.</small> 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Are wolves to be spared? Are they not our most mortal foes? So let us punish them. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> If they are your foes by nature, they are your friends in heart, and they come here to give you useful advice. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Advice or a useful word from their lips, from them, the enemies of my forebears! 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> The wise can often profit by the lessons of a foe, for caution is the mother of safety. 'Tis just such a thing as one will not learn from a friend and which an enemy compels you to know. To begin with, 'tis the foe and not the friend that taught cities to build high walls, to equip long vessels of war; and 'tis this knowledge that protects our children, our slaves and our wealth. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Well then, I agree, let us first hear them, for 'tis best; one can even learn something in an enemy's school. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> Their wrath seems to cool. Draw back a little. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> 'Tis only justice, and you will thank me later. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Never have we opposed your advice up to now. 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> They are in a more peaceful mood; put down your stew-pot and your two dishes; spit in hand, doing duty for a spear, let us mount guard inside the camp close to the pot and watch in our arsenal closely; for we must not fly. 
<b>EUELPIDES</b><br> You are right. But where shall we be buried, if we die? 
<b>PISTHETAERUS</b><br> In the Ceramicus;[1] for, to get a public funeral, we shall tell the Strategi that we fell at Orneae,[2] fighting the country's foes. 
<small>[1] A space beyond the walls of Athens which contained the gardens of the Academy and the graves of citizens who had died for their country.</small> 
<small>[2] A town in Western Argolis, where the Athenians had been recently defeated. The somewhat similar work in Greek signifies 'birds.'</small> 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Return to your ranks and lay down your courage beside your wrath as the Hoplites do. Then let us ask these men who they are, whence they come, and with what intent. Here, Epops, answer me. 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Are you calling me? What do you want of me? 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Who are they? From what country? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Strangers, who have come from Greece, the land of the wise. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> And what fate has led them hither to the land of the birds? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> Their love for you and their wish to share your kind of life; to dwell and remain with you always. 
<b>CHORUS</b><br> Indeed, and what are their plans? 
<b>EPOPS</b><br> They are wonderful, incredible, unheard of.
