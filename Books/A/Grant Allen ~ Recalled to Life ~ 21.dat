As Jack went on unfolding that strange tale of fraud and heartless  wrong, my interest every moment grew more and more absorbing. But I  can't recall it now exactly as Jack told me it. I can only give you  the substance of that terrible story.    
When Richard Wharton first learned of his wife's second marriage  during his own lifetime to that wicked wretch who had ousted and  supplanted him, he believed also, on the strength of Vivian  Callingham's pretences, that his own daughter had died in her  babyhood in Australia. He fancied, therefore, that no person of his  kin remained alive at all, and that he might proceed to denounce and  punish Vivian Callingham. With that object in view, he tramped down  all the way from London to Torquay, to make himself known to his  wife's relations, the Moores, and to their cousin, Courtenay Ivor of  Babbicombe--my Jack, as I called him. For various reasons of his  own, he called first on Jack, and proceeded to detail to him this  terrible family story.    
At first hearing, Jack could hardly believe such a tale was true--of  his Una's father, as he still thought Vivian Callingham. But a  strange chance happened to reveal a still further complication. It  came out in this way. I had given Jack a recent photograph of myself  in fancy dress, which hung up over his mantelpiece. As the  weather-worn visitor's eye fell on the picture, he started and grew  pale.    
"Why, that's her!" he cried with a sudden gasp. "That's my  daughter--Mary Wharton!"    
Well, naturally enough Jack thought, to begin with, this was a mere  mistake on his strange visitor's part.    
"That's her half-sister," he said, "Una Callingham--your wife's  child by her second marriage. She may be like her, no doubt, as  half-sisters often are. But Mary Wharton, I know, died some eighteen  years ago or so, when Una was quite a baby, I believe. I've heard  all about it, because, don't you see, I'm engaged to Una."    
The poor wreck of a clergyman, however, shook his head with profound  conviction. He knew better than that.    
"Oh no," he said decisively: "that's my child, Mary Wharton. Even  after all these years, I couldn't possibly be mistaken. Blood is  thicker than water: I'd know her among ten thousand. She'd be just  that age now, too. I see the creature's vile plot. His daughter died  young, and he's palmed off my Mary as his own child, to keep her  money in his hands. But never mind the money. Thank Heaven, she's  alive! That's her! That's my Mary!"    
The plot seemed too diabolical and too improbable for anybody to  believe. Jack could hardly think it possible when his new friend  told him. But the stranger persisted so--it's hard for me even to  think of him as quite really my father--that Jack at last brought  out two or three earlier photographs I'd given him some time before;  and his visitor recognised them at once, in all their stages, as his  own daughter. This roused Jack's curiosity. He determined to hunt  the matter up with his unknown connection. And he hunted it up  thenceforward with deliberate care, till he proved every word of it.    
Meanwhile, the poor broken-down man, worn out with his long tramp  and his terrible emotions, fell ill almost at once, in Jack's own  house, and became rapidly so feeble that Jack dared not question him  further. The return to civilisation was more fatal than his long  solitary banishment. At the end of a week he died, leaving on Jack's  mind a profound conviction that all he had said was true, and that I  was really Richard Wharton's daughter, not Vivian Callingham's.    
"For a week or two I made inquiries, Una," Jack said to me as we sat  there,--"inquiries which I won't detail to you in full just now, but  which gradually showed me the truth of the poor soul's belief. What  you yourself told me just now chimes in exactly with what I  discovered elsewhere, by inquiry and by letters from Australia. The  baby that died was the real Una Callingham. Shortly after its death,  your stepfather and your mother left the colony. All your real  father's money had been bequeathed to his child: and your mother's  also was settled on you. Mr. Callingham saw that if your mother  died, and you lived and married, he himself would be deprived of the  fortune for which he had so wickedly plotted. So he made up another  plot even more extraordinary and more diabolical still than the  first. He decided to pretend it was Mary Wharton that died, and to  palm you off on the world as his own child, Una Callingham. For if  Mary Wharton died, the property at once became absolutely your  mother's, and she could will it away to her husband or anyone else  she chose to."    
"But baby was so much younger than I!" I cried, going back on my  recollections once more. "How could he ever manage to make the dates  come right again?"    
"Quite true," Jack answered; "the baby was younger than you. But  your step-father--I've no other name by which I can call him--made a  clever plan to set that straight. He concealed from the people in  Australia which child had been ill, and he entered her death as Mary  Wharton. Then, to cover the falsification, he left Melbourne at  once, and travelled about for some years on the Continent in  out-of-the-way places till all had been forgotten. You went forth  upon the world as Una Callingham, with your true personality as Mary  Wharton all obscured even in your own memory. Fortunately for your  false father's plot, you were small for your age, and developed  slowly: he gave out, on the contrary, that you were big for your  years and had outgrown yourself, Australian-wise, both in wisdom and  stature."    
"But my mother!" I exclaimed, appalled. 'How could she ever consent  to such a wicked deception?"    
"Mr. Callingham had your mother completely under his thumb," Jack  answered with promptitude. "She couldn't call her soul her own, your  poor mother--so I've heard: he cajoled her and terrified her till  she didn't dare to oppose him. Poor shrinking creature, she was  afraid of her life to do anything except as he bade her. He must  have persuaded her first to acquiesce passively in this hateful  plot, and then must have terrified her afterwards into full  compliance by threats of exposure."    
"He was a very unhappy man himself," I put in, casting back. "His  money did him no good. I can remember now how gloomy and moody he  was often, at The Grange."    
"Quite true," Jack replied. "He lived in perpetual fear of your real  father's return, or of some other breakdown to his complicated  system of successive deceptions. He never had a happy minute in his  whole life, I believe. Blind terrors surrounded him. He was afraid  of everything, and afraid of everybody. Only his scientific work  seemed ever to give him any relief. There, he became a free man. He  threw himself into that, heart and soul, on purpose, I fancy,  because it absorbed him while he was at it, and prevented him for  the time being from thinking of his position."    
"And how did you find it all out?" I asked eagerly, anxious to get  on to the end.    
"Well, that's long to tell," Jack replied. "Too long for one  sitting. I won't trouble you with it now. Discrepancies in facts and  dates, and inquiries among servants both in England and in Victoria,  first put me upon the track. But I said nothing at the time of my  suspicions to anyone. I waited till I could appeal to the man's own  conscience with success, as I hoped. And then, besides, I hardly  knew how to act for the best. I wanted to marry you; and therefore,  as far as was consistent with justice and honour, I wished to spare  your supposed father a complete exposure."    
"But why didn't you tell the police?" I asked.    
"Because I had really nothing definite in any way to go upon.  Realise the position to yourself, and you'll see how difficult it  was for me. Mr. Callingham suspected I was paying you attentions.  Clearly, under those circumstances, it was to my obvious interest  that you should get possession of all his property. Any claims I  might make for you would, therefore, be naturally regarded with  suspicion. The shipwrecked man had told nobody but myself. I hadn't  even an affidavit, a death-bed statement. All rested upon his word,  and upon mine as retailing it. He was dead, and there was nothing  but my narrative for what he told me. The story itself was too  improbable to be believed by the police on such dubious evidence. I  didn't even care to try. I wanted to make your step-father confess:  and I waited for that till I could compel confession."
