   The stage rumbled along the main street of Granville, and drew up  in front of the only hotel of which the village could boast. The driver  descended from his throne, and coming round to the side opened the door  and addressed the only passenger remaining within. &quot;Where do you want  to go, miss?&quot; A girl's face looked out inquiringly. &quot;Is this the  hotel?&quot; she asked. &quot;Yes, miss.&quot; 
  &quot;I will get out here,&quot; she said quietly. 
  There were a few loungers on the piazza, which extended along the  whole front of the building. As she descended with a light and springy  step, disregarding the proffered aid of the driver, they eyed her  curiously. 
  &quot;Who is she, Abner?&quot; asked Timothy Varnum of the driver, as the  stranger entered the house. 
  &quot;I reckon she's the new school teacher,&quot; said Abner; &quot;I heard  Squire Hadley say she was expected today.&quot; 
  &quot;Where does she come from?&quot; 
  &quot;York State, somewhere. I don't justly know where.&quot; 
  &quot;Looks like a city gal.&quot; 
  &quot;Mebbe, though I don't think it would pay a city gal to come to  Granville to teach.&quot; 
  Unconscious of the curiosity which her appearance had excited, the  girl entered the open entry and paused. A middle aged woman, evidently  the landlady of the inn, speedily made her appearance. &quot;Good afternoon,  miss,&quot; she said. &quot;Shall I show you to a room?&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you,&quot; said the stranger, gratefully. &quot;I shall be very glad  if you will. The ride has been warm and dusty. My trunks are on the  stage &#151; &#151; &quot; 
  &quot;All right, miss, I'll have them sent up. If you'll follow me up  stairs, I'll give you a room.&quot; 
  She led the way into a front room, very plainly furnished, but with  a pleasant view of the village from the windows. &quot;I think you will find  everything you require,&quot; she said, preparing to go. &quot;Supper will be  ready in half an hour, but you can have it later if you wish.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall be ready, thank you.&quot; 
  Left alone, the stranger sank into a wooden rocking chair, and  gazed thoughtfully from the window. 
  &quot;Well, I have taken the decisive step,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;It  may be a mad freak, but I must not draw back now. Instead of going to  Newport or to Europe, I have deliberately agreed to teach the grammar  school in this out of the way country place. I am wholly unknown here,  and it is hardly likely that any of my friends will find me out. For  the first time in my life I shall make myself useful &#151; perhaps. Or  will my experiment end in failure? That is a question which time alone  can solve.&quot; 
  She rose, and removing her traveling wraps, prepared for the table. 
  The new comer's two trunks were being removed from the stage when  Mrs. Slocum passed, on her way to the store. Being naturally of a  watchful and observant turn of mind, this worthy old lady made it her  business to find out all that was going on in the village. 
  &quot;Whose trunks are them, Abner? she asked, in a voice high pitched  even to shrillness. 
  &quot;They belong to the young lady that's stoppin' in the hotel. She  came in on the stage.&quot; 
  &quot;Who's she?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know any more'n you do,&quot; said Abner, who knew Mrs.  Slocum's failing, and was not anxious to gratify it. 
  &quot;There's her name on a card,&quot; said the old lady triumphantly,  pointing to one of the trunks. &quot;I hain't got my glasses with me. Just  read it off, will you?&quot; 
  Probably Abner had a little curiosity of his own. At all events he  complied with the old lady's request, and read aloud:  &quot;MISS MABEL  FROST,  Granville, N. H.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't say!&quot; ejaculated Mrs. Slocum, in a tone of interest.  &quot;Why, it's the new school teacher! What sort of a looking woman is  she?&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't notice her, partic'lar. She looked quite like a lady.&quot; 
  &quot;Are both them trunks hern?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; 
  &quot;What on airth does she want with two trunks? said Mrs. Slocum,  disapprovingly. Must be fond of dress. I hope she ain't goin' to larn  our gals to put on finery.&quot; 
  &quot;Mebbe she's got her books in one of 'em,&quot; suggested Abner. 
  &quot;A whole trunkful of books! Land sakes! You must be crazy. Nobody  but a minister would want so many books as that. An' it's a clear waste  for the parson to buy so many as he does. If he didn't spend so much  money that way, his wife could dress a little more decent. Why, the  man's got at least two or three hundred books already, and yet he's  always wantin' to buy more.&quot; 
  &quot;I guess his wife wouldn't want the trunks for her clothes,&quot;  suggested Abner. 
  &quot;You are right,&quot; said Mrs. Slocum, nodding. &quot;I declare I'm sick and  tired of that old bombazine she's worn to church the last three years.  A stranger might think we stinted the minister.&quot; 
  &quot;Precisely, Mrs. Slocum,&quot; said a voice behind her. That's my  opinion.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, Dr. Titus, is that you?&quot; said the old lady, turning. 
  &quot;What is left of me. I've been making calls all the afternoon, and  I'm used up. So you think we are stinting the minister?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I don't,&quot; said Mrs. Slocum, indignantly. &quot;I think we pay him  handsome. Five hundred dollars a year and a donation party is more'n  some of us get.&quot; 
  &quot;Deliver me from the donation party!&quot; said the doctor hastily. &quot;I  look upon that as one of the minister's trials.&quot; 
  &quot;I s'pose you will have your joke, doctor,&quot; said Mrs. Slocum, not  very well pleased. &quot;I tell you a donation party is a great help where  there's a family.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps it is; but I am glad it isn't the fashion to help doctors  in that way.&quot; 
  Dr. Titus was a free spoken man, and always had been. His practice  was only moderately lucrative but it was well known that he possessed a  competency, and could live comfortably if all his patients deserted  him; so no one took offense when he expressed heretical notions. He had  a hearty sympathy for Mr. Wilson, the Congregational minister, who  offended some of his parishioners by an outward aspect of poverty in  spite of his munificent salary of five hundred dollars a year. 
  &quot;The doctor's got queer notions,&quot; muttered Mrs. Slocum. &quot;If he  talks that way, mebbe the minister will get discontented. But as I say  to Deacon Slocum, there's more to be had, and younger men, too. I  sometimes think the minister's outlived his usefulness here. A young  man might kinder stir up the people more, and make 'em feel more  convicted of sin. But I must go and tell the folks about the new school  teacher. I'd like to see what sort she is.&quot; 
  Mrs. Slocum's curiosity was gratified. On her way back from the  store she saw Miss Frost sitting at the open window of her chamber in  the hotel. 
  &quot;Looks as if she might be proud,&quot; muttered the old lady. &quot;Fond of   dress, too. I don't believe she'll do for Granville.&quot; 
  Although Mrs. Slocum was in a hurry to get home she could not  resist the temptation to call at Squire Hadley's and let him know that  the school teacher had arrived. Squire Benjamin Hadley was the chairman  of the School Committee. Either of the two Granville ministers would  have been better fitted for the office, but the Methodists were  unwilling to elect the Congregational minister, and the Methodist  minister was opposed by members of the other parish. So Squire Hadley  was appointed as the compromise candidate, although he was a man who  would probably have found it extremely difficult to pass the most  lenient examination himself. He had left school at twelve years of age,  and circumstances had prevented his repairing the defects of early  instruction. There were times when he was troubled by a secret sense of  incompetence &#151; notably when he was called upon to examine teachers. He  had managed to meet this emergency rather cleverly, as he thought,  having persuaded Mr. Wilson to draw up for him a series of questions in  the different branches, together with the correct answers. With this  assistance he was able to acquit himself creditably. 
  &quot;Can't stay a minute, Squire,&quot; said Mrs. Slocum, standing on the  broad, flat door stone. &quot;I thought I'd jest stop an' tell ye the school  teacher has come.&quot; 
  &quot;Where is she?&quot; asked the Squire, in a tone of interest. 
  &quot;She put up at the hotel. I was there jest now, and saw her two  trunks. Rather high toned for a school teacher, I think. We don't need  two trunks for our clothes, Mrs. Hadley.&quot; 
  &quot;Young people are terrible extravagant nowadays,&quot; said Mrs. Hadley,  a tall woman, with a thin, hatchet-like face, and a sharp nose. It  wasn't so when I was young.&quot; 
  &quot;That's a good while ago, Lucretia,&quot; said the Squire, jokingly. 
  &quot;You're older than I am,&quot; said the lady tartly. &quot;It don't become  you to sneer at my age.&quot; 
  &quot;I didn't mean anything, Lucretia,&quot; said her husband in an  apologetic tone. 
  &quot;Did you see the woman, Mrs. Slocum?&quot; asked Mrs. Hadley,  condescending to let the matter drop. 
  &quot;I jest saw her looking out of the window,&quot; said Mrs. Slocum.  &quot;Looks like a vain, conceited sort.&quot; 
  &quot;Very likely she is. Mr. Hadley engaged her without knowin'  anythin' about her.&quot; 
  &quot;You know, Lucretia, she was highly recommended by Mary Bridgman in  the letter I received from her,&quot; the Squire mildly protested. 
  &quot;Mary Bridgman, indeed!&quot; his wife retorted with scorn. &quot;What does  she know of who's fit to teach school?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, we must give her a fair show. I'll call round to the hotel  after tea, and see her.&quot; 
  &quot;It's her place to call here, I should say,&quot; said the Squire's  wife, influenced by a desire to see and judge the stranger for herself. 
  &quot;I will tell her to call here tomorrow morning to be examined,&quot;  said the Squire. 
  &quot;What hour do you think you'll app'int?&quot; asked Mrs. Slocum, with a  vague idea of being present on that occasion. 
  The Squire fathomed her design, and answered diplomatically, &quot;I  shall have to find out when it'll be most convenient for Miss Frost.&quot; 
  &quot;Her convenience, indeed! &quot; ejaculated his wife. &quot;I should say that  the School Committee's convenience was more important than hers. Like  as not she knows more about dress than she does about what you've  engaged her to teach.&quot; 
  &quot;Where is she going to board?&quot; asked Mrs. Slocum, with unabated  interest in the important topic of discussion. 
  &quot;I can't tell yet.&quot; 
  &quot;I s'pose she'd like to live in style at the hotel, so she can show  off her dresses.&quot; 
  &quot;It would take all her wages to pay for board there,&quot; said the  Squire.  &quot;Mebbe I might take her,&quot; said Mrs. Slocum. &quot;I could give her  the back room over the shed.&quot; 
  &quot;I will mention it to her, Mrs. Slocum,&quot; said the Squire  diplomatically, and Mrs. Slocum hurried home. 
  &quot;You don't really intend to recommend Mrs. Slocum's as a boarding  place, Benjamin?&quot; interrogated his wife. &quot;I don't think much of the  teacher you've hired, but she'd roast to death in that stived up back  room. Besides, Mrs. Slocum is the worst cook in town. Her bread is  abominable, and I don't wonder her folks are always ailing.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't be uneasy about that, Lucretia,&quot; said the Squire. &quot;If Miss  Frost goes to Mrs. Slocum's to board, it'll have to be on somebody  else's recommendation.&quot; 
  The new school teacher was sitting at the window in her room,  supper being over, when the landlady came up to inform her that Squire  Hadley had called to see her. 
  &quot;He is the chairman of the School Committee, isn't he?&quot; asked the  stranger. 
  &quot;Yes, miss.&quot; 
  &quot;Then will you be kind enough to tell him that I will be down  directly?&quot; 
  Squire Hadley was sitting in a rocking chair in the stiff hotel  parlor, when Miss Frost entered, and said composedly, &quot;Mr. Hadley, I  believe?&quot; 
  She exhibited more self possession than might have been expected of  one in her position, in the presence of official importance. There was  not the slightest trace of nervousness in her manner, though she was  aware that the portly person before her was to examine into her  qualifications for the post she sought. 
  &quot;I apprehend,&quot; said Squire Hadley, in a tone of dignity which he  always put on when he addressed teachers, &quot;I apprehend that you are  Miss Mabel Frost.&quot; 
  &quot;You are quite right, sir. I apprehend,&quot; she added, with a slight  smile, &quot;that you are the chairman of the School Committee.&quot; 
  &quot;You apprehend correctly, Miss Frost. It affords me great pleasure  to welcome you to Granville.&quot; 
  &quot;You are very kind,&quot; said Mabel Frost demurely. 
  &quot;It is a responsible, office &#151; ahem! &#151; that of instructor of  youth,&quot; said the Squire, with labored gravity. 
  &quot;I hope I appreciate it.&quot; 
  &quot;Have you ever &#151; ahem! &#151; taught before? 
  &quot;This will be my first school.&quot; 
  &quot;This &#151; ahem! &#151; is against you, but I trust you may succeed.&quot; 
  &quot;I trust so, sir,&quot; 
  &quot;You will have to pass an examination in the studies you are to  teach &#151; before ME,&quot; said the Squire. 
  &quot;I hope you may find me competent,&quot; said Mabel modestly, 
  &quot;I hope so, Miss Frost; my examination will be searching. I feel it  my duty to the town to be very strict.&quot; 
  &quot;Would you like to examine me now, Mr. Hadley?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said the Squire hastily, &quot;no, no &#151; I haven't my papers with  me. I will trouble you to come to my house tomorrow morning, at nine  o'clock, if convenient.&quot; 
  &quot;Certainly, sir. May I ask where your house is?&quot; 
  &quot;My boy shall call for you in the morning.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you.&quot; 
  Mabel spoke as if this terminated the colloquy, but Squire Hadley  had something more to say. 
  &quot;I think we have said nothing about your wages, Miss Frost,&quot; he  remarked. 
  &quot;You can pay me whatever is usual,&quot; said Mabel, with apparent  indifference. 
  &quot;We have usually paid seven dollars a week.&quot; 
  &quot;That will be quite satisfactory, sir.&quot; 
  Soon after Squire Hadley had left the hotel Mabel Frost went slowly  up to her room. 
  &quot;So I am to earn seven dollars a week,&quot; she said to herself. &quot;This  is wealth indeed!&quot;
