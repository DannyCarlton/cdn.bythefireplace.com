  Neither Thor nor Muskwa went near the caribou meat after the big  fight. Thor was in no condition to eat, and Muskwa was so filled with  excitement and trembling that he could not swallow a mouthful. He  continued to worry a strip of black hide, snarling and growling in his  puny way, as though finishing what the other had begun.
  For many minutes the grizzly stood with his big head drooping, and  the blood gathered in splashes under him. He was facing down the  valley. There was almost no wind&#8212;so little that it was scarcely  possible to tell from which direction it came. Eddies of it were caught  in the coulees, and higher up about the shoulders and peaks it blew  stronger. Now and then one of these higher movements of air would sweep  gently downward and flow through the valley for a few moments in a  great noiseless breath that barely stirred the tops of the balsams and  spruce.
  One of these mountain-breaths came as Thor faced the east. And with  it, faint and terrible, came the<I> man-smell</I>!
  Thor roused himself with a sudden growl from the lethargy into which  he had momentarily allowed himself to sink. His relaxed muscles  hardened. He raised his head and sniffed the wind.
  Muskwa ceased his futile fight with the bit of hide and also sniffed  the air. It was warm with the man-scent, for Langdon and Bruce were  running and sweating, and the odour of man-sweat drifts heavy and far.  It filled Thor with a fresh rage. For a second time it came when he was  hurt and bleeding. He had already associated the man-smell with hurt,  and now it was doubly impressed upon him. He turned his head and  snarled at the mutilated body of the big black. Then he snarled  menacingly in the face of the wind. He was in no humour to run away. In  these moments, if Bruce and Langdon had appeared over the rise, Thor  would have charged with that deadly ferocity which lead can scarcely  stop, and which has given to his kind their terrible name.
  But the breath of air passed, and there followed a peaceful calm.  The valley was filled with the purr of running water; from their rocks  the whistlers called forth their soft notes; up on the green plain the  ptarmigan were fluting, and rising in white-winged flocks. These things  soothed Thor, as a woman's gentle hand quiets an angry man. For five  minutes he continued to rumble and growl as he tried vainly to catch  the scent again; but the rumbling and growling grew steadily less, and  finally he turned and walked slowly toward the coulee down which he and  Muskwa had come a little while before. Muskwa followed.
  [Illustration: &#8220;'Come on!' he cried. 'The black's dead! If we hustle  we can get our grizzly!'&#8220;]
  The coulee, or ravine, hid them from the valley as they ascended.  Its bottom was covered with rock and shale. The wounds Thor had  received in the fight, unlike bullet wounds, had stopped bleeding after  the first few minutes, and he left no telltale red spots behind. The  ravine took them to the first chaotic upheaval of rock halfway up the  mountain, and here they were still more lost to view from below.
  They stopped and drank at a pool formed by the melting snow on the  peaks, and then went on. Thor did not stop when they reached the ledge  on which they had slept the previous night. And this time Muskwa was  not tired when they reached the ledge. Two days had made a big change  in the little tan-faced cub. He was not so round and puffy. And he was  stronger&#8212;a great deal stronger; he was becoming hardened, and under  Thor's strenuous tutelage he was swiftly graduating from cubhood to  young bearhood.
  It was evident that Thor had followed this ledge at some previous  time. He knew where he was going. It continued up and up, and finally  seemed to end in the face of a precipitous wall of rock. Thor's trail  led him directly to a great crevice, hardly wider than his body, and  through this he went, emerging at the edge of the wildest and roughest  slide of rock that Muskwa had ever seen. It looked like a huge quarry,  and it broke through the timber far below them, and reached almost to  the top of the mountain above.
  For Muskwa to make his way over the thousand pitfalls of that  chaotic upheaval was an impossibility, and as Thor began to climb over  the first rocks the cub stopped and whined. It was the first time he  had given up, and when he saw that Thor gave no attention to his whine,  terror seized upon him and he cried for help as loudly as he could  while he hunted frantically for a path up through the rocks.
  Utterly oblivious of Muskwa's predicament, Thor continued until he  was fully thirty yards away. Then he stopped, faced about deliberately,  and waited.
  This gave Muskwa courage, and he scratched and clawed and even used  his chin and teeth in his efforts to follow. It took him ten minutes to  reach Thor, and he was completely winded. Then, all at once, his terror  vanished. For Thor stood on a white, narrow path that was as solid as a  floor.
  The path was perhaps eighteen inches wide. It was unusual&#8212;and  mysterious-looking, and strangely out of place where it was. It looked  as though an army of workmen had come along with hammers and had broken  up tons of sandstone and slate, and then filled in between the boulders  with rubble, making a smooth and narrow road that in places was ground  to the fineness of powder and the hardness of cement. But instead of  hammers, the hoofs of a hundred or perhaps a thousand generations of  mountain sheep had made the trail. It was the sheep-path over the  range. The first band of bighorn may have blazed the way before  Columbus discovered America; surely it had taken a great many years for  hoofs to make that smooth road among the rocks.
  Thor used the path as one of his highways from valley to valley, and  there were other creatures of the mountains who used it as well as he,  and more frequently. As he stood waiting for Muskwa to get his wind  they both heard an odd chuckling sound approaching them from above.  Forty or fifty feet up the slide the path twisted and descended a  little depression behind a huge boulder, and out from behind this  boulder came a big porcupine.
  There is a law throughout the North that a man shall not kill a  porcupine. He is the &#8220;lost man's friend,&#8221; for the wandering and  starving prospector or hunter can nearly always find a porcupine, if  nothing else; and a child can kill him. He is the humourist of the  wilderness&#8212;the happiest, the best-natured, and altogether the  mildest-mannered beast that ever drew breath. He talks and chatters and  chuckles incessantly, and when he travels he walks like a huge animated  pincushion; he is oblivious of everything about him as though asleep.
  As this particular &#8220;porky&#8221; advanced upon Muskwa and Thor, he was  communing happily with himself, the chuckling notes he made sounding  very much like a baby's cooing. He was enormously fat, and as he  waddled slowly along his side and tail quills clicked on the stones.  His eyes were on the path at his feet. He was deeply absorbed in  nothing at all, and he was within five feet of Thor before he saw the  grizzly. Then, in a wink, he humped himself into a ball. For a few  seconds he scolded vociferously. After that he was as silent as a  sphinx, his little red eyes watching the big bear.
  Thor did not want to kill him, but the path was narrow, and he was  ready to go on. He advanced a foot or two, and Porky turned his back  toward Thor and made ready to deliver a swipe with his powerful tail.  In that tail were several hundred quills. As Thor had more than once  come into contact with porcupine quills, he hesitated.
  Muskwa was looking on curiously. He still had his lesson to learn,  for the quill he had once picked up in his foot had been a loose quill.  But since the porcupine seemed to puzzle Thor, the cub turned and made  ready to go back along the slide if it became necessary. Thor advanced  another foot, and with a sudden<I> chuck, chuck, chuck</I>&#8212;the most  vicious sound he was capable of making&#8212;Porky advanced backward and his  broad, thick tail whipped through the air with a force that would have  driven quills a quarter of an inch into the butt of a tree. Having  missed, he humped himself again, and Thor stepped out on the boulder  and circled around him. There he waited for Muskwa.
  Porky was immensely satisfied with his triumph. He unlimbered  himself; his quills settled a bit; and he advanced toward Muskwa, at  the same time resuming his good-natured chuckling. Instinctively the  cub hugged the edge of the path, and in doing so slipped over the edge.  By the time he had scrambled up again Porky was four or five feet  beyond him and totally absorbed in his travel.
  The adventure of the sheep-trail was not yet quite over, for  scarcely had Porky maneuvered himself to safety when around the edge of  the big boulder above appeared a badger, hot on the fresh and luscious  scent of his favourite dinner, a porcupine. This worthless outlaw of  the mountains was three times as large as Muskwa, and every ounce of  him was fighting muscle and bone and claw and sharp teeth. He had a  white mark on his nose and forehead; his legs were short and thick; his  tail was bushy, and the claws on his front feet were almost as long as  a bear's. Thor greeted him with an immediate growl of warning, and the  badger scooted back up the trail in fear of his life.
  Meanwhile Porky lumbered slowly along in quest of new  feeding-grounds, talking and singing to himself, forgetting entirely  what had happened a minute or two before, and unconscious of the fact  that Thor had saved him from a death as certain as though he had fallen  over a thousand-foot precipice.
  For nearly a mile Thor and Muskwa followed the Bighorn Highway  before its winding course brought them at last to the very top of the  range. They were fully three-quarters of a mile above the creek-bottom,  and so narrow in places was the crest of the mountain along which the  sheep-trail led that they could look down into both valleys.
  To Muskwa it was all a greenish golden haze below him; the depths  seemed illimitable; the forest along the stream was only a black  streak, and the parklike clumps of balsams and cedars on the farther  slopes looked like very small bosks of thorn or buffalo willow.
  Up here the wind was blowing, too. It whipped him with a strange  fierceness, and half a dozen times he felt the mysterious and very  unpleasant chill of snow under his feet. Twice a great bird swooped  near him. It was the biggest bird he had ever seen&#8212;an eagle. The  second time it came so near that he heard the<I> beat</I> of it, and  saw its great, fierce head and lowering talons.
  Thor whirled toward the eagle and growled. If Muskwa had been alone,  the cub would have gone sailing off in those murderous talons. As it  was, the third time the eagle circled it was down the slope from them.  It was after other game. The scent of the game came to Thor and Muskwa,  and they stopped.
  Perhaps a hundred yards below them was a shelving slide of soft  shale, and on this shale, basking in the warm sun after their morning's  feed lower down, was a band of sheep. There were twenty or thirty of  them, mostly ewes and their lambs. Three huge old rams were lying on a  patch of snow farther to the east.
  With his six-foot wings spread out like twin fans, the eagle  continued to circle. He was as silent as a feather floating with the  wind. The ewes and even the old bighorns were unconscious of his  presence over them. Most of the lambs were lying close to their  mothers, but two or three of a livelier turn of mind were wandering  over the shale and occasionally hopping about in playful frolic.
  The eagle's fierce eyes were upon these youngsters. Suddenly he  drifted farther away&#8212;a full rifle-shot distance straight in the face  of the wind; then he swung gracefully, and came back with the wind. And  as he came, his wings apparently motionless, he gathered greater and  greater speed, and shot like a rocket straight for the lambs. He seemed  to have come and gone like a great shadow, and just one plaintive,  agonized bleat marked his passing-and two little lambs were left where  there had been three.
  There was instant commotion on the slide. The ewes began to run back  and forth and bleat excitedly. The three rams sprang up and stood like  rocks, their huge battlemented heads held high as they scanned the  depths below them and the peaks above for new danger.
  One of them saw Thor, and the deep, grating bleat of warning that  rattled out of his throat a hunter could have heard a mile away. As he  gave his danger signal he started down the slide, and in another moment  an avalanche of hoofs was clattering down the steep shale slope,  loosening small stones and boulders that went tumbling and crashing  down the mountain with a din that steadily increased as they set others  in motion on the way. This was all mighty interesting to Muskwa, and he  would have stood for a long time looking down for other things to  happen if Thor had not led him on.
  After a time the Bighorn Highway began to descend into the valley  from the upper end of which Thor had been driven by Langdon's first  shots. They were now six or eight miles north of the timber in which  the hunters had made their permanent camp, and headed for the lower  tributaries of the Skeena.
  Another hour of travel, and the bare shale and gray crags were above  them again, and they were on the green slopes. After the rocks, and the  cold winds, and the terrible glare he had seen in the eagle's eyes, the  warm and lovely valley into which they were descending lower and lower  was a paradise to Muskwa.
  It was evident that Thor had something in his mind. He was not  rambling now. He cut off the ends and the bulges of the slopes. With  his head hunched low he travelled steadily northward, and a compass  could not have marked out a straighter line for the lower waters of the  Skeena. He was tremendously businesslike, and Muskwa, tagging bravely  along behind, wondered if he were never going to stop; if there could  be anything in the whole wide world finer for a big grizzly and a  little tan-faced cub than these wonderful sunlit slopes which Thor  seemed in such great haste to leave.
