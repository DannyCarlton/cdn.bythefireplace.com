  Her voice broke the spell that had held him for a moment. 
  &quot;I am glad to see you,&quot; he cried, quickly, seizing both her hands.   &quot;Only I haven't quite yet awakened from my dream. It seems too   wonderful, almost unreal. Are you the old Eileen who used to  shudder  when I told you of a bit of jungle and wild beasts, and  who laughed at  me because I loved to sleep out-of-doors and tramp  mountains, instead  of decently behaving myself at home? I demand  an explanation. It must  be a wonderful change&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;There has been a change,&quot; she interrupted him. &quot;Sit down, Philip   &#8212;there!&quot; She nestled herself on a stool, close to his feet, and   looked up at him, her hands clasped under her chin, radiantly  lovely.  &quot;You told me once that girls like me simply fluttered over  the top of  life like butterflies; that we couldn't understand  life, or live it,  until somewhere&#8212;at some time&#8212;we came into  touch with nature. Do you  remember? I was consumed with rage then  &#8212;at your frankness, at what I  considered your impertinence. I  couldn't get what you said out of my  mind. And I'm trying it.&quot; 
  &quot;And you like it?&quot; He put the question almost eagerly. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; She was looking at him steadily, her beautiful gray eyes   meeting his own in a silence that stirred him deeply. He had never   seen her more beautiful. Was it the firelight on her face, the   crimson leapings of the flames, that gave her skin a richer hue?  Was  it the mingling of fire and shadow that darkened her cheeks?  An  impulse made him utter the words which passed through his mind. 
  &quot;You have already tried it,&quot; he said. &quot;I can see the effects of it   in your face. It would take weeks in the forests to do that.&quot; 
  The gray eyes faltered; the flush deepened. 
  &quot;Yes, I have tried it. I spent a half of the summer at our cottage   on the lake.&quot; 
  &quot;But it is not tan,&quot; he persisted, thrilled for a moment by the   discoveries he was making. &quot;It is the wind; it is the open; it is  the  smoke of camp-fires; it is the elixir of balsam and cedar and  pine.  That is what I see in your face&#8212;unless it is the fire.&quot; 
  &quot;It is the fire, partly,&quot; she said. &quot;And the rest is the wind and   the open of the seas we have come across, and the sting of  icebergs.  Ugh: my face feels like nettles!&quot; 
  She rubbed her cheeks with her two hands, and then held up one   hand to Philip. 
  &quot;Look,&quot; she said. &quot;It's as rough as sand-paper. Isn't that a   change? I didn't even wear gloves on the ship. I'm an enthusiast.  I'm  going down there with you, and I'm going to fight. Now have  you got  anything to say against me, Mr. Philip?&quot; 
  There was a lightness in her words, and yet not in her voice. In   her manner was an uneasiness, mingled with an almost childish   eagerness for him to answer, which Philip could not understand. He   fancied that once or twice he had caught the faintest sign of a  break  in her voice. 
  &quot;You really mean to hazard this adventure?&quot; he cried, softly, in   his astonishment. &quot;You, whom wild horses couldn't drag into the   wilderness, as you once told me!&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; she affirmed, drawing her stool back out of the increasing   heat of the fire. Her face was almost entirely in shadow now, and  she  did not look at Philip. &quot;I am beginning to&#8212;to love  adventure,&quot; she  went on, in an even voice. &quot;It was an adventure  coming up. And when we  landed down there something curious  happened. Did you see a girl who  thought that she knew me&#8212;&quot; 
  She stopped, and a sudden flash of the fire lit up her eyes, fixed   on him intently from between her shielding hands. 
  &quot;I saw her run out and speak to you,&quot; said Philip, his heart   beating at double-quick. He leaned over so that he was looking   squarely into Miss Brokaw's face. 
  &quot;Did you know her?&quot; she asked. 
  &quot;I have seen her only twice&#8212;once before she spoke to you.&quot; 
  &quot;If I meet her again I shall apologize,&quot; said Eileen. &quot;It was her   mistake, and she startled me. When she ran out to me like that,  and  held out her hands I&#8212;I thought of beggars.&quot; 
  &quot;Beggars!&quot; almost shouted Philip. &quot;A beggar!&quot; He caught himself   with a laugh, and to cover his sudden emotion turned to lay a  fresh  piece of birch on the fire. &quot;We don't have beggars up here.&quot; 
  The door opened behind them and Brokaw entered. Philip's face was   red when he greeted him. For half an hour after that he cursed   himself for not being as clever as Gregson. He knew that there was  a  change in Eileen Brokaw, a change which nature had not worked  alone,  as she wished him to believe. Then, and at supper, he tried  to fathom  her. At times he detected the metallic ring of what was  unreal and  make-believe in what she said; at other times she  seemed stirred by  emotions which added immeasurably to the  sweetness and truthfulness of  her voice. She was nervous. He found  her eyes frequently seeking her  father's face, and more than once  they were filled with a mysterious  questioning, as if within  Brokaw's brain there lurked hidden things  which were new to her,  and which she was struggling to understand. She  no longer held the  old fascination for Philip, and yet he conceded  that she was more  beautiful than ever. Until to-night he had never  seen the shadow  of sadness in her eyes; he had never seen them darken  as they  darkened now, when she listened with almost feverish interest  to  the words which passed between himself and Brokaw. He was certain   that it was not a whim that had brought her into the north. It was   impossible for him to believe that he had piqued at her vanity  until  she had leaped into action, as she had suggested to him  while they  were sitting before the fire. Could it be that she had  accompanied her  father because he&#8212;Philip Whittemore&#8212;was in the  north? 
  The thought drew a slow flush into his face, and his uneasiness   increased when he knew that she was looking at him. He was glad  when  it came time for cigars, and Eileen excused herself. He  opened the  door for her, and told her that he probably would not  see her again  until morning, as he had an important engagement for  the evening. She  gave him her hand, and for a moment he felt the  clinging of her  fingers about his own. 
  &quot;Good night,&quot; she whispered. 
  &quot;Good night.&quot; 
  She drew her hand half away, and then, suddenly, raised her eyes   straight to his own. They were calm, quiet, beautiful, and yet  there  came a quick little catch in her throat as she leaned so  close to him  that she touched his breast, and said: 
  &quot;It will be best&#8212;best for everything&#8212;everybody&#8212;if you can   influence father to stay at Fort Churchill.&quot; 
  She did not wait for him to reply, but hurried toward her room.   For a moment Philip stared after her in amazement. Then he took a   step as if to follow her, to call her back. The impulse left him  as  quickly as it came, and he rejoined Brokaw and the factor. 
  He looked at his watch. It was seven o'clock. At half-past seven   he shook hands with the two men, lighted a fresh cigar, and passed   out into the night. It was early for his meeting with Pierre and   Jeanne, but he went down to the shore and walked slowly in the   direction of the cliff. He was still an hour early when he arrived  at  the great rock, and sat down, with his face turned to the sea. 
  It was a white, radiant night, such as he had seen in the tropics.   Only here, in the north, his vision reached to greater distances.   Churchill lay lifeless in its pool of light; the ship hung like a   black silhouette in the distance, with a cloud of jet-black smoke   rising straight up from its funnels, and spreading out high up   against the sky, a huge, ebon monster that cast its shadow for  half a  mile over the Bay. The shadow held Philip's eyes. Now it  was like a  gigantic face, now like a monster beast&#8212;now it reached  out in the  form of a great threatening hand, as though somewhere  in the mystery  of the north it sought a spirit-victim as potent as  itself. 
  Then the spell of it was broken. From the end of the shadow, which   reached almost to the base of the cliff on which Philip sat, there   came a sound. It was a clear, metallic sound that left the  vibration  of steel in the air, and Philip leaned over the edge of  the rock.  Below him the shadow was broken into a pool of rippling  starlight. He  heard the faint dip of paddles, and suddenly a canoe  shot from the  shadow out into the clear light of the moon and  stars. 
  It was a large canoe. In it he could make out four figures. Three   of them were paddling; the fourth sat motionless in the bow. They   passed under him swiftly, guiding their canoe so that it was soon   hidden in the shelter of the cliff. By the faint reflections cast  by  the disturbed water, Philip saw that the occupants of the canoe  had  made an effort to conceal themselves by following the course  of the  dense shadow. Only the chance sound had led him to observe  them. 
  Under ordinary circumstances the passing of a strange canoe at   night would have had no significance for him. But at the present  time  it troubled him. The manner of its approach through the  shadow, the  strange quiet of its occupants, the stealth with which  they had shot  the canoe under the cliff, were all unusual. Could  the incident have  anything to do with Jeanne and Pierre? 
  He waited until he heard the tiny bell in his watch tinkle the   half-hour, and then he set out slowly over the moonlit rocks to  the  north. Jeanne and Pierre would surely come from that  direction. It was  impossible to miss them. He walked without sound  in his moccasins,  keeping close to the edge of the cliff so that  he could look out over  the Bay. Two or three hundred yards beyond  the big rock the sea-wall  swung in sharply, disclosing the open  water, like a still, silvery  sheet, for a mile or more. Philip  scanned it for the canoe, but as far  as he could see there was not  a shadow. 
  For a quarter of a mile he walked over the rocks, then returned.   It was nine o'clock. The moment had arrived for the appearance of   Jeanne and Pierre. He resumed his patrol of the cliff, and with  each  moment his nervousness increased. What if Jeanne failed him?  What if  she did not come to the rock? The mere thought made his  heart sink  with a sudden painful throb. Until now the fear that  Jeanne might  disappoint him, that she might not keep the tryst,  had not entered his  head. His faith in this girl, whom he had seen  but twice, was supreme. 
  A second and a third time he patrolled the quarter mile of cliff.   Again his watch tinkled the half-hour, and he knew that the last   minutes of the appointed time had come. 
  The third and last time he went beyond the quarter-mile limit,   searching in the white distances beyond. A low wind was rising  from  the Bay; it rustled in the spruce and balsam tops of the  forest that  reached up to the barren whiteness of the rock plateau  on which he  stood; under him he heard, growing more and more  distinct, the moaning  wash of the swelling tide. A moment of  despair possessed him, and he  felt that he had lost. 
  Suddenly the wind brought to him a different sound&#8212;a shout far   down the cliff, a second cry, and then the scream of a woman,   deadened by the wash of the sea and the increasing sweep of the  wind  among the trees. 
  He stood for a moment powerless, listening. The wind lulled, and   the woman's cry now came to him again&#8212;a voice that was filled  with  terror rising in a wild appeal for help. With an answering  shout he  ran like a swift-footed animal along the cliff. It was  Jeanne who was  calling! Who else but Jeanne would be out there in  the gray  night&#8212;Jeanne and Pierre? He listened as he ran, but  there came no  other sound. At last he stopped, and drew in a great  breath, to send  out a shout that would reach their ears. 
  Above the fierce beating of his heart, the throbbing intake of his   breath, he heard sounds which were not of the wind or the sea. He  ran  on, and suddenly the cliff dropped from under his feet, and he  found  himself on the edge of a great rift in the wall of rock,  looking  across upon a strange scene. In the brilliant moonlight,  with his back  against a rock, stood Pierre, his glistening rapier  in his hand, his  thin, lithe body bent for the attack of three men  who faced him. It  was but a moment's tableau. The men rushed in.  Muffled cries, blows, a  single clash of steel, and Pierre's voice  rose above the sound of  conflict. &quot;For the love of God, give me  help, M'sieur!&quot; He had seen  Philip rush up to the edge of the  break in the cliff, and as he fought  he cried out again. 
  &quot;Shoot, M'sieur! In a moment it will be too late!&quot; 
  Philip had drawn his heavy revolver. He watched for an   opportunity. The men were fighting now so that Pierre had been  forced  between his assailants and the breach in the wall. There  was no chance  to fire without hitting him. 
  &quot;Run, Pierre!&quot; shouted Philip. &quot;Run&#8212;&quot; 
  He fired once, over the heads of the fighters, and as Pierre   suddenly darted to one side in obedience to his command there came   for the first time a shot from the other side. The bullet whistled   close to his ears. A second shot, and Pierre fell down like one  dead  among the rocks. Again Philip fired&#8212;a third and a fourth  time, and  one of the three who were disappearing in the white  gloom stumbled  over a rock, and fell as Pierre had fallen. His  companions stopped,  picked him up, and staggered on with him.  Philip's last shot missed,  and before he could reload they were  lost among the upheaved masses of  the cliff. 
  &quot;Pierre!&quot; he called. &quot;Ho! Pierre Couchee!&quot; 
  There was no answer from the other side. 
  He ran along the edge of the break, and in the direction of the   forest he found a place where he could descend. In his haste he  fell;  his hands were scratched, blood flowed from a cut in his  forehead when  he dragged himself up to the face of the cliff  again. He tried to  shout when he saw a figure drag itself up from  among the rocks, but  his almost superhuman exertions had left him  voiceless. His wind  whistled from between his parted lips when he  came to Pierre. 
  Pierre was supporting himself against a rock. His face was   streaming with blood. In his hand he held what remained of the   rapier, which had broken off close to the hilt. His eyes were  blazing  like a madman's, and his face was twisted with an agony  that sent a  thrill of horror through Philip. 
  &quot;My hurt is nothing&#8212;nothing-M'sieur!&quot; he gasped, understanding   the look in Philip's face. &quot;It is Jeanne! They have gone&#8212;gone  with  Jeanne!&quot; The rapier slipped from his hand and he slid weakly  down  against the rock. Philip dropped upon his knees, and with his   handkerchief began wiping the blood from the half-breed's face.  For a  few moments Pierre's head hung limp against his shoulder. 
  &quot;What is it, Pierre?&quot; he urged. &quot;Tell me&#8212;quick! They have gone   with Jeanne!&quot; 
  Pierre's body grew rigid. With one great effort he seemed to   marshal all of his strength, and straightened himself. 
  &quot;Listen, M'sieur,&quot; he said, speaking calmly. &quot;They set upon us as   we were going to meet you at the rock. There were four. One of  them  is dead&#8212;back there. The others&#8212;with Jeanne&#8212;have gone in  the canoe.  It is death&#8212;worse than death&#8212;for her&#8212;&quot; 
  His body writhed. In a passion he strove to rise to his feet. Then   with a groan he sank back, and for a moment Philip thought he was   dying. 
  &quot;I will go, Pierre,&quot; he cried. &quot;I will bring her back. I swear   it.&quot; 
  Pierre's hand detained him as he went to rise. 
  &quot;You swear&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;At the next break&#8212;there is a canoe. They have gone for the   Churchill&#8212;&quot; 
  Pierre's voice was growing weaker. In a spasm of sudden fear at   the dizziness which was turning the night black for him he  clutched  at Philip's arm. 
  &quot;If you save her, M'sieur, do not bring her back,&quot; he whispered,   hoarsely. &quot;Take her to Fort o' God. Lose not an hour&#8212;not a  minute.  Trust no one. Hide yourselves. Fight&#8212;kill&#8212;but take her  to Fort o'  God! You will do this&#8212;M'sieur&#8212;you promise&#8212;&quot; 
  He fell back limp. Philip lowered him gently, holding his head so   that he could look into the staring eyes that were still open and   understanding. 
  &quot;I will go, Pierre,&quot; he said. &quot;I will take her to Fort o' God. And   you&#8212;&quot; 
  A shadow was creeping over Pierre's eyes. He was still fighting to   understand, fighting to hold for another breath or two the   consciousness that was fast slipping from him. 
  &quot;Listen,&quot; cried Philip, striving to rouse him. &quot;You will not die.   The bullet grazed your head, and the wound has already stopped   bleeding. To-morrow you must go to Churchill and hunt up a man  named  Gregson&#8212;the man I was with when you and Jeanne came to see  the ship.  Tell him that an important thing has happened, and that  he must tell  the others I have gone to the camps. He will  understand. Tell  him&#8212;tell him&#8212;&quot; 
  He struggled to find some final word for Gregson. Pierre still   looked at him, his eyes half closed now. 
  Philip bent close down. 
  &quot;Tell him,&quot; he said, &quot;that I am on the trail of Lord Fitzhugh!&quot; 
  Scarcely had he uttered the name when Pierre's closing eyes shot   open. A groaning cry burst from his lips, and, as if that name had   aroused the last spark of life and strength within him into  action,  he wrenched himself from Philip's arms, striving to speak.  A trickle  of fresh blood ran over his face. Incoherent sounds  rattled in his  throat, and then, overcome by his effort, he  dropped back unconscious.  Philip wound his handkerchief about the  wounded man's head and  straightened out his limbs. Then he rose to  his feet and reloaded his  revolver. His hands were steady now. His  brain was clear; the  enervating thrill of excitement had gone from  his body. Only his heart  beat like a racing engine. 
  He turned and ran in the direction which Pierre's assailants had   taken, his head lowered, his revolver held in front of him, on a   level with his breast. He had not gone a hundred yards when  something  stopped him. In his path, with its face turned straight  up to the  moonlit sky, lay the body of a man. For an instant  Philip bent over  it. The broken blade of Pierre's rapier glistened  under the man's  throat. One lifeless hand clutched at it, as  though in the last moment  of life he had tried to draw it forth.  The face was distorted, the  eyes were still open, the lips parted.  Death had come with terrible  suddenness. 
  Philip bent lower, and stared into the face of the dead man. Where   had he seen that face before? 
  Suddenly he remembered. He drew back, and a cold sweat seemed to   break out all at once over his face and body. This man who lay  with  the broken blade of Pierre Couchee's rapier in his breast had  come  ashore from the London ship that day in company with Eileen  and her  father! 
  For a space he was overwhelmed by the discovery. Everything that   had happened&#8212;the scene upon the rock when he first met Jeanne,  the  arrival of the ship, the moment's tableau on the pier when  Jeanne and  Eileen stood face to face&#8212;rushed upon him now as he  gazed down into  the staring eyes at his feet. What did it all  mean? Why had Lord  Fitzhugh's name been sufficient to drag the  half-breed back from the  brink of unconsciousness? What  significance was there in this strange  combination of  circumstances that persisted in drawing Pierre and  Jeanne into the  plot that threatened himself? Had there been truth,  after all, in  those last words that he impressed upon the fainting  senses of  Pierre Couchee's message to Gregson? 
  He waited to answer none of the questions that leaped through his   brain. To-morrow some one would find Pierre, or Pierre would crawl   down into Churchill. And then there would be the dead man to  account  for. He shuddered as he returned his revolver into his  holster and  braced his limbs. It was an unpleasant task, but he  knew that it must  be done&#8212;to save Pierre. He lifted the body  clear of the rocks, and  bending under its weight carried it to the  edge of the cliff. Far  below sounded the wash of the sea. He  shoved his burden over the edge,  and listened. After a moment  there came a dull splash. 
  Then he hastened on, as Pierre had guided him.
