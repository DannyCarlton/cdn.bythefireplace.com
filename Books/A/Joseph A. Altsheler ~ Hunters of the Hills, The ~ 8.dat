Captain Louis de Galisonniere proved to be a genial host, pleased with  his guests, pleased with himself, and pleased with the situation. Brave  and alert, he had also a certain amount of vanity which Robert had  tickled. It was not for nothing that he was a nephew of Count de  Galisonniere, once Governor General of Canada, rank and birth counting  for so much then with the French nation, and it was not for nothing,  either, that he had won his captaincy by valiant and diligent service of  his own. So it afforded him great satisfaction to be hospitable now, and  also to patronize slightly these men from the south, with whom in all  probability New France would be at war before another year had passed.  It was well also to impress the Onondaga, whom his vigilant mind  recognized at once as a youth of station. None knew better than de  Galisonniere the power and importance of the Iroquois, and how they  might tip the scale in a great war between the French and British  colonies.    
His boat, which he proudly called the <i>Frontenac</i>, after the early and  great Governor General of Canada, was equipped with supplies needed on  trips between ports on the St. Lawrence. After providing stools for his  guests, he offered them the light wine of France, even as de Courcelles  had done, but Robert and Tayoga declined, although Willet accepted a  glass.    
"We appreciate your courtesy," said Robert, "but we descendants of the  English in America do not take much to wine. I find that my head is much  better without it."    
"The intoxicating drinks of the white men are not good for the red  race," said Tayoga gravely. "The warriors of the Hodenosaunee are able  to fight anything else, but strong liquors take away their brains and  make them like little children who fly into passions over trifles."    
De Galisonniere looked with great interest at the young Onondaga, being  impressed by the dignity of his manner and the soberness of his speech.    
"You speak perfect English," he observed.    
"I learned it in a white man's school at Albany," said Tayoga. "Lennox  was my comrade there, just as he has been in the woods."    
"You will see a much greater town than Albany when you arrive at Quebec.  You will see a noble city, on a noble site, an impregnable fortress,  guarded by the most valiant troops in the world. For its like you would  have to cross the sea to our old land of France."    
"I have heard much of Stadacona, which you call Quebec," said Tayoga,  without any alteration of tone. "Our old men speak often of it, when it  belonged to our brethren, the Ganeagaono, known to you as the Mohawks,  who never sold or ceded it to anybody."    
De Galisonniere's face fell a little, but he recovered himself quickly.    
"That was generations ago," he said, "and time makes many shifts and  changes. There is a flux and efflux of all people, including the white,  like the ceaseless movement of sand upon a beach."    
The Onondaga was silent, but Robert saw that he did not unbend, and de  Galisonniere, feeling that it was unwise to pursue the topic, turned his  attention to the mighty river and its lofty wooded banks.    
"I don't believe there's another river in the world the equal of this  giant French stream of ours," he said.    
"Our noble British river, the Hudson, has much to say for itself," said  Robert.    
"A grand river, in truth. I have seen it, but large and splendid as it  is it lacks the length and size of the St. Lawrence."    
"It is beyond question a noble stream to travel on. One makes greater  speed here and suffers less hardship than in the forest."    
"I am glad that I can take you to Montreal."    
"Your hospitality to us, Captain de Galisonniere, is appreciated. I have  found French officers courteous and ready to share with us all they had.  You are not the first whom we have met on this journey. We encountered  far down in our province of New York the Chevalier Raymond de St. Luc."    
"St. Luc! St. Luc! The very flower of French chivalry! He is a relative  of the famous La Corne de St. Luc, of whom you have doubtless heard, and  at Quebec he is considered a model of all the qualities that make a  soldier and a gentleman."    
"He made a like impression upon me. Farther north we were so fortunate  as to meet more of your countrymen, Colonel de Courcelles and Captain de  Jumonville."    
"I know them both! Brave officers!" said de Galisonniere.    
But he turned away the conversation from the Frenchmen who had gone down  into territory that Robert considered a portion of the Province of New  York, and the lad surmised that, knowing a good deal about the nature of  their errands, he feared lest he might reveal something through chance  allusions. Instead, he talked of the St. Lawrence, Montreal, and the  glories of Quebec to which he hoped he might return soon. He addressed  most of his talk to Robert, but he spoke at times to Willet and Tayoga,  both of whom responded briefly. The wind meanwhile remained strong, and  it was not necessary to use the oars, the large sail carrying them  swiftly toward Montreal. Robert, while talking with de Galisonniere,  watched eagerly the two shores, seeing the smoke rise from the stout log  houses of the Canadians, and once the tall steeple of a church  dominating a little village, and seeming out of all proportion to the  congregation that surrounded it.    
"Yes, the church is very powerful with us," said de Galisonniere,  following his eyes and noting his expression. "It suits our people,  particularly our good Canadian French. Our priests are patriotic, brave,  self-sacrificing, and are a power in our dealings with the Indians."    
"I know it," said Robert.    
At night they reached Montreal, then much inferior in size and  importance to Quebec, the canoe was lifted from the <i>Frontenac</i>, and  after many exchanges of courtesies, the three went to an inn.    
"If chance offers," said Robert, "we shall be glad to help you as you  have helped us."    
"One never knows," said de Galisonniere. "You and I need not conceal  from each other that there is much talk of war between England and  France, which, of course, would mean war also between the English and  French colonies. If it comes, and come it will, I think, I trust that no  ill luck will befall you upon the battlefield."    
"And I wish you as well," said Robert, sincerely.    
The canoe was left in trustworthy hands, it being their purpose to sell  it on the morrow and buy a larger boat, and they walked through the  streets of this town of Hochelaga toward their inn. There were other  Indians on the street--French Indians they were called to distinguish  them from those who formed a British alliance--but none could be  compared with Tayoga, arrayed in the full splendor of a coming chief of  the clan of the Bear, of the nation Onondaga, of the League of the  Hodenosaunee. Never had he borne himself more haughtily, never had his  height appeared greater or his presence grander. Robert, looking at him,  felt that if St. Luc was the very flower of French chivalry, this young  comrade of his was to an even greater degree the very spirit and  essence of all that was best in the great League of the Hodenosaunee.    
The Indians--Hurons, Abenakis, St. Regis, Ottawas, and warriors from  farther west--watched Tayoga with fascinated eyes. They knew perfectly  well who the tall youth was, that he belonged to the great Iroquois  league, and they knew, too, in their secret hearts that he had the  superiority which Onondaga, Mohawk and their allied nations claimed.  Hence, while their looks sometimes expressed an unwilling admiration,  they were also charged always with hostility and hate. But Tayoga  apparently took no notice. Once more he was the Greek to whom all outer  peoples were barbarians.    
"I don't think the French can make much progress with him," whispered  Willet to Robert. "As the Indian has no written language, his memory is  long. When we reach Quebec he'll never forget for an instant that it was  once Stadacona, a village of the Mohawks, the Keepers of the Eastern  Gate, and one of the great nations of the Hodenosaunee."    
"No, he will not," said Robert, "and look who is waiting to meet us!"    
Standing before a low house, which was crowded with the goods of a fur  trader, were a half-dozen Indians, wild and savage in looks to the last  degree, and in the center was one whose shoulder was bound tightly with  a great roll of deerskin. In stature he rose far above the other  warriors, and he had a thickness in proportion. The hate that the rest  had shown when they looked upon Tayoga was nothing to his, which was  the very concentrated essence of all malice.    
"Our good friend, Tandakora, despite his wound seems to have arrived  ahead of us," said Willet to Robert.    
"Yes, and he shows very clearly that he would like to give Tayoga to the  torture with himself as torturer, and yet he must know that it was you  who put the bullet through his shoulder."    
"Quite true, Robert, but he resents the Onondaga more than he does us.  We are strangers, aliens to him, and he makes no comparisons with us,  but Tayoga is an Indian like himself, whom he has fought against, and  against whom he has failed. Watch us pass. For Tayoga, Tandakora will  not exist, and it will instill more poison into the heart of the  Ojibway."    
Willet was a good prophet. The Onondaga walked within five feet of the  Ojibway, but he did not show by the slightest sign that he was aware of  the existence of Tandakora. The entire little drama, played by the  children of the forest, was perfectly clear. Tandakora was dirt under  the feet of Tayoga, and Tandakora felt that it was so. His heart burned  within him and a twinge through his shoulder added to his anger. Yet he  was powerless there in Montreal with the French troops about, and he  could merely glare impotently while the three walked by ignoring his  existence. But they did not forget him, and each in his heart resolved  to be on watch against treacherous attack.    
They found on the slope of a high hill the inn to which de Galisonniere  had recommended them, and obtained quarters for the night. Monsieur  Jolivet, the proprietor, had lodged Indians before, great chiefs  treating with the French Government, and he did not think it strange  that Tayoga should come there. In truth, Monsieur Jolivet was a thrifty  man who despised no patronage for which the pay was assured, and since  peace still existed between France and Great Britain he was quite  willing to entertain any number of Bostonnais at his most excellent inn  on the slope of a high hill overlooking the St. Lawrence. Willet had  shown him the color of gold, and from natural ability and long  experience as an innkeeper being a shrewd reader of faces he was sure  that his three unusual guests could be trusted.    
Willet knew Canada better than Robert, and now he acted as spokesman.    
"We will sleep here only one night," he said, "because early tomorrow  morning we take boat for Quebec. We three will occupy one large room.  You have such a room with three beds, have you not?"    
"I have the room," responded Monsieur Jolivet promptly, "and the beds  can be put in it at once. Then all will be arranged quickly by Lizette  and Marie, the maids. Will you permit my man, Francois, to carry your  weapons to the chamber now?"    
"I think not," replied Willet, giving his rifle an affectionate look.  "I've lived so long with this good old rifle of mine that we hate to be  parted even for an hour. Tayoga and Mr. Lennox are younger than I am,  but they're beginning to feel the same way about their arms. If you  don't mind, Monsieur Jolivet, we'll keep our weapons with us."    
"Ah, I see, sir, that you're a man of sentiment," said Monsieur Jolivet,  laughing and rubbing his hands. "It is well that one can feel it in this  rough world of ours. But will Monsieur see a young officer who has come  from the commandant? Merely a little inquiry about your identity and an  examination of your papers, if you have any. It's according to our  custom, and it's just a formality, nothing more."    
Robert knew that it was far from being a formality, but his comrades and  he had nothing to fear, as their mission was duly accredited and they  carried the letters to the Marquis Duquesne. The young officer, a  Frenchman of Canadian birth, entered presently, and with the courtesy  characteristic of the French race, a trait that Robert liked, asked for  an account of themselves, which was given readily. As usual the effect  of the letters addressed to the Marquis Duquesne was magical, and, as  the officer withdrew, he tendered them all the help he could give for a  speedy and pleasant voyage to Quebec.    
Monsieur Jolivet gave them a supper in his best style. Although a native  of New France he was of Provencal blood, and he had a poetic strain. He  offered to his guests not an excellent inn alone, but a magnificent view  also, of which he made full use. The evening being warm with a soft and  soothing wind, Marie and Lizette set the table in a little garden, in  which early flowers were blooming already, offering delicate colors of  pink and rose and pale blue. The table was spread with a white cloth,  and silver and china were not lacking. The eyes of Robert, who had a  fastidious taste, glistened.    
"Monsieur Jolivet may be our enemy or not," he said, "but I like him. It  is not often that one can dine at such an inn, with such a view of  mountain, forest and magnificent river. In truth, the French do some  things well."    
"They surpass us in the matter of inns," said Willet. "They think more  about it--and take more trouble. I'm sorry we have to quarrel with the  French. They're good people, though they haven't been oversqueamish in  the use of savages against us, and they're really responsible for the  cruelties done by the painted demons."    
He spoke freely of red "savages" before Tayoga, knowing that the young  Onondaga would never think of applying the word to himself. Willet had  shown too often that he considered the people of the Hodenosaunee the  equals of anybody. Then he took their three rifles, laid them together  on the grass by the side of a graveled walk and, looking at the vast  expanse of mountain, forest and river, drew a deep breath.    
"It's not much like fighting for our lives back there in the gorge, is  it, Robert?" he asked. "It's a strange world here in America. We're  lying in a rocky hollow one day, shooting at people who are shooting at  us, and both sides shooting to kill, and two or three days later we're  sitting at an inn in a town, eating off silver and china."    
"It's a quick and pleasant transformation," said Robert,  appreciatively.    
He would have called it supper, but in Montreal it was dinner, and it  was served by Lizette and Marie. There was fish from the St. Lawrence,  chicken, beef, many vegetables, good white bread and coffee, all  prepared in the excellent manner characteristic of Monsieur Jolivet's  famous inn. Tayoga ate abundantly but delicately. He had learned the use  of knife and fork at the school in Albany, and, like Robert, he was  fastidious at the table.    
Monsieur Jolivet, after his manner, gave them much of his own presence.  One must be polite to the Bostonnais at such a time. He discoursed quite  freely of Montreal, and of its advantages as a great trading post with  the Indians, who already brought there vast quantities of furs. It would  become one of the greatest and most brilliant jewels in the French  crown, second perhaps only to Paris. But for the present, the chief  glory of New France could be seen only at Quebec Ah, when the Bostonnais  arrived there they would behold great lords and great ladies!    
The three listened, each interested in his own way. Robert's fancy saw  the silken splendor of a vice-regal court, and, anxious to know the  larger world, he was more glad than ever that he had come upon this  errand, dangerous though it had proved to be.    
They sat a while after the dinner was over, looking down at the town and  the great view beyond, a clear moon and brilliant stars casting a silver  light which illuminated almost like the day. They saw lights gleaming  in houses, and now and then shadowy figures passing. Out in the river a  boat with a mast rocked in the current, and Robert believed it was the  <i>Frontenac</i> of Louis de Galisonniere.    
As the dusk thickened over the great river, the island, the hills and  the forest, Hochelaga seemed very small, and the inn of the excellent  Monsieur Jolivet was just a tiny point of light in all that vast  darkness. It shone, nevertheless, by contrast, and was a little island  of warmth and comfort in the sea of the wilderness. Monsieur Jolivet,  who was deeply interested in the Bostonnais and the proud young  Iroquois, talked freely. Under his light and chattering manner lay great  powers of perception, and he saw that he had guests of quality, each in  his own way. The hunter even was not an ordinary hunter, but, as  Monsieur Jolivet judged, a man of uncommon intellectual power, and also  of education. He would discover as much about them as he could, for his  own personal gratification, because he might give valuable information  to the commandant at Montreal, who was his friend, and because later on  he might speak a useful word or two in the ear of Louis de Galisonniere,  whom he knew well and whose good opinion he valued.    
Robert, who was in a cheerful mood and who wished to exercise his gift  of golden speech, met him half way, and enlarged upon the splendor and  power of Britain, the great kingdom that bestrode the Atlantic, seated  immovable in Europe, and yet spreading through her colonies in America,  increasing and growing mightier all the time. It was soon a test of  eloquence between him and Monsieur Jolivet, in which each was seeking  to obtain from the other an expression of the opinion that swayed his  country. The Onondaga was silent, and the hunter spoke only a word or  two, but each listened intently to the dialogue, which, however earnest  it might be, never went beyond the bounds of good humor.    
"I cannot make you see the truth," said Monsieur Jolivet, at last,  smiling and spreading his hands. "I cannot convince you that France is  the first of nations, the nation of light and learning and humanity, and  yet it is so. And seated here upon the St. Lawrence we shall build up  another France, the New France of America, which will shed light upon  you English or Bostonnais down below, and teach you the grace and beauty  of civilization."    
"We should be willing to learn from any who can teach us," said Robert,  "and such a willingness I claim is a chief merit of us English who are  born in America, or Bostonnais, as you would call us."    
Monsieur Jolivet once more spread out his hands in deprecation.    
"We argue in vain," he said. "But now Lizette comes with the coffee,  which is one of the most glorious triumphs of my inn. Does the young  chief drink coffee?"    
"Yes," replied Robert, "he learned at Albany all the white man's  habits."    
After the coffee they rose from the table and mine host prepared to show  them to their room. The darkness had thickened meanwhile and glimpses of  the river and the hills were faint. The little garden was enclosed by  three walls of darkness, being lighted on the side where it joined the  inn. Yet Robert thought he saw a shifting figure blacker than the  shadows in which it moved.    
Marie and Lizette took away the silver and china and Monsieur Jolivet  went ahead to show them to their room. Then something whistled in the  darkness, and an arrow buried to the head of the barb stood out in the  rear wall of the inn. The three seized their rifles, but the darker  shadow in the shadows was gone. Tayoga broke off the arrow level with  the wall, and threw the shaft into the garden.    
"It was Tandakora," he said, "seeking revenge. But since the arrow has  sped wrong he will not loose another shaft tonight. If it had not been  for his wounded shoulder the arrow might have gone true. It was a  treacherous deed, worthy of the savage Ojibway."    
"I hope the time will come," said Willet, "when I shall send a bullet  not through Tandakora's shoulder, but through his heart. I don't love  the shedding of blood, but the forest will be a better forest without  him. Meanwhile, say nothing, lads. Monsieur Jolivet is coming back, but  don't mention the arrow to him. He may find the head of it later on in  the wall, and then he can wonder about it as much as he pleases."    
Mine host bustled back. The foul and treacherous attempt, the breaking  off of the arrow, and the comment upon it had taken less than a minute,  and, good observer though he was, he noticed nothing unusual in the  appearance of his guests. They carried their rifles in their hands, but  many visitors to Montreal did the same, and as they were beautiful  weapons they might well guard against their loss.    
"Follow me, my Bostonnais," he said lightly. "I have the great room with  three beds for you, and I trust that you have enjoyed the dinner."    
"We have enjoyed it greatly, all of it, Monsieur Jolivet, and especially  the dessert," replied Robert with meaning.    
"Ah, the pastry," said Monsieur Jolivet, clasping his hands. "It is  Marie who made it. It is the gift that she has, and I shall tell her of  your praise."    
But Robert was not thinking of the pastry. It was of the arrow that he  spoke as dessert, although the excellent Monsieur Jolivet was destined  never to know the hidden significance of his words. The room which he  showed them with so much pride was a large apartment worthy of their  praise, having a polished, shining floor of oak, with furs spread here  and there upon it, and a low ceiling crossed with mighty beams also of  oak. Robert looked at the windows, three in number, and he saw with  satisfaction that they had heavy shutters. Monsieur Jolivet's glance  followed his own, and he said:    
"The shutters are for use in the winter, when the great colds come, and  the fierce winds rage. But you, messieurs, who live so much in the  forest, will, of course, prefer to keep them wide open tonight."    
Robert murmured assent, but when Monsieur Jolivet departed, wishing  them a polite good night, he looked at his comrades.    
"We are used to air," said Willet, "and lots of it, but those shutters  will be closed until morning. As Tayoga truly said, he will hardly dare  another arrow, but we mustn't take any risk, however small."    
Tayoga nodded approval, and drawing the shutters close, they fastened  them. Then they undressed and lay down upon their beds, but each  prepared to sleep with his rifle beside him.    
"The catches on those shutters are good and strong," said Willet, "and  Tandakora, even if he should come again, won't try to break them. It  wouldn't suit the purposes of the French for a warrior of a tribe allied  with them to be caught trying to murder English visitors, and, that  being the case, I expect to go to sleep soon and sleep well."    
He was as good as his word. Robert, who blew out the candle, soon heard  his regular breathing. Tayoga, who was used to rooms, the Iroquois  themselves having strong log houses, quickly followed him in slumber,  but young Lennox was not able to compose his nerves for a little while.  He was perhaps more sensitive and imaginative than his comrades, or the  close air may have kept him awake. He could not help feeling that  Tandakora was outside trying the fastenings of the shutters, and at last  rising, he walked on tiptoe and listened at every window in turn. He  heard nothing without but the breathing of the gentle wind, and then,  knowing that it had been only his vivid fancy, he went back to bed and  slept soundly.    
"Wake up, Robert, and breathe this air! After our having been sealed up  in a room all night the breeze is heavenly."    
The shutters were thrown back, and the hunter and Tayoga, fully dressed,  stood by the windows. The air, fresh, life-giving, coming over the great  forests and the mighty river, was pouring into the room in streams, and  Tayoga and Willet were facing it, in order that they might receive it  straight upon their foreheads. Robert joined them, and soon felt as if  he had been created anew and stronger.    
"I'll never again sleep in a room closed tight and hard," said Willet,  "not even to protect my life. I've roamed the free woods for so many  years that I think another such experience would make me choke to  death."    
"I'm not in love with it myself," said Robert, "but it makes the world  outside look all the grander and all the more beautiful."    
At their wish breakfast was served for them by Monsieur Jolivet in the  garden, Willet insisting that for the present he could not stay any  longer in a house. Robert from his seat could see the end of the broken  barb embedded in the wall, but neither mine host nor any of his  assistants had yet noticed it.    
Monsieur Jolivet was pleased that they should have such a brilliant day  to begin their journey to Quebec, and he was telling them where they  could sell their canoe and buy a good boat when Louis de Galisonniere  appeared in the garden and presented them the compliments of the  morning. He looked so trim and so gay that he brought with him a  cheerful breeze, and the three felt the effect of it, although they  wondered at the nature of his errand there. Robert invited him to join  them at breakfast and he accepted their invitation, taking a roll and  butter and a cup of coffee after the French custom which even then  prevailed.    
"I see that you've slept well," he said, "and that the inn of Monsieur  Jolivet is as kind to the Bostonnais as it is to the French and the  Canadians."    
"Its hospitality to us could be no finer if we came from Paris itself,  instead of the Province of New York," said Robert. "Our stay in Canada  has been short, but most interesting."    
Monsieur Jolivet had gone into the inn, and de Galisonniere said:    
"Montreal is a fine town and I would not depreciate it in the presence  of our host, but as I have told you before, our Quebec to which you are  going is the true glory of New France. My knowledge that you're going  there is the reason why I've come here this morning."    
"How is that?" asked Robert    
"Because I received orders last night to depart in the <i>Frontenac</i> for  Quebec, a journey that I undertake with great willingness, since it  takes me where I wish to go. I have also the authority of the commandant  to ask your presence as guests for the voyage on board my vessel. Until  we French and you English actually go to war we might as well be  friends."    
Robert glanced at Tayoga and Willet and they nodded slightly. Then he  replied warmly that they accepted the invitation and would go with much  pleasure in the <i>Frontenac</i>. After breakfast they sold the canoe and  embarked presently, having first said goodby to Monsieur Jolivet, who  with his best napkin, waved them farewell.    
Robert was more than pleased at their good luck. The <i>Frontenac</i> offered  them a better passage than any boat they could buy and have to row  perhaps with their own strength. Moreover, they were already on  excellent terms with de Galisonniere, and it would be a good thing for  them to arrive at Quebec in his company.    
A strong wind was blowing, and the <i>Frontenac</i> moved swiftly over the  surface of the great stream which was like liquid green glass that  morning. The three had put their weapons, including Tayoga's bow and  arrows, in the cabin, and they sat on deck with de Galisonniere, who  looked with pride at the magnificent river which was the very artery of  life in the New France of the chevaliers. Robert's own heart throbbed as  he knew that this last stage of their journey would take them to famous  Quebec.    
"If the St. Lawrence didn't freeze over for such a long period," said de  Galisonniere, "this region would become in time the greatest empire in  the world."    
"But isn't that a huge 'if'?" asked Robert, laughing.    
De Galisonniere smiled.    
"It is," he said, "but New France is the chief jewel in the French  crown, nevertheless. In time the vice-regal court at Quebec will rule an  empire greater than that of France itself. Think of the huge lakes, the  great rivers, the illimitable forests, beyond them the plains over which  the buffalo herds roam in millions, and beyond them, so they say, range  on range of mountains and forests without end."    
"I have been thinking of them," said Robert, "but I've been thinking of  them in a British way."    
De Galisonniere laughed again and then grew serious.    
"It's natural," he said, "that you should think of them in a British  way, while I think of them in a French way. I suppose we shall have war,  Mr. Lennox, but doesn't it seem strange that England and France should  fight about American territory, when there's so much of it? Here's a  continent that civilized man cannot occupy for many generations. Both  England and France could be hidden away in its forests, and it would  take explorers to find them, and yet we must fight over a claim to  regions that we cannot occupy."    
Robert decided then that he liked young de Galisonniere very much. Some  such thoughts had been passing through his own mind, and he was glad  that he could talk frankly about the coming war with one who would be on  the other side, one who would be an official but not a personal enemy.  As the <i>Frontenac</i> slid on through the tumbling green current they  talked earnestly. Willet, sitting near, glanced at them occasionally,  but he too had plenty of thoughts of his own, while Tayoga, saying  nothing, gazed at the high green southern shore. This, so the old men  said, had once been the land of the Mohawks, one of the great nations  of the Hodenosaunee, and now the children of Onontio, who had come with  firearms against bows and arrows, spoke of it as theirs since Manitou  first made the land rise from the deep. Tayoga was silent but he had  many thoughts, and they were thoughts that came to him often and stayed  long.    
"De Courcelles and Jumonville, whom you met in the forest," said de  Galisonniere, at length, "arrived in Montreal early last night, and  after a stay of only two or three hours sailed in a schooner for  Quebec."    
"Did you see them at all while they were in Montreal?" asked Robert, who  seemed to detect significance in the young Frenchman's tone.    
"Only for a few moments," replied de Galisonniere, and Robert, judging  that he wished to avoid more talk on the subject, made no further  reference to de Courcelles. But the knowledge that he had gone on ahead  to Quebec troubled him. De Courcelles was not so young and frank as de  Galisonniere, nor did he seem to have the fine soul and chivalric spirit  of St. Luc. Robert felt the three had cause to fear him.    
But the journey down the St. Lawrence continued without serious delay,  although the wind failed now and then and they took to the oars. It was  a voyage full of variety and interest to Robert. He slept that night  with his comrades on the deck of the <i>Frontenac</i>, and the next morning  he found a strong wind again blowing.    
In time they approached Quebec, and saw the increasing signs of  population that betokened proximity to what was then in the eyes of  North Americans a great capital. On either shore they saw the manor  houses of the seigneurs, solid stone structures, low, steep of roof and  gabled, with clustering outhouses, and often a stone mill near by. The  churches also increased in numbers, and at one point the <i>Frontenac</i>  stopped and took on a priest, a tall strongly built man of middle years,  with a firm face. De Galisonniere introduced him as Father Philibert  Drouillard, and Robert felt his penetrating gaze upon his face. Then it  shifted to Willet and Tayoga, resting long upon the Onondaga.    
Robert, knowing the great power of the church in Canada, was curious  about Father Drouillard, whom he knew at once to be no ordinary man. His  lean ascetic face seemed to show the spirit that had marked Jogues and  Goupil and those other early priests whom no danger nor Indian torture  could daunt. But he was too polite to ask questions, feeling that time  would bring him all the information he wanted, in which he was right, as  de Galisonniere said later in the day when Father Drouillard was sitting  in the little cabin out of hearing:    
"A man of influence at Quebec. He has no parish, nor seems to wish any,  but he is deep in the councils of the Church. It is known, too, that he  corresponds with Rome, with the Holy Father himself, 'tis said, and  there are men high in office at Quebec who wish that he might be called  from New France back to the old land. Francois Bigot, the Intendant,  does not love him, nor does anyone of the group about Bigot, neither his  commissary general, Cadet, nor Pean, the Town Mayor of Quebec, nor  Descheneaux, nor the others of that group. It's a gorgeous life that our  own court circle leads at Quebec, and at the great Chateau Bigot, in the  midst of its walks and flowers and gardens. I don't know why I'm telling  you these things, Mr. Lennox! It seems they should be the very last to  say to one's official enemy, but I can't feel that I'm doing anything  wrong when I do tell them to you."    
His bright face was in gloom for a few moments, and Robert, quick in  perception, had a sudden feeling that this brilliant Quebec, enveloped  in so much color and glamour, might not be so sound within as the  English towns to the south, despite their wrangling. But it merely  increased his anxiety to see Quebec. Life would be all the more complex  there.    
The great river spread before them, blue now under a dazzling blue sky,  and the stout <i>Frontenac</i> left a long white trailing wake. A stone  house, larger than usual, showed through the green foliage on the south  bank. Father Drouillard gazed at it, and his face darkened. Presently he  arose and shook his hand towards the house, as if he were delivering a  curse.    
"The chateau that you see belongs to the young Count Jean de Mezy, a  friend of the Intendant, Bigot. Sometimes they come from their revels at  Beaumanoir to the Chateau de Mezy, and continue them there. Now you can  see why Father Drouillard, who sympathizes with our <i>honnetes gens</i>,  delivers his malediction."    
The priest returned to his seat, and averted his face. An hour later the  mighty rock of Quebec rose before them.
