  There were at least seven Lake Erie ports that might have claimed   Captain Kidd as a citizen, for the reason that this unusual individual   was a frequenter of them all, though he owned property in none. In   these seven towns there were seven thousand or more people who could   have pointed out Captain Kidd on sight, but it is doubtful if there   were more than seven who could truthfully have said that they were   personally acquainted with the man and his ship, especially the ship,   and not one of these could have sworn as to Captain Kidd's method of   making a livelihood. Some thought that he carried sand. Others were of   the opinion that his ship was a tramp. And a few, very few, winked in   a peculiarly non-committal way when the subject was raised, as is the   habit of old lakemen in doubt. But the people of busy lakeports are   too deeply absorbed during the months of navigation to prod into   another man's business unless there are dollars and cents at the   bottom of it, and as a result the skipper of the Lauraline Spreckles,   abbreviated the Laura Spreck by her master and owner, was allowed to   seek his ways in undisturbed peace. 
  That disinclination to investigate on the part of people who found   making a living to be a rather difficult undertaking at best explains   why it was that Jim Falkner had become a coal passer on Captain Kidd's   ship during the summer following his graduation from High School.   After all, it wasn't the business of any one in particular to warn an   orphan boy,&#8212;especially when no one knew for certain that any danger   was to be anticipated. 
  Their habit of minding their own business exclusively was properly   appreciated by Captain Kidd, who frequently gave thanks, therefore, to   the Providence which guided his fortunes. On the other side of the   lake, where in a bleak stretch of the Canadian shore terminated the   famous underground railway which began in Peking, Hong-Kong and   Shanghai, Captain Kidd was reputed to have done things which would   have won him a life of considerable monotony, if Uncle Sam had known.   This, too, was a fact properly digested by the cheerful adventurer.   Meanwhile he continued to smuggle Chinamen and now and then a Chinese   girl. 
  This afternoon Captain Kidd was in a more reflective mood than  usual.  Ostensibly he was taking up sand. The Laura Spreck lay  three-quarters  of a mile off a barren stretch of Ontario dunes and  marshes, over  which the day was fading away in fiery sunset. Back of  him the grey  rib-line of Point Pelee trembled like a thread of desert  sand in the  haze that was shifting seaward from the marshes of Pigeon  Bay. This  rib-line, which reminded him of the slim white forefinger of  a lady's  hand, was indissolubly associated with the fortunes of  Captain Kidd.  Among its barren drifts he had added to his sins; in its  loneliness he  had piled up the hoard of gold which no man knew but  himself. To him  it was the visible end of the underground. That  mysterious chain of  human mechanisms might begin almost anywhere  outside the country of  which he was a subject, but it ended there.  From that point the  yellow-skinned contraband came to him, and as he  half dreamed now in  watching its thin outline, he thought of the  secrets that it held for  him. From it he had taken Hop Lee, a cousin  of Mock Duck, who had paid  five thousand dollars to the head agent for  his relative's  importation. Hop Lee had taken up with his famous  cousin's life in San  Francisco, and presently had become one of the  most proficient  murderers in his tong. Then there was honest &quot;Joe&quot;  Tung, who now owned  three laundries in Buffalo, and who annually sent  him a present of  fifty dollars because of prosperity and gratitude;  and there were two  score or more others of whom he had lost all  account. Now and then  there had been a girl, but he could only wonder  where these had gone,  and each time one of them came to him through  the underground his  rough heart ached with sympathy. 
  It was a girl he was waiting for now. For weeks Captain Kidd had  been  working up an interest in her. There were certain reasons why he  had  come to anticipate the time when he would see Ah Ho, as she was  named  to him in his instructions. In the first place, he was  interested in  her story. Ah Ho, a letter from the agent at Hong-Kong  had told him,  was one of Canton parents. Her father was an official of  some dignity  in a small town, and Ah Ho, he stated at some length, was  very  beautiful, for which reason the underground charged a big price  for  her importation. A dozen years before, when her father needed  money in  order to achieve a certain ambition, the girl had been  disposed of to  a wealthy and aged Chicago Chinaman named Tai Sing, and  after giving  her an opportunity to grow up, Tai Sing was now claiming  her. A copy  of the cable-message from Hong-Kong stated that she had  sailed on the  Star of the Orient, and still later advice assured  Captain Kidd that  she had arrived safely in Vancouver. After that she  had been passed  like a precious parcel along the underground. The head  agent in  Montreal had reported that Ah Ho was in the city. The latest  despatch  read, &quot;Embarked in regular channel, Friday, six p.m.&quot; This  was Friday.  It was five-thirty p.m. If all had gone well, a signal of  Ah Ho's  presence would be shown among the sand-dunes within the next  thirty  minutes. Arousing himself from his restless contemplation of  the  shore, Captain Kidd swung down among his men. His strong thin face  was  now lit up with eager anticipation. He bared his large teeth in a   cheerful smile as he nodded to Stetson, the greybeard engineer.   Stetson grinned joyfully, and hurried off to his engines. Jim Falkner   followed him with the genuine enthusiasm of all adventurers under   twenty. There were two men left; old Grimmsey, the wheelman, whose   boast was that he could walk his ship in and out of corners of Lake   Erie blindfolded, and Watts, the mate. 
  &quot;We'll have to pull in pretty close to see the signal, Watts,&quot;   announced the captain. &quot;I think it'll come from the edge of the   marshes.&quot; 
  He went with Grimmsey into the wheel-house, and the electric bell  down  in the engine-room tinkled his orders to Stetson. Over the bow of  the  Laura Spreck he watched Pelee's rib-line of sand as it broadened  out  under his advance. The sun had now reached the water-rim. In its  last  glow the shore burned for a few minutes more brilliantly than  before,  and the wind-swept tops of the sand-dunes reflected the light  as  though each were capped with a million infinitesimal mirrors. 
  In this interval, when half of the bay was losing itself in the  gloom  of the evening, a carriage toiled slowly up over the backbone of  the  point and for a moment stood motionless on its crest, silhouetted  in  black against the glow of the western sky. Captain Kidd leaned out   eagerly. He strained his eyes for a signal, and fingered word down to   Stetson to stop the engines. As he looked, three men sprang from the   carriage, and he caught the glint of rifle barrels in their hands.   They threw themselves upon their faces, and sent a fusillade of shots   over the sand-ridge. In another instant the carriage was tearing down   to the beach, and while the captain of the smuggler still leaned over   the edge of the wheel-house and stared, his face tense, his breath   coming quickly, the three men rose against the sky-line and raced   after the horses. 
  Captain Kidd turned for the space in which one might flip an  eyelash.  That lightning glance assured him that toward the open lake  the way  was clear. When he turned again to the tragedy ashore the  carriage had  come down to the edge of the water. It had plunged in to  the hubs, and  as the frightened horses reared in the surf a boat shot  out toward the  fugitives from the reeds of the marsh. Then again the  sky-line was  broken, this time by a horseman. Two of the three  riflemen were  waiting for him on bended knee, and even before the  reports of their  rifles sounded in Captain Kidd's ears the pursuer  lurched from his  saddle and fell upon the sand, where he lay  motionless blot. Two  female figures jumped from the carriage into the  water, and waded out  to meet the approaching boat. Close after them  came the armed  fugitives, and barely had they scrambled over the side  of the craft  when half a dozen horsemen tore over the sand-ridge. 
  Captain Kidd heaved a deep sigh as he faced Grimnisey. The hardness   had gone out of his face. &quot;A close shave,&quot; he breathed. &quot;A damned   close shave, Grim!&quot; 
  Five minutes later the boat ran alongside, and Captain Kidd  recognized  the chief matron of the underground in her bow. He had met  this woman  many times, and when he carried female passengers she  always  accompanied him. She called up to him now from the gloom  gathering  under the starboard bow. 
  &quot;You'll have to take us all, Captain Kidd,&quot; she cried. 
  &quot;Certainly, Miss Moore,&quot; replied the captain. &quot;Come aboard, all of   you. I'll land you gentlemen a few miles down the shore. Of course you   understand that under ordinary circumstances I never allow a man on my   deck&#8212;unless he's a passenger.&quot; 
  &quot;A Chinaman he means,&quot; explained the matron with emphasis. As she  came  over the side of the ship she whispered low: 
  &quot;They discovered our movements in Montreal, Captain. We didn't know  it  until the last moment, and then we thought we could beat them out.  It  will be surprising if we don't have a revenue cutter at our heels   before long.&quot; 
  Somebody lifted up Ah Ho, and Captain Kidd leaned over to take her  in  his arms. He felt her warm breath against his rough cheek as he   hoisted her over the rail. He stared hard as he released her on deck,   but a thin veil and the gloom of evening baffled his attempt to see   her face. He was conscious that she had been like a feather in his   arms, and that something had thrilled him for a moment as he held her.   He had thought much about Ah Ho. As she slipped away beside the matron   he did not doubt but that she was beautiful, but the Hong-Kong agent   was a half-breed, and spelled beauty in a different language from his.   Anyway, he wanted to see Ah Ho. 
  &quot;Watts, see 'em to the private room,&quot; he said to the mate, who  stood  near. 
  The matron laughed back shrilly from the gathering shadows  amidships.  &quot;He needn't mind,&quot; she called; &quot;I know the way.&quot; 
  The men from the boat had scrambled aboard. One of them introduced   himself as the new Montreal sub-agent, and then presented his   comrades. 
  Captain Kidd pointed to the rifles which they carried. &quot;You may  have  to use them before morning,&quot; he suggested. 
  After a little he instructed Watts as to the course to be pursued  by  the Laura Spreck, and retired to his cabin. The matron had preceded   him and sat at his table coolly sorting a number of papers. As he   entered she looked up and nodded smilingly. Over the captain's   shoulder she caught a glimpse of the sub-agent's boyish face peering   in inquiringly, and called out for him to enter. 
  &quot;I want you to talk with Wilson, Captain,&quot; she begged. &quot;Wilson and  I  are great chums, and I've promised that some day we'd tell him  things  about the lakes. He's almost a Chinaman. He's lived in  Hong-Kong ever  since he was so high.&quot; She measured to her knee. 
  With his big white teeth shining in the glow of the cabin-lamp  Captain  Kidd held out a frank hand. &quot;I'm going there some day, Mr.  Wilson,&quot; he  said. &quot;I've always had a hankering to see both ends of the  workings.&quot; 
  The woman shot the sub-agent a lightning glance from behind the   captain's back. &quot;Captain Kidd knows more about the underground on this   side than any other man,&quot; she said sweetly. &quot;There was McVeigh&#8212;but   he's dead.&quot; Her eyes scintillated at the sub-agent. Suddenly she gave   a hysterical little laugh, and when the captain turned in her   direction her face was buried in her arms. &quot;Ugh-h-h-h! That back there   has shattered my nerves!&quot; she moaned. When she looked up her face was   flushed instead of pale. &quot;We had to kill a man&#8212;perhaps two,&quot; she   said. &quot;You must talk to me, Captain, or I'll go into hysterics. Tell   me something, anything. Wilson wants to hear, too.&quot; 
  &quot;Hear what?&quot; grinned the captain. 
  &quot;About the underground, of course!&quot; blurted the sub-agent. 
  Captain Kidd leaned toward him. The smile left his face. His eyes   shone harshly. &quot;I never talk about that,&quot; he said. There was a warning   in his voice. He would have said more, but his ears caught the cry of   a man outside, a cry which he recognized, and the meaning of which he   read in the sub-agent's flinching eyes and pale cheeks. He wheeled   upon the woman and met her smiling at him over a pistol barrel. 
  &quot;What do you mean&#8212;&quot; he began. 
  &quot;It means,&quot; the woman interrupted him, &quot;&#8212;it means that I've grown   tired of it all, Captain Kidd; that I've turned State's evidence to   save myself; that&#8212;&quot; 
  Captain Kidd turned his head slowly. The sub-agent had him covered   from behind. 
  &quot;It means,&quot; continued the woman, &quot;that the fight on shore was a  ruse;  that the men out there are secret-service agents; that you're  going to  be extradited; and that your crew&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;And Ah Ho?&quot; he interrupted. He faced the woman, gripping the edges  of  the table fiercely. &quot;What about Ah Ho?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, she's all right,&quot; laughed the matron nervously. &quot;She'll make   splendid evidence, Captain. She thinks we're all her friends, poor   thing, and that&#8212;&quot; 
  The woman stopped. Captain Kidd had stretched out his arms to her,  his  face filled with the agony of his helplessness. 
  &quot;Nell!&quot; he cried, his voice pleading. &quot;Nell, I didn't expect it of   you! Oh, God, how I've loved you, Nell, and how I've wanted to tell   you-a dozen times&#8212;a hundred times&#8212;but I've waited&#8212;&quot; In his despair   he seemed to stagger as he approached her. The woman rose. She dropped   her pistol upon the table, and her breath came in hurried gasps.   &quot;Nell! Nell! Don't say you've turned traitor to me!&quot; he pleaded. &quot;Kill   me, Nell, kill me&#8212;kill me&#8212;but don't&#8212;say&#8212;that!&quot; He came nearer,   until his hands touched the woman. Then, in an instant, he was in his   arms. It was as if a vice of steel were rushing the life from her   body. Over her shoulder Captain Kidd's face shone triumphantly at the   secret-service man. The woman was a shield. For a moment he groped   under his coat with one free hand. Then there came a flash of steel, a   sharp report, and the white-faced man in front crumpled up with the   venom of lead in his vitals. 
  &quot;Love you!&quot; hissed the captain in the woman's unhearing ears. &quot;Love   you, you she-fiend! I knew you would do this some day. I guessed it   was coming!&quot; His fingers gripped her throat for a moment; then he   flung her insensible form to the floor, as a heavy knock sounded from   without. Captain Kidd moved like a cat, silently, swiftly. In his day-   dreams he had wondered if something like this would not happen, and   long ago he had prepared for it. Before the knock was repeated he had   snatched up a rug, disclosing a trap-door. In a moment the black exit   lay open before him. He could hear men straining at the door, and   there was an unpleasant smile in his eyes and something dazzlingly   dangerous in the gleam of his strong teeth, as he paused for an   instant, half crouched for the retreat. Unhesitatingly he aimed at the   middle panel of the door and fired twice. After that he slipped   quickly through the hole into the passageway, and locked the trap-door   behind him. 
  &quot;Now, Chinkey,&quot; he spoke softly, &quot;it's for you.&quot; 
  He made his way through the passage, his right shoulder brushing   against the inner timbers of the ship's hull, his left against the   bulkhead. He was now walking with the vessel's deck just above his   head, and by the steps he had taken he knew when he had reached the   secret chamber containing Ah Ho. After a little he found a bolt. This   he drew back noiselessly. Imperceptibly at first he pushed in a door.   A gleam of light caught his eye. There was absolute silence. A   twentieth of an inch, a tenth, a half, then an inch, the aperture   grew. He saw one wall of the room, the door, finally Ah Ho. The girl   was crouching in a listening attitude, her face turned toward the.   hold of the ship. Captain Kidd knew that she had heard the shots.   &quot;Chinkey,&quot; he called in a low voice. &quot;Chinkey!&quot; At the sound of his   voice the girl's white face turned straight toward him. She uttered no   sound, but terror was rooted in her big dark eyes. Those eyes puzzled   Captain Kidd. He could not see her face distinctly, but the eyes   fascinated him. He could not remember having seen a Chinese girl with   eyes like Ah Ho's. 
  &quot;Don't you be afraid, Chinkey,&quot; he said soothingly, thrusting his  head  and shoulders out into the room. &quot;They think they've got us, but  they  ain't!&quot; He pulled himself through, and sprang to the door, As he  shot  the bolt which secured it from the inside he heard a distant  crash.  &quot;That's the cabin-door, Chinkey,&quot; he cried. &quot;We'll fool 'em  yet,  Chinkey, an' th' won't be nobody left to tell how we did it!&quot; 
  As he carried her under the swinging lamp, Ah Ho's veil fell aside,   and Captain Kidd caught a glimpse of her face. &quot;The deuce, Chinkey!   You are pretty, s'elp me; you are!&quot; he exclaimed. He thrust her   through the trap and followed after. &quot;It's darker'n seven devils,   ain't it?&quot; he asked. &quot;Where's your hand, Chinkey?&quot; He squeezed past   her and groped under the cape of the long coat which the agents of the   underground furnished her, until her little trembling fingers lay   gripped in his big palm; then he gently pulled the girl after him. 
  Back of him he heard voices echoing in the passageway. &quot;They've  found  the trap!&quot; he whispered. &quot;God, what a chance to even up!&quot; For a  moment  his blood burned with a desire to turn and, in the narrow  passage,  wreck vengeance upon those who had overcome him by treachery.  He  levelled his revolver over Ah Ho's head, and held it there, with Ah  Ho  trembling close up against him, until he saw a streak of light at  the  other end. 
  &quot;They're coming, Chinkey,&quot; he breathed. &quot;Now we've got to hustle!&quot; 
  He continued down the passage until his outstretched hand touched a   wall. Beyond this he could hear the throbbing of the ship's engines.   For a moment he listened to it, and for the sound of voices behind.   &quot;They think I'm layin' for 'em in the passage,&quot; he whispered joyfully.   &quot;They don't dare follow us, Chinkey!&quot; He dropped Ah Ho's hand, and ran   his fingers over the wall until they found a lock. Slowly he drew the   bolt. Then with a sudden thrust of his shoulder he burst open the   door, and his tense face stared out over his pistol barrel into the   glare of the engine-room. Hopefully his eyes sought for Stetson and   Billy. Both were gone, and in Stetson's place he saw one of the men   who had come with the matron. There was promise of deadly accuracy in   Captain Kidd's aim, and the revenue man threw up his arms without   delay. The smuggler grinned approvingly as he came out, with Ah Ho   close behind. 
  &quot;Guess you'd better git out,&quot; he invited. &quot;That's the best way.&quot; He   nodded toward the passage. There was a dangerous glitter in the eyes   behind the gun, and the officer obeyed. &quot;Tell your friends I'm down   here waitin' for 'em,&quot; said Captain Kidd as he slammed the door. In an   instant he had whirled upon Ah Ho. &quot;Quick&#8212;this way I&quot; he cried. He   caught her almost roughly, and half dragged her to a partly open door   aft of the engines, through which he thrust her ahead of him. The girl   stumbled and fell over a pile, of litter, but her companion seemed not   to have noticed the mishap. Ah Ho could hear him tugging at a heavy   object, and soon she saw him roll something big and round out through   the door. He came back like a shadow, and a second and a third object   were rolled after the first. Then there came the crashing of an axe,   the rattle of shattered glass, and a moment later utter darkness, as   Captain Kidd sprang back and closed the door. 
  &quot;It's done, Chinkey!&quot; he cried, groping for her. 
  Ah Ho stretched up her hands, and Captain Kidd gathered her close  in  his arms. &quot;They've got all that's coming to 'em, now, Chinkey!&quot; he   continued excitedly. &quot;Smell it, girl! D'ye smell it?&quot; He sniffed the   air, already impregnated with a biting, unpleasant odour. &quot;They're   carb'ys of acid, Chinkey! God, I figured this was comin' some day!&quot; He   left her standing, and with the butt of his revolver hammered upon   metal in the side of the hull. Soon had driven back a number of hooks   and now swung open a port as large as one of the traps through which   they had escaped. 
  &quot;See the stars out there, Chinkey?&quot; he whispered, making room for  Ah  Ho at his side. &quot;Well, you'n me'll soon be as free&#8212;&quot; 
  At the head of the engine-room he could hear the excited shouts of   men. But they came no nearer. Even Ah Ho knew why. Through the cracks   of the cubby-room door the acid fumes were pouring stronger each   moment. The girl coughed, and clutched Captain Kidd's arm. The light   from outside shone upon her upturned face, and there the man read   something of what was passing in her soul. He realized for the first   time that this was all a great mystery to her, and that she could only   guess at the significance of the shots ashore, the hurried flight to   the vessel, and his actions now. But she trusted him. He could see   that in her eyes. Her mouth was round and red, like a rose, Captain   Kidd thought, even in that moment, and he saw it tremble as he looked   down into her face. 
  &quot;Chinkey, d'ye know I'm beginning to have a deuced chummy feeling  for  you,&quot; he said. &quot;You're a game little girl, if you are a Chink; and  I  swear I'll feel a bit rummy when I deliver you to that  yellow-skinned  old cuss who's buying you over there!&quot; He stuck his  head out of the  port and looked up. The aft boat was swinging low in  her davits. By  hoisting himself partly through the opening Captain  Kidd reached an  iron ring under the rail of the ship and drew himself  cautiously out  until his free hand gripped the falls. For a few  moments he listened,  almost ceasing to breathe. Amidships he heard the  crash of an axe and  voices that came to him indistinctly. But the  stern of the smuggler  seemed deserted. Unlooping the falls, he held  the ropes taut while he  retreated through the port. Then, with arms  and shoulders out, he  lowered the boat until it swung within a foot of  the water. 
  &quot;Chinkey!&quot; he whispered. 
  He slipped the ropes under the swing of the port-door, and lifted  Ah  Ho through. As her feet touched the boat he released his hold and   climbed out himself. He half hung in the porthole, listening for the   explosion which he knew would come soon, until the fumes of the acid   drove him down. Crouching beside Ah Ho, he loosed the falls, and the   small boat plunged into the tumultuous trail of the ship, which   dragged out behind like a molten river tossing in the face of the   moon. A shout of triumph half rose in the throat of Captain Kidd, but   when his lips parted it came only in a throttled, inarticulate cry. He   leaned out until the crests of the waves swept their spray into his   eyes. His lean, white face was alight with a passion as hard as the   glint of the pistol barrel which reached out toward the Laura Spreck.   The ship was dissolving into a shadow, and before it disappeared   Captain Kidd longed to let those upon it know that he had beaten them.   He thought of the woman who had betrayed him, and the desire became   overwhelming. For a moment he hesitated, and in that moment he fancied   he heard a rumbling from here the lights were slipping away into the   gloom of the night. When he was sure of it, he sprang up tall and   gaunt between Ah Ho and the moon, and tossed his long arms over his   head with a far-reaching cry of joy. Then he sat down, and Ah Ho crept   to him and remained unnoticed for a time in a trembling heap. When the   man turned from his lost ship she was staring straight up at him. 
  &quot;Didn't you hear it, Chinkey?&quot; he asked. He leaned over and tilted  the  girl's face up by placing his forefinger under her chin, much as  if  she had been a child. &quot;Didn't you hear it, Chinkey? That was the  acid  getting next to the boiler fires! You'll soon see it. Look!&quot; He   stretched out an arm, and Ah Ho drew herself up beside his knee to get   the direction. &quot;Mebby you've never seen anything like what's going to   happen,&quot; he spoke reassuringly, &quot;but don't get scared. They'll get off   all right, because there's two rafts and another boat on board.&quot; An   understanding came to her that something was going to happen somewhere   out in the gloom and shut out the vastness of the lake, and she   watched for it with the tragic eagerness of the man. 
  &quot;It's coming&#8212;soon!&quot; whispered the man. His words were tremulous  with  excitement. &quot;It's coming, Chinkey.&quot; 
  A mile away a tiny red streak seemed to split the blackness. Ah Ho   felt him twitch as though he had been stung. She turned her face to   him instinctively, and when she looked back the red streak had grown   into a lurid glare with twisting flashes of flame shooting skyward.   And as those flames grew higher and higher and the glare spread until   half the lake seemed lit up by it, she snuggled close to Captain Kidd   in her wonderment and terror, and the captain, opening both arms, held   her so close that when all was over and only a dull glow lasted in the   distance Ah Ho was almost breathless from the embrace. 
  &quot;She's gone, Chinkey,&quot; he said. For many minutes he remained  silent,  until even the glow was out of the sky; then he set Ah Ho down  in the  bottom of the boat and leaned over until his face was very near  to her  own. &quot;I'm going, too, Chinkey,&quot; he continued. &quot;I've got to.   Everybody'll know who Captain Kidd is now, 'n' there's fifty years o'   bars waiting for me if I go back there I&quot; He swept an arm toward the   American shore. &quot;I'll miss the old ship like the devil, but I don't   know but I'll miss you more, Chinkey.&quot; 
  Suddenly he reached out and took Ah Ho's face in both of his hands.   &quot;Listen, Chinkey!&quot; he cried. &quot;In the sand over there on the point I've   buried all I ever made&#8212;and it's a plenty. The sand was safer'n banks,   mind you, seeing as I was Cap'n Kidd, and I'm going for it-now I And   when I get it I'm going to take you to a place away off there&#8212;so far   up that it's cold most all the year round, and then-and then,  Chinkey&#8212;&quot; 
  He drew the girl's face so close to his own that his lips touched  it,  &quot;And then I'm going to teach you American, 'n' you're going to  teach  me Chink, and between us I'm going to find out darned soon how  bad you  hate that yellow-hided cuss who bought you. An' I reckon,  Chinkey,  that I've got enough to pay your family's debt.&quot; 
  With a cheery heigh-ho Captain Kidd unlocked the boat's oars,  turned  his broad back upon Ah Ho, and struck out for the sand-dunes of  Point  Pelee.
