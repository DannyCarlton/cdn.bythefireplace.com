In the dusk of the evening the whole force came to the crest of a hill  from which through a cleft they caught a glimpse of the shimmering  waters of the lake, called by the Iroquois Andiatarocte, by the French,  St. Sacrement, and by the English, George. It was not Robert's first  view of it, but he always thrilled at the prospect.    
"Both Andiatarocte and Oneadatote must be ours," he said to Tayoga.  "They're too fine and beautiful to pass into possession of the French."    
"What about the Hodenosaunee? Do you too forget, Dagaeoga?"    
"I don't forget, Tayoga. When I said 'ours' I meant American,  Hodenosaunee and English combined. You've good eyes, and so tell me if  I'm not right when I say I see a moving black dot on the lake."    
"You do see it, my friend, and also a second and a third. The segment of  the lake that we can see from here is very narrow. At this distance it  does not appear to be more than a few inches across, but I know as  surely as Tododaho sits on his star watching over us, that those are  canoes, or perhaps long boats, and that they belong to our enemies."    
"A force on the water cooeperating with that on land?"    
"It seems so, Dagaeoga."    
"And they mean to become the rulers of the lakes! With their army  powerfully established at Crown Point, and their boats on both  Andiatarocte and Oneadatote, it looks as if they were getting a great  start in that direction."    
"Aye, Dagaeoga. The French move faster than we. They seize what we both  wish, and then it will be for us to put them out, they being in  possession and intrenched. Look, Black Rifle comes out of the forest!  And Haace is with him! They have something to tell!"    
It was the honor and pleasure of young Lennox and the Onondaga to be  present at the councils, and though they said nothing to their elders  unless asked for an opinion, they always listened with eagerness to  everything. Now Willet, Rogers and Daganoweda drew together, and Black  Rifle and Haace, their dark eyes gleaming, made report to them.    
"A strong force, at least one hundred and fifty men, lies about five  miles to the north, on the shore of the lake," said Black Rifle. "About  twenty Frenchmen are with it, and it is commanded by St. Luc. I saw him  from the bushes. He has with him the Canadian, Dubois. De Courcelles and  Jumonville are there also. At least a hundred warriors and Frenchmen are  on the lake, in canoes and long boats. I saw Tandakora too."    
"A formidable force," said Willet. "Do you wish to turn back,  Daganoweda?"    
The eyes of the Mohawk chieftain glittered and he seemed to swell both  in size and stature.    
"We are a hundred," he replied proudly. "What does it matter how many  they are? I am astonished that the Great Bear should ask me such a  question."    
Willet laughed softly.    
"I asked it," he said, "because I knew what the answer would be. None  other could come from a Mohawk chieftain."    
Again the eyes of Daganoweda glittered, but this time with pride.    
"Shall we advance and attack St. Luc's force tonight?" said Willet,  turning to Rogers.    
"I think it would be best," replied the Mountain Wolf. "A surprise is  possible tonight only. Tomorrow his scouts are sure to find that we are  near. What say you, Daganoweda?"    
"Tonight," replied the Mohawk chief, sententiously.    
There was no further discussion, and the whole force, throwing out  skirmishers, moved cautiously northward through the great, green  wilderness. It was a fair night for a march, not enough moonlight to  disclose them at a distance, and yet enough to show the way. Robert kept  close to Tayoga, who was just behind Willet, and they bore in toward the  lake, until they were continually catching glimpses of its waters  through the vast curtain of the forest.    
Robert's brain once more formed pictures, swift, succeeding one another  like changes of light, but in high colors. The great lake set in the  mountains and glimmering under the moon had a wonderful effect upon his  imagination. It became for the time the core of all the mighty struggle  that was destined to rage so long in North America. The belief became a  conviction that whoever possessed Andiatarocte and Oneadatote was  destined to possess the continent.    
The woods themselves, like the lake, were mystic and brooding. Their  heavy foliage was ruffled by no wind, and no birds sang. The wild  animals, knowing that man, fiercer than they, would soon join in mortal  combat, had all fled away. Robert heard only the faint crush of  moccasins as the hundred, white and red, sped onward.    
An hour, and a dim light showed on a slope gentler than the rest,  leading down to the lake. It was a spark so faint and vague that it  might have passed to the ordinary eye as a firefly, but rangers and  Mohawks knew well that it came from some portion of St. Luc's camp and  that the enemy was close at hand. Then the band stopped and the three  leaders talked together again for a few moments.    
"I think," said Willet, "that the force on land is in touch with the one  in the boats, though a close union has not been effected. In my opinion  we must rush St. Luc."    
"There is no other way," said Rogers.    
"It is what I like best," said Daganoweda.    
They promptly spread out, the entire hundred in a half circle, covering  a length of several hundred yards, and the whole force advanced swiftly.  Robert and Tayoga were in the center, and as they rushed forward with  the others, their moccasined feet making scarcely any sound, Robert saw  the fireflies in the forest increase, multiply and become fixed. If he  had felt any doubt that the camp of St. Luc was just ahead it  disappeared now. The brilliant French leader too, despite all his craft,  and lore of the forest, was about to be surprised.    
Then he heard the sharp reports of rifles both to right and left. The  horns of the advancing crescent were coming into contact with St. Luc's  sentinels. Then Daganoweda, knowing that the full alarm had been given,  uttered a fierce and thrilling cry and all the Mohawks took it up. It  was a tremendous shout, making the blood leap and inciting to battle.    
Robert, by nature kindly and merciful, felt the love of combat rising in  him, and when a bullet whistled past his ear a fury against the enemy  began to burn in his veins. More bullets came pattering upon the leaves,  and one found its target in a ranger who was struck through the heart.  Other rangers and Mohawks received wounds, but under the compelling  orders of their leaders they held their fire until they were near the  camp, when nearly a hundred rifles spoke together in one fierce and  tremendous report.    
St. Luc's sentinels and skirmishers were driven back in a minute or two,  many of them falling, but his main force lay along a low ridge, timbered  well, and from its shelter his men, French and Indians, sent in a rapid  fire. Although taken by surprise and suffering severely in the first  rush, they were able to stem the onset of the rangers and Mohawks, and  soon they were uttering fierce and defiant cries, while their bullets  came in showers. The rangers and Mohawks also took to cover, and the  battle of the night and the wilderness was on.    
Robert pulled Tayoga down, and the two lay behind a fallen log, where  they listened to the whining of an occasional bullet over their heads.    
"We may win," said the Onondaga gravely, "but we will not win so easily.  One cannot surprise Sharp Sword (St. Luc) wholly. You may attack when he  is not expecting it, but even then he will make ready for you."    
"That's true," said Robert, and he felt a curious and contradictory  thrill of pleasure as he listened to Tayoga. "It's not possible to take  the Chevalier in a trap."    
"No, Dagaeoga, it is not. I wish, for the sake of our success, that some  other than he was the leader of the enemy, but Manitou has willed that  my wish should not come true. Do you not think the dark shadow passing  just then on the ridge was Tandakora?"    
"The size indicated to me the Ojibway, and I was about to seize my rifle  and fire, but it's too far for a shot with any certainty. I think our  men on the horns of the crescent are driving them in somewhat."    
"The shifting of the firing would prove that it is so, Dagaeoga. Our  sharpshooting is much better than theirs, and in time we will push them  down to the lake. But look at Black Rifle! See how he craves the  battle!"    
The swart ranger, lying almost flat on the ground, was creeping forward,  inch by inch, and as Robert glanced at him he fired, a savage in the  opposing force uttering his death yell. The ranger uttered a shout of  triumph, and, shifting his position, sought another shot, his dark body  drawn among the leaves and grass like that of some fierce wild animal.  He fired a second time, repeated his triumphant shout and then his  sliding body passed out of sight among the bushes.    
Both Rogers and Willet soon joined Robert and Tayoga behind the logs  where they had a good position from which to direct the battle, but  Daganoweda on the right, with all of his Mohawks, was pushing forward  steadily and would soon be able to pour a flanking fire into St. Luc's  little army. The forest resounded now with the sharp reports of the  rifles and the shouts and yells of the combatants. Bullets cut leaves  and twigs, but the rangers and the Mohawks were advancing.    
"Do you know how many men we have lost, Rogers?" asked Willet.    
"Three of the white men and four of the Mohawks have been slain, Dave,  but we're winning a success, and it's not too high a price to pay in  war. If Daganoweda can get far enough around on their left flank we'll  drive 'em into the lake, sure. Ah, there go the rifles of the Mohawks  and they're farther forward than ever. That Mohawk chief is a bold  fighter, crafty and full of fire."    
"None better than he. I think they're well around the flank, Rogers.  Listen to their shouts. Now, we'll make a fresh rush of our own."    
They sprang from the shelter of the log, and, leading their men, rushed  in a hundred yards until they dropped down behind another one. Robert  and Tayoga went with them, firing as they ran, borne on by the thrill of  combat, but Robert felt relief nevertheless when he settled again in the  shelter of the second log and for the time being was secure from  bullets.    
"I think," said Willet to Rogers, "that I'll go around toward the left,  where the flanking force is composed mostly of rangers, and press in  there with all our might. If the two horns of the crescent are able to  enclose St. Luc, and you charge at the center, we should win the victory  soon."    
"It's the right idea, Dave," said Rogers. "When we hear your shots and a  shout or two we'll drive our hardest."    
"I'd like to take Tayoga and Robert with me."    
"They're yours. They're good and brave lads, and I'll need 'em, but  you'll need 'em too. How many more of the men here will you want?"    
"About ten."    
"Then take them too."    
Willet, with Robert, Tayoga and the ten, began a cautious circuit in the  darkness toward the western horn of the crescent, and for a few minutes  left the battle in the distance. As they crept through the bushes,  Robert heard the shouts and shots of both sides and saw the pink flashes  of flame as the rifles were fired. In the darkness it seemed confused  and vague, but he knew that it was guided by order and precision. Now  and then a spent bullet pattered upon the leaves, and one touched him  upon the wrist, stinging for a moment or two, but doing no harm.    
But as they passed farther and farther to the west the noise of the  battle behind them gradually sank, while that on the left horn of the  crescent grew.    
In a few more minutes they would be with the rangers who were pressing  forward so strenuously at that point, and as Robert saw dusky figures  rise from the bushes in front of them he believed they were already in  touch. Instead a dozen rifles flashed in their faces. One of the rangers  went down, shot through the head, dead before he touched the ground,  three more sustained slight wounds, including Robert who was grazed on  the shoulder, and all of them gave back in surprise and consternation.  But Willet, shrewd veteran of the forest, recovered himself quickly.    
"Down, men! Down and give it back to 'em!" he cried. "They've sent out a  flanking force of their own! It was clever of St. Luc!"    
All the rangers dropped on their faces instantly, but as they went down  they gave back the fire of the flanking party. Robert caught a glimpse  of De Courcelles, who evidently was leading it, and pulled trigger on  him, but the Frenchman turned aside at that instant, and his bullet  struck a St. Regis Indian who was just behind him. Now the return volley  of the rangers was very deadly. Two Frenchmen were slain here and four  warriors, and De Courcelles, who had not expected on his circling  movement to meet with a new force, was compelled to give back. He and  his warriors quickly disappeared in the forest, leaving their dead  behind them, and Willet with his own little force moved on triumphantly,  soon joining his strength to that of the rangers on the left.    
The combined force hurled itself upon St. Luc's flank and crumpled it  up, at the same time uttering triumphant shouts which were answered from  the right and center, rangers and Mohawks on all fronts now pressing  forward, and sending in their bullets from every covert. So fierce was  their attack that they created the effect of double or triple their  numbers, and St. Luc's French and Indians were driven down the slope to  the edge of the lake, where the survivors were saved by the second band  in the canoes and great boats.    
The defeated men embarked quickly, but not so quickly that several more  did not fall in the water. At this moment Robert saw St. Luc, and he  never admired him more. He, too, was in forest green, but it was of the  finest cloth, trimmed with green yet darker. A cap of silky fur was on  his head, and his hair was clubbed in a queue behind. March and forest  battle had not dimmed the cleanliness and neatness of his attire, and,  even in defeat, he looked the gallant chevalier, without fear and  without reproach.    
St. Luc was in the act of stepping into one of the long boats when a  ranger beside Robert raised his rifle and took aim squarely at the  Frenchman's heart. It was not a long shot and the ranger would not have  missed, but young Lennox at that moment stumbled and fell against him,  causing the muzzle of his weapon to be deflected so much that his bullet  struck the uncomplaining water. Robert's heart leaped up as he saw the  chevalier spring into the boat, which the stalwart Indians paddled  swiftly away.    
The entire Indian fleet now drew together, and it was obviously making  for one of the little islands, so numerous in Andiatarocte, where it  would be safe until the English and Americans built or brought boats of  their own and disputed the rulership of the lake. But the rangers and  the Mohawks, eager to push the victory, rushed down to the water's edge  and sent after the flying fleet bullets which merely dropped vainly in  the water. Then they ceased, and, standing there, uttered long thrilling  shouts of triumph.    
Robert had never beheld a more ferocious scene but he felt in it, too, a  sort of fierce and shuddering attraction. His veins were still warm with  the fire of battle, and his head throbbed wildly. Everything took on  strange and fantastic shapes, and colors became glaring and violent. The  moonlight, pouring down on the lake, made it a vast sea of crumbling  silver, the mountains on the farther shores rose to twice or thrice  their height, and the forests on the slopes and crests were an immense  and unbroken curtain, black against the sky.    
Five or six hundred yards away hovered the Indian fleet, the canoes and  boats dark splotches upon the silver surface of the water. The island  upon which they intended to land was just beyond them, but knowing that  they were out of rifle range they had paused to look at the victorious  force, or as much of it as showed itself, and to send back the defiant  yells of a defeated, but undaunted band.    
Robert clearly saw St. Luc again, standing up in his boat, and  apparently giving orders to the fleet, using his small sword, as a  conductor wields a baton, though the moonlight seemed to flash in fire  along the blade as he pointed it here and there. He beheld something  fierce and unconquerable in the man's attitude and manner. He even  imagined that he could see his face, and he knew that the eye was calm,  despite defeat and loss. St Luc, driven from the field, would be none  the less dangerous than if he had been victor upon it.    
The whole Indian fleet formed in a half circle and the Chevalier ceased  to wave orders with his sword. Then he drew himself up, stood rigidly  erect, despite his unstable footing, faced the land, and, using the  sword once more, gave a soldier's salute to the foe. The act was so  gallant, so redolent of knightly romance that despite themselves the  rangers burst into a mighty cheer, and the Mohawks, having the Indian  heart that always honored a brave foe, uttered a long and thrilling  whoop of approval.    
Robert, carried away by an impulse, sprang upon a rock and whirled his  rifle around his head in an answering salute. St. Luc evidently saw, and  evidently, too, he recognized Robert, as he lifted his sword in  rejoinder. Then the Indians, bent to their paddles, and the fleet,  hanging together, swept around the island and out of sight. But they  knew that the French and Indian force landed there, as fires soon blazed  upon its heavily-wooded crest, and they saw dusky figures passing and  repassing before the flames.    
"The victory has been given to us tonight," said Tayoga gravely to  Robert, "but Manitou has not allowed us to complete it. Few triumph over  St. Luc, and, though his manner may have been gay and careless, his  heart burns to win back what he has lost."    
"I take it you're right, Tayoga," said Robert. "His is a soul that will  not rest under defeat, and I fancy St. Luc on the island is a great  danger. He can get at us and we can't get at him."    
"It is true, Dagaeoga. If we strike we must strike quickly and then be  off. This, for the time being, is the enemy's country, yet I think our  leaders will not be willing to withdraw. Daganoweda, I know, will want  to push the battle and to attack on the island."    
The Onondaga's surmise was correct. The triumph of the rangers and the  Mohawks, although not complete, was large, as at least one-third of St.  Luc's force was slain, and the three leaders alike were eager to make it  yet larger, having in mind that in some way they could yet reach the  French and Indian force on the island. So they built their own fires on  the slope and the Mohawks began to sing songs of triumph, knowing that  they would infuriate the foe, and perhaps tempt him to some deed of  rashness.    
"Did you see anything of Tandakora?" asked Robert of Tayoga. "I know  it's no crime to wish that he fell."    
"No, it's no crime, Dagaeoga," replied the Onondaga soberly, "and my  wish is the same as yours, but this time we cannot have it. I saw him in  one of the boats as they passed around the island."    
The two then sat by one of the fires and ate venison, thankful that they  had escaped with only slight wounds, and as there was no immediate call  for their services they wrapped themselves in their blankets, by and by,  and went to sleep. When Robert awoke, the morning was about half gone  and the day was bright and beautiful beyond compare.    
Although the hostile forces still confronted each other there was no  other evidence of war, and Robert's first feelings were less for man and  more for the magnificence of nature. He had never seen Andiatarocte,  the matchless gem of the mountains, more imposing and beautiful. Its  waters, rippling gently under the wind, stretched far away, silver or  gold, as the sunlight fell. The trees and undergrowth on the islands  showed deepest green, and the waving leaves shifted and changed in color  with the changing sky. Far over all was a deep velvet blue arch, tinged  along the edges with red or gold.    
Keenly sensitive to nature, it was a full minute before young Lennox  came back to earth, and the struggles of men. Then he found Tayoga  looking at him curiously.    
"It is good!" said the Onondaga, flinging out his hand. "In the white  man's Bible it is said that Manitou created the world in six days and  rested on the seventh, but in the unwritten book of the Hodenosaunee it  is said that he created Andiatarocte and Oneadatote, and then reposed a  bit, and enjoyed his work before he went on with his task."    
"I can well believe you, Tayoga. If I had created a lake like George and  another like Champlain I should have stopped work, and gloried quite a  while over my achievement. Has the enemy made any movement while we  slept?"    
"None, so far as our people can tell. They have brought part of their  fleet around to the side of the island facing us. I count six large  boats and twenty canoes there. I also see five fires, and I have no  doubt that many of the warriors are sleeping before them. Despite  losses, his force is still larger than ours, but I do not think St. Luc,  brave as he is, would come back to the mainland and risk a battle with  us."    
"Then we must get at him somehow, Tayoga. We must make our blow so  heavy that it will check Dieskau for a while and give Colonel Johnson's  army time to march."    
"Even so, Dagaeoga. Look at the Mountain Wolf. He has a pair of field  glasses and he is studying the island."    
Rogers stood on a knoll, and he was making diligent use of his glasses,  excellent for the time. He took them from his eyes presently, and walked  down to Robert and Tayoga.    
"Would you care to have a look?" he said to Robert.    
"Thank you, I'd like it very much," replied young Lennox eagerly.    
The powerful lenses at once brought the island very near, and trees and  bushes became detached from the general mass, until he saw between them  the French and Indian camp. As Tayoga had asserted, many of the warriors  were asleep on the grass. When nothing was to be done, the Indian could  do it with a perfection seldom attained by anybody else. Tandakora was  sitting on a fallen log, looking at the mainland. As usual, he was bare  to the waist, and painted frightfully. Not far away a Frenchman was  sleeping on a cloak, and Robert was quite sure that it was De  Courcelles. St. Luc himself was visible toward the center of the island.  He, too, stood upon a knoll, and he, too, had glasses with which he was  studying his foe.    
"The command of the water," said Rogers, "is heavily against us. If we  had only been quick enough to build big boats of our own, the tale to  be told would have been very different."    
"And if by any means," said Willet, "we contrive to drive them from the  island, they can easily retreat in their fleet to another, and they  could repeat the process indefinitely. George has many islands."    
"Then why not capture their fleet?" said Robert in a moment of  inspiration.    
Rogers and Willet looked at each other.    
"It's queer we didn't think of that before," said the hunter.    
"'Twill be an attempt heavy with danger," said Rogers.    
"So it will, my friend, but have we shirked dangers? Don't we live and  sleep with danger?"    
"I was merely stating the price, Dave. I was making no excuse for  shirking."    
"I know it, old friend. Whoever heard of Robert Rogers shunning danger?  We'll have a talk with Daganoweda, and you, Robert, since you suggested  the plan, and you, Tayoga, since you've a head full of wisdom, shall be  present at the conference."    
The Mohawk chieftain came, and, when the scheme was laid before him, he  was full of eagerness for it.    
"Every one of my warriors will be glad to go," he said, "and I, as  becomes my place, will lead them. It will be a rare deed, and the news  of it will be heard with wonder and admiration in all our castles."    
He spoke in the language of the Ganeagaono, which all the others  understood perfectly, and the two white leaders knew they could rely  upon the courage and enthusiasm of the Mohawks.    
"It depends upon the sun whether we shall succeed tonight or not," said  Tayoga, glancing up at the heavens, "and at present he gives no promise  of favoring us. The sun, as you know, Dagaeoga, is with us the Sun God,  also, whom we call Areskoui, or now and then Aieroski, and who is  sometimes almost the same as Manitou."    
"I know," said Robert, who had an intimate acquaintance with the complex  Pantheon of the Hodenosaunee, which was yet not so complex after all,  and which also had in its way the elements of the Christian religion in  all their beauty and majesty.    
Tayoga gazed out upon Andiatarocte.    
Robert's eyes followed the Onondaga's.    
"It's true," he said, "that the Sun God, your Areskoui, and mine, too,  for that matter, makes no promise to us. The warriors of the  Hodenosaunee have looked upon Andiatarocte for many centuries, but  doubtless there has never been a day before when any one of them saw it  more beautiful and more gleaming than it is now."    
"Yes, Dagaeoga, the waters slide and ripple before the wind, and they  are blue and green, and silver and gold, and all the shades between, as  the sunlight shifts and falls, but it is many hours until night and  Areskoui may be of another mind by then."    
"I know it, Tayoga. I remember the two storms on Champlain, and I don't  forget how quickly they can come on either lake. I'm not praying for any  storm, but I do want a dark and cloudy night."    
"Dagaeoga should not be too particular," said Tayoga, his eyes  twinkling. "He has told Areskoui exactly what kind of a night he  wishes, but I think he will have to take just the kind of a night that  Areskoui may send."    
"I don't dispute it, Tayoga, but when you're praying to the Sun God it's  as well to pray for everything you want."    
"We'll watch Areskoui with more than common interest today, you and I,  Dagaeoga, but the warriors of the Ganeagaono, even as the Hurons, the  Abenakis and the Ojibways, will go to sleep. Behold, Daganoweda even now  lies down upon his blanket!"    
The Mohawk chief, as if sure that nothing more of importance was going  to happen that day, spread his fine green blanket upon some leaves, and  then settling himself in an easy posture upon it, fell asleep, while  many of his warriors, and some of the rangers too, imitated his example.  But Robert and Tayoga had slept enough, and, though they moved about but  little, they were all eyes and ears.    
Scouts had been sent far up and down the shores of the lake, and they  reported that no other band was near, chance leaving the issue wholly to  the two forces that now faced each other. Yet the morning, while  remaining of undimmed beauty, had all the appearance of ease, even of  laziness. Several of the rangers went down to the edge of the lake, and,  removing their clothing, bathed in the cool waters. Then they lay on the  slope until their bodies dried, dressed themselves, and waited patiently  for the night.    
The French and Indians, seeing them engaged in a pleasant task, found it  well to do likewise. The waters close to the island were filled with  Frenchmen, Canadians and Indians, wading, swimming and splashing water,  the effect in the distance being that of boys on a picnic and enjoying  it to the utmost.    
Robert took a little swim himself, though he kept close to the shore,  and felt much refreshed by it. When he had been dried by the sun and was  bade in his clothes, he stretched himself luxuriously near the rangers  on the slope, taking an occasional glance at the sun from under his  sheltering hand.    
"There is a little mist in the southwest," he said, after a long time,  to Tayoga. "Do you think it possible that Areskoui will change his mind  and cease to flood the world with beams?"    
"I see the vapor," replied Tayoga, looking keenly. "It is just a wisp,  no larger than a feather from the wing of an eagle, but it seems to  grow. Areskoui changes his mind as he pleases. Who are we to question  the purposes of the Sun God? Yet I take it, Dagaeoga, that the chance of  a night favorable to our purpose has increased."    
"I begin to think, Tayoga, that Areskoui does, in truth, favor us,  through no merit of ours, but perhaps because of a lack of merit in  Tandakora and De Courcelles. Yet, as I live, you're right when you say  the cloud of mist or vapor is growing. Far in the southwest, so it seems  to me, the air becomes dim. I know it, because I can't see the forests  there as distinctly as I did a half hour ago, and I hold that the change  in Areskoui's heart is propitious to our plan."    
"A long speech, but your tongue always moves easily, Dagaeoga, and what  you say is true. The mist increases fast, and before he goes down on the  other side of the world the Sun God will be veiled in it. Then the  night will come full of clouds, and dark. Look at Andiatarocte, and you  will see that it is so."    
The far shores of the lake were almost lost in the vapors, only spots of  forest green appearing now and then, a veil of silver being over the  eastern waters. The island on which St. Luc lay encamped was growing  indistinct, and the fires there shone through a white mist.    
Tayoga stood up and gazed intently at the sun, before which a veil had  been drawn, permitting his eyes to dwell on its splendors, now coming in  a softened and subdued light.    
"All the omens are favorable," he said. "The heart of Areskoui has  softened toward us, knowing that we are about to go on a great and  perilous venture. Tonight Tododaho on his star will also look down  kindly on us. He will be beyond the curtain of the clouds, and we will  not see him, but I know that it will be so, because I feel in my heart  that it must be so. You and I, Dagaeoga, are only two, and among the  many on this earth two can count for little, but the air is full of  spirits, and it may be that they have heard our prayers. With the unseen  powers the prayers of the humble and the lowly avail as much as those of  the great and mighty."    
His eyes bore the rapt and distant expression of the seer, as he  continued to gaze steadily at the great silver robe that hung before the  face of Areskoui's golden home. Splendid young warrior that he was,  always valiant and skillful in battle, there was a spiritual quality in  Tayoga that often showed. The Onondagas were the priestly nation of the  Hodenosaunee and upon him had descended a mantle that was, in a way, the  mantle of a prophet. Robert, so strongly permeated by Indian lore and  faith, really believed, for a moment, that his comrade saw into the  future.    
But not the white youth and the red youth alone bore witness to the  great change, the phenomenon even, that Areskoui was creating. Both  Rogers and Willet had looked curiously at the sun, and then had looked  again. Daganoweda, awaking, stood up and gazed in the intent and  reverential manner that Tayoga had shown. The soul of the Mohawk  chieftain was fierce. He existed for the chase and war, and had no love  beyond them. There was nothing spiritual in his nature, but none the  less he was imbued with the religion of his race, and believed that the  whole world, the air, the forests, the mountains, and the lakes were  peopled with spirits, good or bad. Now he saw one of the greatest of  them all, Areskoui, the Sun God himself, in action and working a  miracle.    
The untamable soul of Daganoweda was filled with wonder and admiration.  Not spiritual, he was nevertheless imaginative to a high degree. Through  the silver veil which softened the light of the sun more and more,  permitting his eyes to remain fixed upon it, he saw a mighty figure in  the very center of that vast globe of light, a figure that grew and grew  until he knew it was Areskoui, the Sun God himself.    
A shiver swept over the powerful frame of Daganoweda. The Mohawk  chieftain, whose nerves never quivered before the enemy, felt as a  little child in the presence of the mighty Sun God. But his confidence  returned. Although the figure of Areskoui continued to grow, his face  became benevolent. He looked down from his hundred million miles in the  void, beheld the tiny figure of Daganoweda standing upon the earth, and  smiled. Daganoweda knew that it was so, because he saw the smile with  his own eyes, and, however perilous the venture might be, he knew then  it could not fail, because Areskoui himself had smiled upon it.    
The great veil of mist deepened and thickened and was drawn slowly  across all the heavens. Robert felt a strange thrill of awe. It was, in  very truth, to him a phenomenon, more than an eclipse, not a mere  passage of the moon before the sun for which science gave a natural  account, but a sudden combination of light and air that had in it a  tinge of the supernatural.    
All the Mohawks were awake now, everybody was awake and everybody  watched the sun, but perhaps it was Daganoweda who saw most. No tincture  of the white man's religion had ever entered his mind to question any of  his Iroquois beliefs. There was Areskoui, in the very center of the sun,  mighty and shining beyond belief, and still smiling across his hundred  million miles at the earth upon which Daganoweda stood. But, all the  while he was drawing his silver robe, fold on fold, thicker and tighter  about himself, and his figure grew dim.    
One after another the distant islands in the lake sank out of sight, and  the fires were merely a faint red glow on the one occupied by St. Luc.  Over the waters the vapors swept in great billows and columns.  Daganoweda drew a great breath. The sun itself was fading. Areskoui had  shown his face long enough and now he meant to make the veil between  himself and man impenetrable. He became a mere shadow, the mists and  vapors rolled up wave on wave, and he was gone entirely. Then night came  down over mountains, forest and Andiatarocte. The last fire on St Luc's  island had been permitted to die out, and it, too, sank into the mists  and vapors with the others, and was invisible to the watchers on the  mainland slope.    
But little could be seen of Andiatarocte itself, save occasional  glimmers of silver under the floating clouds. Not a star was able to  come out, and all the lake and country about it were wrapped in a heavy  grayish mist which seemed to Robert to be surcharged with some kind of  exciting solution. But the three leaders, Rogers, Willet and Daganoweda,  gathered in a close council, did not yet give any order save that plenty  of food be served to rangers and Mohawks alike.    
Thus a long time was permitted to pass and the mists and vapors over  Andiatarocte deepened steadily. No sound came from St. Luc's island, nor  was any fire lighted there. For all the darkness showed, it had sunk  from sight forever. It was an hour till midnight when the three leaders  gave their orders and the chosen band began to prepare. Robert had  begged to be of the perilous number. He could never endure it if Tayoga  went and not he, and Willet, though reluctant, was compelled to consent.  Willet himself was going also, and so was Daganoweda, of course, and  Black Rifle, but Rogers was to remain behind, in command of the force on  the slope.    
Thirty rangers and thirty Mohawks, all powerful swimmers, were chosen,  and every man stripped to the skin. Firearms, of necessity, were left  behind with the clothes, but everyone buckled a belt around his bare  body, and put in it his hatchet and hunting knife. The plan was to swim  silently for the island and then trust to courage, skill and fortune.  Buoyed up by the favor of Areskoui, who had worked a miracle for them,  the sixty dropped into the water, and began their night of extreme  hazard.
