On the following evening she went with the Montgomerys to the Army and  Navy reception at the White House. Lady Mary had but to express a wish  for a card to any function in Washington; and her popularity had much  to do with her love for her adopted country.    
It was the first time Betty ever had entered the historic mansion, and  as she waited for twenty minutes in the crush of people on the front  porch, she reflected that probably it was the last.    
But when she was in the great East Room, which was hung with flags and  glittered with uniforms, and was filled with the strains of martial  music, she thrilled again with the historical sense, and almost wished  there was a prospect of a war which would compel her to patriotic  excitement.    
They remained in the East Room for some time before going to shake  hands with the President, that the long queue of people patiently  crawling to the Blue Room might have time to wear itself down to a  point. As Betty stood there eagerly watching the scene, and talking to  first one and then another of the Army men who came up to speak to  her, she became deeply impressed with the fact that this was the  calmest function she had attended in Washington during the winter.  There was no excitement on the faces of these men in uniform, and they  said little and hardly mentioned the subject of war. They looked stern  and thoughtful; and Betty felt proud of them, and wished they were  doing themselves honour in a better cause.    
She went down the long central corridor after a time, past the crowd  wedged before the central door, gaping at the receiving party, to a  room where she and the Montgomerys joined the diminished queue  extending from a side entrance to the Blue Room. She was not surprised  to see Mrs. Mudd in front of her, for although the Representative's  wife should have received a card for another evening, she was quite  capable of forcing her way in without one; as doubtless a good many  others had done to-night. She wore her black silk gown and her bonnet,  and although most of the women present were in brilliant evening  dress, Mrs. Mudd had several to keep her in countenance. She glanced  wearily over her shoulder during the slow progress of the queue, and  caught sight of Betty. Her place was precious, but she left it at once  and came down the line.    
"I'll go in along with you," she said. "George couldn't come and I've  felt kinder lonesome ever sense I got here. And we've been three  quarters of an hour getting this far. It's terrible tiresome, but as  I've found you I guess I can stand the rest of it."    
Betty detected the flicker of malice in her former housekeeper's  voice. They were on equal ground for once, and Miss Madison and Mrs.  Mudd would shake hands with their President within consecutive  moments. She smiled with some cynicism, but was too good-natured to  snub the native ambition where it could do no harm.    
"I saw Senator North to-day," observed Mrs. Mudd, "and he looked  crosser 'n two sticks. He's mad because they'll have war in spite of  him. I call him right down unpatriotic, and so do lots of others."    
"That disturbs him a great deal. He is much more concerned about the  country making a fool of itself."    
"This country's all right, and we couldn't go wrong if we tried. Them  that sets themselves up to be so terrible superior are just bad  Americans, that's the long and the short of it, and they'll find it  out at the next elections. If Senator North should take a trip out  West just now, they'd tar and feather him, and I'd like to be there to  see it done. They can't say what they think of his setting on  patriotic Senators loud enough. And as for the President--"    
"Well, don't criticise the President while you are under his roof. It  is bad manners. Here we are. Will you go in first?"    
"Well, I don't see why I shouldn't. I'll hurry on so they can see your  dress; it's just too lovely for anything."    
Betty wore a white embroidered chiffon over green; she shook out the  train, which had been over her arm ever since she entered the house.  Her name was announced in a loud tone, and she entered the pretty  flowery Blue Room with its charmingly dressed receiving party standing  before a large group of favoured and critical friends, and facing the  inquisitive eyes in the central doorway. The President grasped her  hand and said, "How do you do, Miss Madison?" in so pleased and so  cordial a tone that Betty for a fleeting moment wondered where she  could have met him before. Then she smiled, made a comprehensive bow  to his wife and the women of the Cabinet, and passed on. Mrs. Mudd,  who had shaken hands relentlessly with every weary member of the  receiving party, reached the door of exit after her and clutched her  by the arm.    
"Say!" she exclaimed with excitement, although her drawl was but half  conquered. "Where <i>do</i> you s'pose I could have met the President  before? I know by the way he said 'Mrs. Mudd,' he remembered me, but I  just can't think, to save my life. My! ain't he fascinating?"    
Betty had laughed aloud. "I am sorry to hurt your vanity," she  replied, "but the President is said to have the best manners of any  man who has occupied the White House within living memory."    
"What d'you mean?" cried Mrs. Mudd, sharply. "D' you mean he didn't  know me? I just know he did, so there! And he can pack his clothes in  my trunk as soon as he likes."    
"Good heaven!"  "Oh, that's slang. I forgot you were so terrible superior. But you've  got good cause to know I'm virtuous. Lands sakes! I guess nobody ever  said I warn't."    
"I don't fancy anybody ever did."    
They were in the East Room again, with the stars and stripes, the  moving glitter of gold, the loud hum mingled with the distant strains  of martial music.    
"It's really inspiring," said Lady Mary. "I wish I could write a war  poem."    
"I hope there is nothing coming to inspire war doggerel; the prospect  of a new crop of war stories and war plays is too painful. We were all  brought up on the Civil War and are resigned to its literature. But  life is too short to get used to a new variety."    
"Betty dear, ennui has embittered you, and I must confess that I am a  trifle weary of the war before it has begun, myself. Randolph, I think  I prefer you should vote for peace."    
"I'm afraid we'll have no peace till we've had war first," said Mr.  Montgomery, grimly.    
"Oh, we're goin' to have war," drawled Mrs. Mudd. "Just don't you  worry about that. Now don't blush," she said in Betty's ear. "Senator  North's makin' straight for you. I suspicion you like him better 'n  Burleigh--"    
Betty had turned upon her at last, and the woman tittered nervously  and fell back in the crowd.    
Senator North and Miss Madison shook hands with that absence of  emotion which is one of the conditions of a crowded environment, and  Lady Mary suggested they should all go to the conservatory, where it  was cooler.    
Betty told Senator North of the impression the Army and Navy men had  made on her, and he laughed.    
"Of course they are not excited and say little," he said. "They will  do the acting and leave the talking to the private citizens. The only  argument in favour of the war and the large standing army which might  be its consequence is that several hundred thousand more men would  have disciplined brains inside their skulls."    
"That dreadful housekeeper I had in the Adirondacks is here, married  to a Representative named George Washington Mudd."    
"I never heard of him, but I am sorry she has come here to remind you  of what I should like to have you forget for a time. I do believe a  specimen of every queer fish in the country comes to this pond."    
They passed one of the bands, and conversation was impossible until  they entered the great conservatory with its wide cool walks among the  green. It was not crowded, and although there was no seclusion in it  at any time, its lights were few and it had a sequestered atmosphere.    
Betty and Senator North involuntarily drew closer together.    
"In a way I am happy now," she said. "It is something to be with you  and close to you. I will not think of how much this may lack until I  am alone again and there is no limit to my wants."    
"I feel the reverse of depressed," he said, smiling. "Are you quite  well? You look a little tired."    
"I am tired with much thinking; but that is inevitable. One cannot  love hopelessly and look one's best. I always despised the heroines of  romance who went into a decline, but Nature demands some tribute in  spite of the strongest will."    
He held her arm more closely, but he set his lips and did not answer.  She spoke again after a moment.    
"Since that night I have not been nearly so unhappy, however. I even  feel gay sometimes, and my sense of humour has come back. It would be  quite dreadful to go through life without that, but I thought I had  lost it."    
He had turned his eyes and was regarding her intently; but much as she  loved them she felt as helpless as ever before their depths. They  could pierce and burn, but they never were limpid for a moment.    
"You do not misunderstand that?" she asked hurriedly. "It does not  mean that I love you less, but more, if anything. And I am not  resigned! Only, I feel as if in some way I had received a little help,  as if--I cannot express it."    
"I understand you perfectly. We are a little closer than we were, and  life is not quite so grey."    
"That is it. And I would supplement your bare statement of the fact,  if I dared."    
"If you do, I certainly shall kiss you right here in the crowd," he  said, and they smiled into each other's eyes. There was little need of  explanations between them.    
"That would form a brief diversion for Washington. And as for Mrs.  Mudd--By the way, I hope I am not going off. You are the second person  who has told me that I am not looking well."    
"You are improved as far as I am concerned. And if you ever faded,  happiness would restore you at once. If happiness never came, perhaps  you would not care--would you?"    
She shrugged her beautiful shoulders and smiled quizzically.    
"I don't know. <i>Je suis femme</i>. I think I might always find some  measure of consolation in the mirror if it behaved properly."    
"Your sincerity is one of your charms. So walk and eat and live in the  world, and think as little as you can."    
"This conservatory is fearfully draughty," remarked Lady Mary, close  to Betty's shoulder. "I don't want to stay all night, do you?"    
"I am ready," said Betty; but she sighed, for she had been almost  happy for the hour.
