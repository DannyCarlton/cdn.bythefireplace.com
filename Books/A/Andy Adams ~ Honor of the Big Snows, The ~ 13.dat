  Nineteen years before these same rumors had come up from the south,   and the Red Terror had followed. The horror of it still remained with   the forest people; for a thousand unmarked graves, shunned like a   pestilence, and scattered from the lower waters of James Bay to the   lake country of the Athabasca, gave evidence of the toll it demanded. 
  From DuBrochet, on Reindeer Lake, authentic word first came to Lac   Bain early in the winter. Henderson was factor there, and he passed up   the warning that had come to him from Nelson House and the country to   the southeast. 
  &quot;There's smallpox on the Nelson,&quot; his messenger informed Williams,   &quot;and it has struck the Crees on Wollaston Lake. God only knows what it   is doing to the bay Indians, but we hear that it is wiping out the   Chippewayans between the Albany and the Churchill.&quot; He left the same   day with his winded dogs. &quot;I'm off for the R&eacute;villon people to the   west, with the compliments of our company,&quot; he explained. 
  Three days later, word came from Churchill that all of the  company's  servants and her majesty's subjects west of the bay should  prepare  themselves for the coming of the Red Terror. Williams' thick  face went  as white as the paper he held, as he read the words of the  Churchill  factor. 
  &quot;It means dig graves,&quot; he said. &quot;That's the only preparation we can   make!&quot; 
  He read the paper aloud to the men at Lac Bain, and every available   man was detailed to spread the warning throughout the post's   territory. There was a quick harnessing of dogs, and on each sledge   that went out was a roll of red cotton cloth. Williams' face was still   white as he passed these rolls out from the company's store. They were   ominous of death, lurid signals of pestilence and horror, and the   touch of them sent shuddering chills through the men who were about to   scatter them among the forest people. 
  Jan went over the Churchill trail, and then swung southward along  the  Hasabala, where the country was crisscrossed with trap-lines of  the  half-breeds and the French. First, he struck the cabin of Croisset  and  his wife, and left part of his cloth. Then he turned westward,  while  Croisset harnessed his dogs and hurried with a quarter of the  roll to  the south. Between the Hasabala and Klokol Lake, Jan found  three other  cabins, and at each he left a bit of the red cotton. Forty  miles to  the south, somewhere on the Porcupine, were the lines of  Henry  Langlois, the post's greatest fox-hunter. On the morning of the  third  day, Jan set off in search of Langlois; and late in the  afternoon of  the same day he came upon a well-beaten snow-shoe trail.  On this he  camped until morning. When dawn came he began following it. 
  He passed half a dozen of Langlois' trap-houses. In none of them  was  there bait. In three the traps were sprung. In the seventh he  found  the remains of a red fox that had been eaten until there was  little  but the bones left. Two houses beyond there was an ermine in a  trap,  with its head eaten off. With growing perplexity, Jan examined  the  snow-shoe trails in the snow. The most recent of them were days  old.  He urged on his dogs, stopping no more at the trap-houses, until,  with  a shrieking command, he brought them to a halt at the edge of a   clearing cut in the forest. A dozen rods ahead of him was the   trapper's cabin. Over it, hanging limply to a sapling pole, was the   red signal of horror. 
  With a terrified cry to the dogs, Jan ran back, and the team turned   about and followed him in a tangled mass. Then he stopped. There was   no smoke rising from the clay chimney on the little cabin. Its one   window was white with frost. Again and again he shouted, but no sign   of life responded to his cries. He fired his rifle twice, and waited   with his mittened hand over his mouth and nostrils. There was no   reply. Then, abandoning hope, he turned back into the north, and gave   his dogs no rest until he had reached Lac Bain. 
  His team came in half dead. Both Cummins and Williams rushed out to   meet him as he drove up before the company's store. 
  &quot;The red flag is over Langlois' cabin!&quot; he cried. &quot;I fired my rifle   and shouted. There is no life! Langlois is dead!&quot; 
  &quot;Great God!&quot; groaned Williams. 
  His red face changed to a sickly pallor, and he stood with his  thick  hands clenched, while Cummins took charge of the dogs and Jan  went  into the store for something to eat. 
  Mukee and Per-ee returned to the post the next day. Young Williams   followed close after them, filled with terror. He had found the plague   among the Crees of the Waterfound. 
  Each day added to the gloom at Lac Bain. For a time Jan could not   fully understand, and he still played his violin and romped joyfully   with M&eacute;lisse in the little cabin. He had not lived through the plague   of nineteen years before. Most of the others had, even to Mukee, the   youngest of them all. 
  Jan did not know that it was this Red Terror that came like a  Nemesis  of the gods to cut down the people of the great Northland,  until they  were fewer in number than those of the Sahara desert. But  he learned  quickly. In February, the Crees along Wollaston Lake were  practically  wiped out. Red flags marked the trail of the Nelson. Death  leaped from  cabin to cabin in the wilderness to the west. By the  middle of the  month, Lac Bain was hemmed in by the plague on all sides  but the  north. 
  The post's trap-lines had been shortened; now they were abandoned   entirely, and the great fight began. Williams assembled his men, and   told them how that same battle had been fought nearly two decades   before. For sixty miles about the post every cabin and wigwam that   floated a red flag must be visited&#8212;and burned if the occupants were   dead. In learning whether life or death existed in these places lay   the peril for those who undertook the task. It was a dangerous   mission. It meant facing a death from which those who listened to the   old factor shrank with dread; yet, when the call came, they responded   to a man. 
  Cummins and Jan ate their last supper together, with M&eacute;lisse  sitting  between them and wondering at their silence. When it was over,  the two  went outside. 
  &quot;Mukee wasn't at the store,&quot; said Cummins in a thick, strained  voice,  halting Jan in the gloom behind the cabin. &quot;Williams thought he  was  off to the south with his dogs. But he isn't. I saw him drag  himself  into his shack, like a sick dog, an hour before dusk. There'll  be a  red flag over Lac Bain in the morning.&quot; 
  Jan stifled the sharp cry on his lips. 
  &quot;Ah, there's a light!&quot; cried Cummins. &quot;It's a pitch torch burning  in  front of his door!&quot; 
  A shrill, quavering cry came from the direction of Mukee's cabin,  and  the two recognized it as the voice of the half-breed's father&#8212;a   wordless cry, rising and dying away again and again, like the wailing   of a dog. Sudden lights flashed into the night, as they had flashed   years ago when Cummins staggered forth from his home with word of the   woman's death. He gripped Jan's arm in a sudden spasm of horror. 
  &quot;The flag is up NOW!&quot; he whispered huskily. &quot;Go back to M&eacute;lisse.  There  is food in the house for a month, and you can bring the wood in  to-  night. Bar the door. Open only the back window for air. Stay  inside&#8212;  with her&#8212;until it is all over. Go!&quot; 
  &quot;To the red flags, that is where I will go!&quot; cried Jan fiercely,   wrenching his arm free. &quot;It is your place to stay with M&eacute;lisse!&quot; 
  &quot;My place is with the men.&quot; 
  &quot;And mine?&quot; Jan drew himself up rigid. 
  &quot;One of us must shut himself up with her,&quot; pleaded Cummins. &quot;It  must  be you.&quot; His face gleamed white in the darkness. &quot;You came&#8212;that   night&#8212;because M&eacute;lisse was here. SOMETHING sent you&#8212;SOMETHING&#8212;don't   you understand? And since then she has never been near to death until   now. You must stay with M&eacute;lisse&#8212;WITH YOUR VIOLIN!&quot; 
  &quot;M&eacute;lisse herself shall choose,&quot; replied Jan. &quot;We will go into the   cabin, and the one to whom she comes first goes among the red flags.   The other shuts himself in the cabin until the plague is gone.&quot; 
  He turned swiftly back to the door. As he opened it, he stepped  aside  to let Cummins enter first, and behind the other's broad back he   leaped quickly to one side, his eyes glowing, his white teeth gleaming   in a smile. Unseen by Cummins, he stretched out his arms to M&eacute;lisse,   who was playing with the strings of his violin on the table. 
  He had done this a thousand times, and M&eacute;lisse knew what it  meant&#8212;a  kiss and a joyous toss halfway to the ceiling. She jumped  from her  stool and ran to him; but this time, instead of hoisting her  above his  head, he hugged her up close to his breast, and buried his  face in her  soft hair. His eyes looked over her in triumph to Cummins. 
  &quot;Up, Jan, up&#8212;'way up!&quot; cried M&eacute;lisse. 
  He tossed her until she half turned in midair, kissed her again as  he  caught her in his arms, and set her, laughing and happy, on the  edge  of the table. 
  &quot;I am going down among the sick Crees in Cummins' place,&quot; said Jan  to  Williams, half an hour later. &quot;Now that the plague has come to Lac   Bain, he must stay with M&eacute;lisse.&quot;
