How much precisely Charles dropped over the slump in Cloetedorps  I never quite knew. But the incident left him dejected, limp, and  dispirited.    
"Hang it all, Sey," he said to me in the smoking-room, a few  evenings later. "This Colonel Clay is enough to vex the patience of  Job--and Job had large losses, too, if I recollect aright, from the  Chaldeans and other big operators of the period."    
"Three thousand camels," I murmured, recalling my dear mother's  lessons; "all at one fell swoop; not to mention five hundred yoke of  oxen, carried off by the Sabeans, then a leading firm of speculative  cattle-dealers!"    
"Ah, well," Charles meditated aloud, shaking the ash from his  cheroot into a Japanese tray--fine antique bronze-work. "There were  big transactions in live-stock even then! Still, Job or no Job, the  man is too much for me."    
"The difficulty is," I assented, "you never know where to have him."    
"Yes," Charles mused; "if he were always the same, like Horniman's  tea or a good brand of whisky, it would be easier, of course; you'd  stand some chance of spotting him. But when a man turns up smiling  every time in a different disguise, which fits him like a skin, and  always apparently with the best credentials, why, hang it all, Sey,  there's no wrestling with him anyhow."    
"Who could have come to us, for example, better vouched," I  acquiesced, "than the Honourable David?"    
"Exactly so," Charles murmured. "I invited him myself, for my own  advantage. And he arrived with all the prestige of the Glen-Ellachie  connection."    
"Or the Professor?" I went on. "Introduced to us by the leading  mineralogist of England."    
I had touched a sore point. Charles winced and remained silent.    
"Then, women again," he resumed, after a painful pause. "I must meet  in society many charming women. I can't everywhere and always be on  my guard against every dear soul of them. Yet the moment I relax  my attention for one day--or even when I don't relax it--I am  bamboozled and led a dance by that arch Mme. Picardet, or that  transparently simple little minx, Mrs. Granton. She's the cleverest  girl I ever met in my life, that hussy, whatever we're to call her.  She's a different person each time; and each time, hang it all, I  lose my heart afresh to that different person."    
I glanced round to make sure Amelia was well out of earshot.    
"No, Sey," my respected connection went on, after another long  pause, sipping his coffee pensively, "I feel I must be aided in this  superhuman task by a professional unraveller of cunning disguises. I  shall go to Marvillier's to-morrow--fortunate man, Marvillier--and  ask him to supply me with a really good 'tec, who will stop in the  house and keep an eye upon every living soul that comes near me.  He shall scan each nose, each eye, each wig, each whisker. He shall  be my watchful half, my unsleeping self; it shall be his business  to suspect all living men, all breathing women. The Archbishop of  Canterbury shall not escape for a moment his watchful regard; he  will take care that royal princesses don't collar the spoons or walk  off with the jewel-cases. He must see possible Colonel Clays in the  guard of every train and the parson of every parish; he must detect  the off-chance of a Mme. Picardet in every young girl that takes tea  with Amelia, every fat old lady that comes to call upon Isabel. Yes,  I have made my mind up. I shall go to-morrow and secure such a man  at once at Marvillier's."    
"If you please, Sir Charles," Cesarine interposed, pushing her head  through the portiere, "her ladyship says, will you and Mr. Wentworth  remember that she goes out with you both this evening to Lady  Carisbrooke's?"    
"Bless my soul," Charles cried, "so she does! And it's now past ten!  The carriage will be at the door for us in another five minutes!"    
Next morning, accordingly, Charles drove round to Marvillier's. The  famous detective listened to his story with glistening eyes; then he  rubbed his hands and purred. "Colonel Clay!" he said; "Colonel Clay!  That's a very tough customer! The police of Europe are on the  look-out for Colonel Clay. He is wanted in London, in Paris, in  Berlin. It is le Colonel Caoutchouc here, le Colonel Caoutchouc  there; till one begins to ask, at last, <i>is</i> there <i>any</i> Colonel  Caoutchouc, or is it a convenient class name invented by the Force  to cover a gang of undiscovered sharpers? However, Sir Charles, we  will do our best. I will set on the track without delay the best and  cleverest detective in England."    
"The very man I want," Charles said. "What name, Marvillier?"    
The principal smiled. "Whatever name you like," he said. "He isn't  particular. Medhurst he's called at home. <i>We</i> call him Joe. I'll  send him round to your house this afternoon for certain."    
"Oh no," Charles said promptly, "you won't; or Colonel Clay himself  will come instead of him. I've been sold too often. No casual  strangers! I'll wait here and see him."    
"But he isn't in," Marvillier objected.    
Charles was firm as a rock. "Then send and fetch him."    
In half an hour, sure enough, the detective arrived. He was an  odd-looking small man, with hair cut short and standing straight up  all over his head, like a Parisian waiter. He had quick, sharp eyes,  very much like a ferret's; his nose was depressed, his lips thin and  bloodless. A scar marked his left cheek--made by a sword-cut, he  said, when engaged one day in arresting a desperate French smuggler,  disguised as an officer of Chasseurs d'Afrique. His mien was  resolute. Altogether, a quainter or 'cuter little man it has never  yet been my lot to set eyes on. He walked in with a brisk step,  eyed Charles up and down, and then, without much formality, asked  for what he was wanted.    
"This is Sir Charles Vandrift, the great diamond king," Marvillier  said, introducing us.    
"So I see," the man answered.    
"Then you know me?" Charles asked.    
"I wouldn't be worth much," the detective replied, "if I didn't  know everybody. And you're easy enough to know; why, every boy in  the street knows you."    
"Plain spoken!" Charles remarked.    
"As you like it, sir," the man answered in a respectful tone. "I  endeavour to suit my dress and behaviour on every occasion to the  taste of my employers."    
"Your name?" Charles asked, smiling.    
"Joseph Medhurst, at your service. What sort of work? Stolen  diamonds? Illicit diamond-buying?"    
"No," Charles answered, fixing him with his eye. "Quite another kind  of job. You've heard of Colonel Clay?"    
Medhurst nodded. "Why, certainly," he said; and, for the first time,  I detected a lingering trace of American accent. "It's my business  to know about him."    
"Well, I want you to catch him," Charles went on.    
Medhurst drew a long breath. "Isn't that rather a large order?"  he murmured, surprised.    
Charles explained to him exactly the sort of services he required.  Medhurst promised to comply. "If the man comes near you, I'll spot  him," he said, after a moment's pause. "I can promise you that much.  I'll pierce any disguise. I should know in a minute whether he's  got up or not. I'm death on wigs, false moustaches, artificial  complexions. I'll engage to bring the rogue to book if I see him.  You may set your mind at rest, that, while <i>I'm</i> about you, Colonel  Clay can do nothing without my instantly spotting him."    
"He'll do it," Marvillier put in. "He'll do it, if he says it. He's  my very best hand. Never knew any man like him for unravelling and  unmasking the cleverest disguises."    
"Then he'll suit me," Charles answered, "for <i>I</i> never knew any man  like Colonel Clay for assuming and maintaining them."    
It was arranged accordingly that Medhurst should take up his  residence in the house for the present, and should be described to  the servants as assistant secretary. He came that very day, with a  marvellously small portmanteau. But from the moment he arrived,  we noticed that Cesarine took a violent dislike to him.    
Medhurst was a most efficient detective. Charles and I told him  all we knew about the various shapes in which Colonel Clay had  "materialised," and he gave us in turn many valuable criticisms and  suggestions. Why, when we began to suspect the Honourable David  Granton, had we not, as if by accident, tried to knock his red wig  off? Why, when the Reverend Richard Peploe Brabazon first discussed  the question of the paste diamonds, had we not looked to see if  any of Amelia's unique gems were missing? Why, when Professor  Schleiermacher made his bow to assembled science at Lancaster Gate,  had we not strictly inquired how far he was personally known  beforehand to Sir Adolphus Cordery and the other mineralogists?  He supplied us also with several good hints about false hair and  make-up; such as that Schleiermacher was probably much shorter than  he looked, but by imitating a stoop with padding at his back he  had produced the illusion of a tall bent man, though in reality no  bigger than the little curate or the Graf von Lebenstein. High heels  did the rest; while the scientific keenness we noted in his face was  doubtless brought about by a trifle of wax at the end of the nose,  giving a peculiar tilt that is extremely effective. In short, I must  frankly admit, Medhurst made us feel ashamed of ourselves. Sharp as  Charles is, we realised at once he was nowhere in observation beside  the trained and experienced senses of this professional detective.    
The worst of it all was, while Medhurst was with us, by some curious  fatality, Colonel Clay stopped away from us. Now and again, to be  sure, we ran up against somebody whom Medhurst suspected; but  after a short investigation (conducted, I may say, with admirable  cleverness), the spy always showed us the doubtful person was  really some innocent and well-known character, whose antecedents  and surroundings he elucidated most wonderfully. He was a perfect  marvel, too, in his faculty of suspicion. He suspected everybody. If  an old friend dropped in to talk business with Charles, we found out  afterwards that Medhurst had lain concealed all the time behind the  curtain, and had taken short-hand notes of the whole conversation,  as well as snap-shot photographs of the supposed sharper, by means  of a kodak. If a fat old lady came to call upon Amelia, Medhurst  was sure to be lurking under the ottoman in the drawing-room, and  carefully observing, with all his eyes, whether or not she was  really Mme. Picardet, padded. When Lady Tresco brought her four  plain daughters to an "At Home" one night, Medhurst, in evening  dress, disguised as a waiter, followed them each round the room with  obtrusive ices, to satisfy himself just how much of their complexion  was real, and how much was patent rouge and Bloom of Ninon. He  doubted whether Simpson, Sir Charles's valet, was not Colonel Clay  in plain clothes; and he had half an idea that Cesarine herself was  our saucy White Heather in an alternative avatar. We pointed out  to him in vain that Simpson had often been present in the very  same room with David Granton, and that Cesarine had dressed Mrs.  Brabazon's hair at Lucerne: this partially satisfied him, but only  partially. He remarked that Simpson might double both parts with  somebody else unknown; and that as for Cesarine, she might well  have a twin sister who took her place when she was Mme. Picardet.    
Still, in spite of all his care--or because of all his care--Colonel  Clay stopped away for whole weeks together. An explanation occurred  to us. Was it possible he knew we were guarded and watched? Was he  afraid of measuring swords with this trained detective?    
If so, how had he found it out? I had an inkling, myself--but, under  all the circumstances, I did not mention it to Charles. It was clear  that Cesarine intensely disliked this new addition to the Vandrift  household. She would not stop in the room where the detective was,  or show him common politeness. She spoke of him always as "that  odious man, Medhurst." Could she have guessed, what none of the  other servants knew, that the man was a spy in search of the  Colonel? I was inclined to believe it. And then it dawned upon me  that Cesarine had known all about the diamonds and their story; that  it was Cesarine who took us to see Schloss Lebenstein; that it was  Cesarine who posted the letter to Lord Craig-Ellachie! If Cesarine  was in league with Colonel Clay, as I was half inclined to surmise,  what more natural than her obvious dislike to the detective who was  there to catch her principal? What more simple for her than to warn  her fellow-conspirator of the danger that awaited him if he  approached this man Medhurst?    
However, I was too much frightened by the episode of the cheque to  say anything of my nascent suspicions to Charles. I waited rather  to see how events would shape themselves.    
After a while Medhurst's vigilance grew positively annoying. More  than once he came to Charles with reports and shorthand notes  distinctly distasteful to my excellent brother-in-law. "The fellow  is getting to know too much about us," Charles said to me one day.  "Why, Sey, he spies out everything. Would you believe it, when I had  that confidential interview with Brookfield the other day, about the  new issue of Golcondas, the man was under the easy-chair, though I  searched the room beforehand to make sure he wasn't there; and he  came to me afterwards with full notes of the conversation, to assure  me he thought Brookfield--whom I've known for ten years--was too  tall by half an inch to be one of Colonel Clay's impersonations."    
"Oh, but, Sir Charles," Medhurst cried, emerging suddenly from the  bookcase, "you must never look upon <i>any one</i> as above suspicion  merely because you've known him for ten years or thereabouts.  Colonel Clay may have approached you at various times under many  disguises. He may have built up this thing gradually. Besides, as to  my knowing too much, why, of course, a detective always learns many  things about his employer's family which he is not supposed to know;  but professional honour and professional etiquette, as with doctors  and lawyers, compel him to lock them up as absolute secrets in his  own bosom. You need never be afraid I will divulge one jot of them.  If I did, my occupation would be gone, and my reputation shattered."    
Charles looked at him, appalled. "Do you dare to say," he burst out,  "you've been listening to my talk with my brother-in-law and  secretary?"    
"Why, of course," Medhurst answered. "It's my business to listen,  and to suspect everybody. If you push me to say so, how do I know  Colonel Clay is not--Mr. Wentworth?"    
Charles withered him with a look. "In future, Medhurst," he said,  "you must never conceal yourself in a room where I am without my  leave and knowledge."    
Medhurst bowed politely. "Oh, as you will, Sir Charles," he  answered; "that's <i>quite</i> at your own wish. Though how can I act  as an efficient detective, any way, if you insist upon tying my  hands like that, beforehand?"    
Again I detected a faint American flavour.    
After that rebuff, however, Medhurst seemed put upon his mettle. He  redoubled his vigilance in every direction. "It's not my fault," he  said plaintively, one day, "if my reputation's so good that, while  I'm near you, this rogue won't approach you. If I can't <i>catch</i> him,  at least I keep him away from coming near you!"    
A few days later, however, he brought Charles some photographs.  These he produced with evident pride. The first he showed us was a  vignette of a little parson. "Who's that, then?" he inquired, much  pleased.    
We gazed at it, open-eyed. One word rose to our lips simultaneously:  "Brabazon!"    
"And how's this for high?" he asked again, producing another--the  photograph of a gay young dog in a Tyrolese costume.    
We murmured, "Von Lebenstein!"    
"<i>And</i> this?" he continued, showing us the portrait of a lady with a  most fetching squint.    
We answered with one voice, "Little Mrs. Granton!"    
Medhurst was naturally proud of this excellent exploit. He replaced  them in his pocket-book with an air of just triumph.    
"How did you get them?" Charles asked.    
Medhurst's look was mysterious. "Sir Charles," he answered, drawing  himself up, "I must ask you to trust me awhile in this matter.  Remember, there are people whom you decline to suspect. <i>I</i> have  learned that it is always those very people who are most dangerous  to capitalists. If I were to give you the names now, you would  refuse to believe me. Therefore, I hold them over discreetly for  the moment. One thing, however, I say. I <i>know</i> to a certainty where  Colonel Clay is at this present speaking. But I will lay my plans  deep, and I hope before long to secure him. You shall be present  when I do so; and I shall make him confess his personality openly.  More than that you cannot reasonably ask. I shall leave it to  <i>you</i>, then, whether or not you wish to arrest him."    
Charles was considerably puzzled, not to say piqued, by this curious  reticence; he begged hard for names; but Medhurst was adamant. "No,  no," he replied; "we detectives have our own just pride in our  profession. If I told you now, you would probably spoil all by some  premature action. You are too open and impulsive! I will mention  this alone: Colonel Clay will be shortly in Paris, and before long  will begin from that city a fresh attempt at defrauding you, which  he is now hatching. Mark my words, and see whether or not I have  been kept well informed of the fellow's movements!"    
He was perfectly correct. Two days later, as it turned out, Charles  received a "confidential" letter from Paris, purporting to come  from the head of a second-rate financial house with which he had  had dealings over the Craig-Ellachie Amalgamation--by this time,  I ought to have said, an accomplished union. It was a letter of  small importance in itself--a mere matter of detail; but it paved  the way, so Medhurst thought, to some later development of more  serious character. Here once more the man's singular foresight was  justified. For, in another week, we received a second communication,  containing other proposals of a delicate financial character, which  would have involved the transference of some two thousand pounds  to the head of the Parisian firm at an address given. Both these  letters Medhurst cleverly compared with those written to Charles  before, in the names of Colonel Clay and of Graf von Lebenstein.  At first sight, it is true, the differences between the two seemed  quite enormous: the Paris hand was broad and black, large and bold;  while the earlier manuscript was small, neat, thin, and gentlemanly.  Still, when Medhurst pointed out to us certain persistent twists in  the formation of his capitals, and certain curious peculiarities in  the relative length of his t's, his l's, his b's, and his h's, we  could see for ourselves he was right; both were the work of one hand,  writing in the one case with a sharp-pointed nib, very small, and in  the other with a quill, very large and freely.    
This discovery was <i>most</i> important. We stood now within measurable  distance of catching Colonel Clay, and bringing forgery and fraud  home to him without hope of evasion.    
To make all sure, however, Medhurst communicated with the Paris  police, and showed us their answers. Meanwhile, Charles continued to  write to the head of the firm, who had given a private address in  the Rue Jean Jacques, alleging, I must say, a most clever reason why  the negotiations at this stage should be confidentially conducted.  But one never expected from Colonel Clay anything less than  consummate cleverness. In the end, it was arranged that we three  were to go over to Paris together, that Medhurst was to undertake,  under the guise of being Sir Charles, to pay the two thousand pounds  to the pretended financier, and that Charles and I, waiting with the  police outside the door, should, at a given signal, rush in with our  forces and secure the criminal.    
We went over accordingly, and spent the night at the Grand, as is  Charles's custom. The Bristol, which I prefer, he finds too quiet.  Early next morning we took a fiacre and drove to the Rue Jean  Jacques. Medhurst had arranged everything in advance with the Paris  police, three of whom, in plain clothes, were waiting at the foot  of the staircase to assist us. Charles had further provided himself  with two thousand pounds, in notes of the Bank of France, in order  that the payment might be duly made, and no doubt arise as to the  crime having been perpetrated as well as meditated--in the former  case, the penalty would be fifteen years; in the latter, three only.  He was in very high spirits. The fact that we had tracked the rascal  to earth at last, and were within an hour of apprehending him, was  in itself enough to raise his courage greatly. We found, as we  expected, that the number given in the Rue Jean Jacques was that  of an hotel, not a private residence. Medhurst went in first, and  inquired of the landlord whether our man was at home, at the same  time informing him of the nature of our errand, and giving him to  understand that if we effected the capture by his friendly aid, Sir  Charles would see that the expenses incurred on the swindler's bill  were met in full, as the price of his assistance. The landlord  bowed; he expressed his deep regret, as M. le Colonel--so we  heard him call him--was a most amiable person, much liked by the  household; but justice, of course, must have its way; and, with a  regretful sigh, he undertook to assist us.    
The police remained below, but Charles and Medhurst were each  provided with a pair of handcuffs. Remembering the Polperro case,  however, we determined to use them with the greatest caution. We  would only put them on in case of violent resistance. We crept up to  the door where the miscreant was housed. Charles handed the notes in  an open envelope to Medhurst, who seized them hastily and held them  in his hands in readiness for action. We had a sign concerted.  Whenever he sneezed--which he could do in the most natural  manner--we were to open the door, rush in, and secure the criminal!    
He was gone for some minutes. Charles and I waited outside in  breathless expectation. Then Medhurst sneezed. We flung the door  open at once, and burst in upon the creature.    
Medhurst rose as we did so. He pointed with his finger. "<i>This</i> is  Colonel Clay!" he said; "keep him well in charge while I go down  to the door for the police to arrest him!"    
A gentlemanly man, about middle height, with a grizzled beard and a  well-assumed military aspect, rose at the same moment. The envelope  in which Charles had placed the notes lay on the table before him.  He clutched it nervously. "I am at a loss, gentlemen," he said, in  an excited voice, "to account for this interruption." He spoke with  a tremor, yet with all the politeness to which we were accustomed in  the little curate and the Honourable David.    
"No nonsense!" Charles exclaimed, in his authoritative way. "We know  who you are. We have found you out this time. You are Colonel Clay.  If you attempt to resist--take care--I will handcuff you!"    
The military gentleman gave a start. "Yes, I <i>am</i> Colonel Clay," he  answered. "On what charge do you arrest me?"    
Charles was bursting with wrath. The fellow's coolness seemed never  to desert him. "You <i>are</i> Colonel Clay!" he muttered. "You have the  unspeakable effrontery to stand there and admit it?"    
"Certainly," the Colonel answered, growing hot in turn. "I have done  nothing to be ashamed of. What do you mean by this conduct? How dare  you talk of arresting me?"    
Charles laid his hand on the man's shoulder. "Come, come, my  friend," he said. "That sort of bluff won't go down with us. You  know very well on what charge I arrest you; and here are the police  to give effect to it."    
He called out "Entrez!" The police entered the room. Charles  explained as well as he could in most doubtful Parisian what they  were next to do. The Colonel drew himself up in an indignant  attitude. He turned and addressed them in excellent French.    
"I am an officer in the service of her Britannic Majesty," he said.  "On what ground do you venture to interfere with me, messieurs?"    
The chief policeman explained. The Colonel turned to Charles.  "<i>Your</i> name, sir?" he inquired.    
"You know it very well," Charles answered. "I am Sir Charles  Vandrift; and, in spite of your clever disguise, I can instantly  recognise you. I know your eyes and ears. I can see the same man  who cheated me at Nice, and who insulted me on the island."    
"<i>You</i> Sir Charles Vandrift!" the rogue cried. "No, no, sir, you are  a madman!" He looked round at the police. "Take care what you do!"  he cried. "This is a raving maniac. I had business just now with Sir  Charles Vandrift, who quitted the room as these gentlemen entered.  This person is mad, and you, monsieur, I doubt not," bowing to me,  "you are, of course, his keeper."    
"Do not let him deceive you," I cried to the police, beginning to  fear that with his usual incredible cleverness the fellow would  even now manage to slip through our fingers. "Arrest him, as you  are told. <i>We</i> will take the responsibility." Though I trembled when  I thought of that cheque he held of mine.    
The chief of our three policemen came forward and laid his hand on  the culprit's shoulder. "I advise you, M. le Colonel," he said, in  an official voice, "to come with us quietly for the present. Before  the juge d'instruction we can enter at length into all these  questions."    
The Colonel, very indignant still--and acting the part  marvellously--yielded and went along with them.    
"Where's Medhurst?" Charles inquired, glancing round as we reached  the door. "I wish he had stopped with us."    
"You are looking for monsieur your friend?" the landlord inquired,  with a side bow to the Colonel. "He has gone away in a fiacre. He  asked me to give this note to you."    
He handed us a twisted note. Charles opened and read it. "Invaluable  man!" he cried. "Just hear what he says, Sey: 'Having secured  Colonel Clay, I am off now again on the track of Mme. Picardet.  She was lodging in the same house. She has just driven away; I know  to what place; and I am after her to arrest her. In blind haste,  MEDHURST.' That's smartness, <i>if</i> you like. Though, poor little woman,  I think he might have left her."    
"Does a Mme. Picardet stop here?" I inquired of the landlord,  thinking it possible she might have assumed again the same old  alias.    
He nodded assent. "Oui, oui, oui," he answered. "She has just driven  off, and monsieur your friend has gone posting after her."    
"Splendid man!" Charles cried. "Marvillier was quite right. He is  the prince of detectives!"    
We hailed a couple of fiacres, and drove off, in two detachments,  to the juge d'instruction. There Colonel Clay continued to brazen  it out, and asserted that he was an officer in the Indian Army, home  on six months' leave, and spending some weeks in Paris. He even  declared he was known at the Embassy, where he had a cousin an  attache; and he asked that this gentleman should be sent for at once  from our Ambassador's to identify him. The juge d'instruction  insisted that this must be done; and Charles waited in very bad  humour for the foolish formality. It really seemed as if, after all,  when we had actually caught and arrested our man, he was going by  some cunning device to escape us.    
After a delay of more than an hour, during which Colonel Clay  fretted and fumed quite as much as we did, the attache arrived. To  our horror and astonishment, he proceeded to salute the prisoner  most affectionately.    
"Halloa, Algy!" he cried, grasping his hand; "what's up? What do  these ruffians want with you?"    
It began to dawn upon us, then, what Medhurst had meant by  "suspecting everybody": the real Colonel Clay was no common  adventurer, but a gentleman of birth and high connections!    
The Colonel glared at us. "This fellow declares he's Sir Charles  Vandrift," he said sulkily. "Though, in fact, there are two of them.  And he accuses me of forgery, fraud, and theft, Bertie."    
The attache stared hard at us. "This <i>is</i> Sir Charles Vandrift," he  replied, after a moment. "I remember hearing him make a speech once  at a City dinner. And what charge have you to prefer, Sir Charles,  against my cousin?"    
"Your cousin?" Charles cried. "This is Colonel Clay, the notorious  sharper!"    
The attache smiled a gentlemanly and superior smile. "This is  Colonel Clay," he answered, "of the Bengal Staff Corps."    
It began to strike us there was something wrong somewhere.    
"But he has cheated me, all the same," Charles said--"at Nice two  years ago, and many times since; and this very day he has tricked me  out of two thousand pounds in French bank-notes, which he has now  about him!"    
The Colonel was speechless. But the attache laughed. "What he has  done to-day I don't know," he said; "but if it's as apocryphal as  what you say he did two years ago, you've a thundering bad case,  sir; for he was then in India, and I was out there, visiting him."    
"Where are the two thousand pounds?" Charles cried. "Why, you've got  them in your hand! You're holding the envelope!"    
The Colonel produced it. "This envelope," he said, "was left with me  by the man with short stiff hair, who came just before you, and who  announced himself as Sir Charles Vandrift. He said he was interested  in tea in Assam, and wanted me to join the board of directors of  some bogus company. These are his papers, I believe," and he handed  them to his cousin.    
"Well, I'm glad the notes are safe, anyhow," Charles murmured, in a  tone of relief, beginning to smell a rat. "Will you kindly return  them to me?"    
The attache turned out the contents of the envelope. They proved to  be prospectuses of bubble companies of the moment, of no importance.    
"Medhurst must have put them there," I cried, "and decamped with the  cash."    
Charles gave a groan of horror. "And Medhurst is Colonel Clay!" he  exclaimed, clapping his hand to his forehead.    
"I beg your pardon, sir," the Colonel interposed. "I have but one  personality, and no aliases."    
It took quite half an hour to explain this imbroglio. But as soon as  all was explained, in French and English, to the satisfaction of  ourselves and the juge d'instruction, the real Colonel shook hands  with us in a most forgiving way, and informed us that he had more  than once wondered, when he gave his name at shops in Paris, why  it was often received with such grave suspicion. We instructed  the police that the true culprit was Medhurst, whom they had seen  with their own eyes, and whom we urged them to pursue with all  expedition. Meanwhile, Charles and I, accompanied by the Colonel  and the attache--"to see the fun out," as they said--called at the  Bank of France for the purpose of stopping the notes immediately. It  was too late, however. They had been presented at once, and cashed  in gold, by a pleasant little lady in an American costume, who was  afterwards identified by the hotel-keeper (from our description) as  his lodger, Mme. Picardet. It was clear she had taken rooms in the  same hotel, to be near the Indian Colonel; and it was <i>she</i> who had  received and sent the letters. As for our foe, he had vanished into  space, as always.    
Two days later we received the usual insulting communication on a  sheet of Charles's own dainty note. Last time he wrote it was on  Craig-Ellachie paper: this time, like the wanton lapwing, he had got  himself another crest.    
"MOST PERSPICACIOUS OF MILLIONAIRES!--Said I not well, as  Medhurst, that you must distrust everybody? And the one man  you never dreamt of distrusting was--Medhurst. Yet see how  truthful I was! I told you I knew where Colonel Clay was  living--and I <i>did</i> know, exactly. I promised to take you to  Colonel Clay's rooms, and to get him arrested for you--and  I kept my promise. I even exceeded your expectations; for  I gave you <i>two</i> Colonel Clays instead of one--and you took  the wrong man--that is to say, the real one. This was a neat  little trick; but it cost me some trouble.    
"First, I found out there <i>was</i> a real Colonel Clay, in the  Indian Army. I also found out he chanced to be coming home on  leave this season. I might have made more out of him, no doubt;  but I disliked annoying him, and preferred to give myself the  fun of this peculiar mystification. I therefore waited for him  to reach Paris, where the police arrangements suited me better  than in London. While I was looking about, and delaying  operations for his return, I happened to hear you wanted a  detective. So I offered myself as out of work to my old  employer, Marvillier, from whom I have had many good jobs in the  past; and there you get, in short, the kernel of the Colonel.    
"Naturally, after this, I can never go back as a detective  to Marvillier's. But, on the large scale on which I have  learned to work since I first had the pleasure of making  your delightful acquaintance, this matters little. To say  the truth, I begin to feel detective work a cut or two below  me. I am now a gentleman of means and leisure. Besides, the  extra knowledge of your movements which I have acquired in  your house has helped still further to give me various holds  upon you. So the fluke will be true to his own pet lamb. To  vary the metaphor, you are not fully shorn yet.    
"Remember me most kindly to your charming family, give  Wentworth my love, and tell Mlle. Cesarine I owe her a grudge  which I shall never forget. She clearly suspected me. You are  much too rich, dear Charles; I relieve your plethora. I bleed  you financially. Therefore I consider myself--Your sincerest  friend,    
"CLAY-BRABAZON-MEDHURST,    
"Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons."    
Charles was threatened with apoplexy. This blow was severe.  "Whom can I trust," he asked, plaintively, "when the detectives  themselves, whom I employ to guard me, turn out to be swindlers?  Don't you remember that line in the Latin grammar--something about,  'Who shall watch the watchers?' I think it used to run, 'Quis  custodes custodiet ipsos?'"    
But I felt this episode had at least disproved my suspicions of  poor Cesarine.
