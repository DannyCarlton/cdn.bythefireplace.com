  The passing of Cummins' wife was as quiet as had been her coming.  With  bare heads, their shaggy hair falling wildly about their faces,  their  lips set tight to choke back their grief, the few at the post  went,  one by one, into the little cabin, and gazed for the last time  upon  her face. There was but one sound other than the gentle tread of  their  moccasined feet, and that was a catching, sobbing moan that fell  from  the thick gray beard of Williams, the old factor. 
  After that they carried her to where a clearing had been cut in the   edge of the forest; and at the foot of a giant spruce, towering   sentinel-like to the sky, they lowered her into the frozen earth.   Gaspingly, Williams stumbled over the words on a ragged page that had   been torn from a Bible. The rough men who stood about him bowed their   wild heads upon their breasts, and sobs broke from them. 
  At last Williams stopped his reading, stretched his long arms above   his head, and cried chokingly: 
  &quot;The great God keep Mees Cummins!&quot; 
  As the earth fell, there came from the edge of the forest the low,   sweet music of Jan Thoreau's violin. No man in all the world could   have told what he played, for it was the music of Jan's soul, wild and   whispering of the winds, sweetened by some strange inheritance that   had come to him with the picture which he carried in his throbbing   heart. 
  He played until only the tall spruce and John Cummins stood over  the  lone grave. When he stopped, the man turned to him, and they went   together to the little cabin where the woman had lived. 
  There was something new in the cabin now&#8212;a tiny, white, breathing   thing over which an Indian woman watched. The boy stood beside John   Cummins, looking down upon it, and trembling. 
  &quot;Ah,&quot; he whispered, his great eyes glowing. &quot;It ees the LEETLE  white  angel!&quot; 
  &quot;It is the little M&eacute;lisse,&quot; replied the man. 
  He dropped upon his knees, with his sad face close to the new life   that was to take the place of the one that had just gone out. Jan felt   something tugging in a strange way at his heart, and he, too, fell   upon his knees beside John Cummins in this first worship of the child. 
  From this hour of their first kneeling before the little life in  the  cabin, something sprang up between Jan Thoreau and John Cummins  which  it would have been hard for man to break. Looking up after many   moments' contemplation of the little M&eacute;lisse, Jan gazed straight into   Cummins' face, and whispered softly the word which in Cree means   &quot;father.&quot; This was Jan's first word for M&eacute;lisse. 
  When he looked back, the baby was wriggling and kicking as he had  seen  tiny wolf-whelps wriggle and kick before their eyes were open.  His  beautiful eyes laughed. As cautiously as if he were playing with  hot  iron, he reached out a thin hand, and when one of his fingers  suddenly  fell upon something very soft and warm, he jerked it back as  quickly  as if he had been burned. 
  That night, when Jan picked up his violin to go back to Mukee's  cabin,  Cummins put his two big hands on the boy's shoulders and said: 
  &quot;Jan, who are you, and where did you come from?&quot; 
  Jan stretched his arm vaguely to the north. 
  &quot;Jan Thoreau,&quot; he replied simply. &quot;Thees is my violon. We come  alone  through the beeg snow.&quot; 
  Cummins stared as if he saw a wonderful picture in the boy's eyes.  He  dropped his hands, and walked to the door. When they stood alone   outside, he pointed up to the stars, and to the mist-like veil of   silver light that the awakening aurora was spreading over the northern   skies. 
  &quot;Get your bearings, and tell me again where you came from, Jan!&quot; 
  Unhesitatingly the boy pointed into the north. 
  &quot;We starve seven day in the beeg snow. My violon keep the wolf off  at  night.&quot; 
  &quot;Look again, Jan! Didn't you come from there, or there, or there?&quot; 
  Cummins turned slowly, facing first to the east and Hudson's Bay,  then  to the south, and lastly to the west. There was something more  than  curiosity in the tense face that came back in staring inquiry to  Jan  Thoreau. 
  The boy hunched his shoulders, and his eyes flashed. 
  &quot;It ees not lie that Jan Thoreau and hees violon come through the  beeg  snow,&quot; he replied softly. &quot;It ees not lie!&quot; 
  There was more than gentleness in John Cummins' touch now. Jan  could  not understand it, but he yielded to it, and went back into the  cabin.  There was more than friendship in Cummins' eyes when he placed  his  hands again upon the boy's shoulders, and Jan could not understand   that. 
  &quot;There is plenty of room here&#8212;now,&quot; said Cummins huskily. &quot;Will  you  stay with the little M&eacute;lisse and me?&quot; 
  &quot;With the leetle M&eacute;lisse!&quot; gasped the boy. Softly he sped to the  tiny  cot and knelt beside it, his thin shoulders hunched over, his  long  black hair shining lustrously in the lamp-glow, his breath coming  in  quick, sobbing happiness. &quot;I&#8212;I&#8212;stay with the leetle white angel  for  ever and ever!&quot; he whispered, his words meant only for the  unhearing  ears of the child. &quot;Jan Thoreau will stay, yes&#8212;and hees  violon! I  give it to you&#8212;and ze museek!&quot; 
  He laid his precious violin across the foot of the cot.
