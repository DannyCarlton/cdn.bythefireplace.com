  Jotham Anderson, editor and publisher of the &#8220;Centreville Gazette,&#8221;  was sitting at his desk penning an editorial paragraph, when the office  door opened, and Harry Walton entered.
  &#8220;Good-morning, Mr. Anderson,&#8221; said our hero, removing his hat.
  &#8220;Good-morning, my friend. I believe you have the advantage of me,&#8221;  replied the editor.
  Our hero was taken aback. It didn't occur to him that the engagement  was a far less important event to the publisher than to himself. He  began to be afraid that the place had not been kept open for him.
  &#8220;My name is Harry Walton,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;I was travelling with  Prof. Henderson last winter, and called here to get some bills  printed.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh yes, I remember you now. I agreed to take you into the office,&#8221;  said the editor, to Harry's great relief.
  &#8220;Yes, air.&#8221;
  &#8220;You haven't changed your mind, then?&#8212;You still want to be a  printer?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;You have left the Professor, I suppose.&#8221;
  &#8220;I left him yesterday.&#8221;
  &#8220;What did he pay you?&#8221;
  &#8220;Five dollars a week. He offered me six, if I would stay with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Of course you know that I can't pay you any such wages at present.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir. You agreed to give me my board the first month, and two  dollars a week for six months afterward.&#8221;
  &#8220;That is all you will be worth to me at first. It is a good deal  less than you would earn with Professor Henderson.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know that, sir; but I am willing to come for that.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good. I see you are in earnest about printing, and that is a good  sign. I wanted you to understand just what you had to expect, so that  you need not be disappointed.&#8221;
  &#8220;I sha'n't be disappointed, sir,&#8221; said Harry confidently. &#8220;I have  made up my mind to be a printer, and if you didn't receive me into your  office, I would try to get in somewhere else.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then no more need be said. When do you want to begin?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am ready any time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where is your trunk?&#8221;
  &#8220;At the tavern.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can have it brought over to my house whenever you please. The  hotel-keeper will send it over for you. He is our expressman. Come into  the house now, and I will introduce you to my wife.&#8221;
  The editor's home was just across the street from his printing  office. Followed by Harry he crossed the street, opened the front door,  and led the way into the sitting-room, where a pleasant-looking lady of  middle age was seated.
  &#8220;My dear,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I bring you a new boarder.&#8221;
  She looked at Harry inquiringly.
  &#8220;This young man,&#8221; her husband explained, &#8220;is going into the office  to learn printing. I have taken a contract to make a second Benjamin  Franklin of him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you'll do more for him than you have been able to do for  yourself,&#8221; said Mrs. Anderson, smiling.
  &#8220;You are inclined to be severe, Mrs. Anderson, but I fear you are  correct. However, I can be like a guide-post, which points the way  which it does not travel. Can you show Harry Walton&#8212;for that is his  name&#8212;where you propose to put him?&#8221;
  &#8220;I am afraid I must give you a room in the attic,&#8221; said Mrs.  Anderson. &#8220;Our house is small, and all the chambers on the second floor  are occupied.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am not at all particular,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I have not been  accustomed to elegant accommodations.&#8221;
  &#8220;If you will follow me upstairs, I will show you your room.&#8221;
  Pausing on the third landing, Mrs. Anderson found the door of a  small but comfortable bed-room. There was no carpet on the floor, but  it was painted yellow, and scrupulously clean. A bed, two chairs, a  bureau and wash-stand completed the list of furniture.
  &#8220;I shall like this room very well,&#8221; said our hero.
  &#8220;There is a closet,&#8221; said the lady, pointing to a door in the  corner. &#8220;It is large enough to contain your trunk, if you choose to put  it in there. I hope you don't smoke.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, no, indeed,&#8221; said Harry, laughing. &#8220;I haven't got so far along  as that.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Anderson's last apprentice&#8212;he is a journeyman now&#8212;was a  smoker. He not only scented up the room, but as he was very careless  about lights, I was continually alarmed lest he should set the house on  fire. Finally, I got so nervous that I asked him to board somewhere  else.&#8221;
  &#8220;Is he working for Mr. Anderson now?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes; you probably saw him in the office.&#8221;
  &#8220;I saw two young men at the case.&#8221;
  &#8220;The one I speak of is the youngest. His name is John Clapp.&#8221;
  &#8220;There is no danger of my smoking. I don't think it would do me any  good. Besides, it is expensive, and I can't afford it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I see we think alike,&#8221; said Mrs. Anderson, smiling. &#8220;I am sure we  will get along well together.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall try not to give you any trouble,&#8221; said our hero, and his  tone, which was evidently sincere, impressed Mrs. Anderson still more  favorably.
  &#8220;You won't find me very hard to suit, I hope. I suppose you will be  here to supper?&#8221;
  &#8220;If it will he quite convenient. My trunk is at the tavern, and I  could stay there till morning, if you wished.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, no, come at once. Take possession of the room now, if you like,  and leave an order to have your trunk brought here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you. What is your hour for supper?&#8221;
  &#8220;Half-past five.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you. I will go over and speak to Mr. Anderson a minute.&#8221;
  The editor looked up as Harry reappeared.
  &#8220;Well, have you settled arrangements with Mrs. Anderson?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;Yes, sir, I believe so.&#8221;
  &#8220;I hope you like your room.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is very comfortable. It won't take me long to feel at home  there.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did she ask you whether you smoked?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;I thought she would. That's where Clapp and she fell out.&#8221;
  Harry's attention was drawn to a thin, sallow young man of about  twenty, who stood at a case on the opposite side of the room.
  &#8220;Mrs. Anderson was afraid I would set the house on fire,&#8221; said the  young man thus referred to.
  &#8220;Yes, she felt nervous about it. However, it is not surprising. An  uncle of hers lost his house in that way. I suppose you don't smoke,  Walton?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, sir.&#8221;
  &#8220;Clapp smokes for his health. You see how stout and robust he is,&#8221;  said the editor, a little satirically.
  &#8220;It doesn't do me any harm,&#8221; said Clapp, a little testily.
  &#8220;Oh, well, I don't interfere with you, though I think you would be  better off if you should give up the habit. Ferguson don't smoke.&#8221;
  This was the other compositor, a man of thirty, whose case was not  far distant from Clapp's.
  &#8220;I can't afford it,&#8221; said Ferguson; &#8220;nor could Clapp, if he had a  wife and two young children to support.&#8221;
  &#8220;Smoking doesn't cost much,&#8221; said the younger journeyman.
  &#8220;So you think; but did you ever reckon it up?&#8221;
  &#8220;No.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you keep any accounts?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; I spend when I need to, and I can always tell how much I have  left. What's the use of keeping accounts?&#8221;
  &#8220;You can tell how you stand.&#8221;
  &#8220;I can tell that without taking so much trouble.&#8221;
  &#8220;You see we must all agree to disagree,&#8221; said Mr. Anderson. &#8220;I am  afraid Clapp isn't going to be a second Benjamin Franklin.&#8221;
  &#8220;Who is?&#8221; asked Clapp.
  &#8220;Our young friend here,&#8221; said the editor.
  &#8220;Oh, is he?&#8221; queried the other with a sneer. &#8220;It'll be a great honor  I'm sure, to have him in the office.&#8221;
  &#8220;Come, no chaffing, Clapp,&#8221; said Mr. Anderson.
  Harry hastened to disclaim the charge, for Clapp's sneer affected  him disagreeably.
  &#8220;I admire Franklin,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but there isn't much danger of my  turning out a second edition of him.&#8221;
  &#8220;Professional already, I see, Walton,&#8221; said the editor.
  &#8220;When shall I go to work, Mr. Anderson?&#8221;
  &#8220;Whenever you are ready.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am ready now.&#8221;
  &#8220;You are prompt.&#8221;
  &#8220;You won't be in such a hurry to go to work a week hence,&#8221; said  Clapp.
  &#8220;I think I shall,&#8221; said Harry. &#8220;I am anxious to learn as fast as  possible.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, I forgot. You want to become a second Franklin.&#8221;
  &#8220;I sha'n't like him,&#8221; thought our hero. &#8220;He seems to try to make  himself disagreeable.&#8221;
  &#8220;Mr. Ferguson will give you some instruction, and set you to work,&#8221;  said his employer.
  Harry was glad that it was from the older journeyman that he was to  receive his first lesson, and not from the younger.
