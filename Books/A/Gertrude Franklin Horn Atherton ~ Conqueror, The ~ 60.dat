Hamilton, on his way home, stopped in at the chambers of Troup.    
"Bob," he said, "you are to wind up my law business. I am to be  Secretary of the Treasury."    
Troup half rose with an exclamation of impatience. "Good heavens!" he  exclaimed. "Have you not an introductory line in your nature? It has  been bad enough to have been anticipating this, without having it go  straight through one like a cannon-ball. Of course it is no use to  reason with you--I gave that up just after I had assumed that you were a  small boy whom it was the duty of a big collegian to protect, and you  nearly demolished my not too handsome visage with your astonishing  fists for contradicting you. But I am sorry. Remain at the bar and you  have an immediate prospect of wealth, not too many enemies, and the  highest honours. Five years from now, and you would lead not only the  bar of New York but of the whole country. Jay may be the first Chief  Justice, but you would be the second--."    
"Nothing would induce me to be Chief Justice. I should be bored to  death. Can you fancy me sitting eternally and solemnly in the middle of  a bench, listening to long-winded lawyers? While I live I shall have  action--."    
"Well, you will have action enough in this position; it will burn you  out twenty years before your time. And it will be the end of what peace  and happiness a born fighter could ever hope to possess; for you will  raise up enemies and critics on every side, you will be hounded, you  will be the victim of cabals, your good name will be assailed--."    
"Answer this: do you know of anyone who could fill this office as  advantageously to the country as I?"    
"No," said Troup, unwillingly. "I do not."    
Hamilton was standing by the table. He laid his hand on a volume of  Coke, expanding and contracting it slowly. It was perhaps the most  beautiful hand in America, and almost as famous as its owner. But as  Troup gazed at it he saw only its superhuman suggestion of strength.    
"The future of this country lies there," said Hamilton. "I know, and you  know, that my greatest gift is statesmanship; my widest, truest  knowledge is in the department of finance; moreover, that nothing has so  keen and enduring a fascination for me. I could no more refuse this  invitation of Washington's than I could clog the wheels of my mind to  inaction. It is like a magnet to steel. If I were sure of personal  consequences the most disastrous, I should accept, and without  hesitation. For what else was the peculiar quality of my brain given me?  To what other end have I studied this great question since I was a boy  of nineteen--wild as I was to fight and win the honours of the field?  Was ever a man's destiny clearer, or his duty?"    
"I have no more to say," said Troup, "but I regret it all the same.  Have you heard from Morris--Gouverneur?"    
"Oh, yes, I had a long screed, in almost your words, spiced with his own  particular impertinence. Will you wind up my law business?"    
"Oh, of course," said Troup.    
The new Congress, made up, though it was, of many of the ablest men in  the country, had inherited the dilatory methods of the old, and did not  pass an act establishing the Treasury Department until the 2d of  September. Hamilton's appointment to this most important portfolio at  the disposal of the President was looked upon as a matter of course. It  created little discussion, but so deep a feeling of security, that even  before the reading of his famous Report business had revived to some  extent. This Report upon the public credit was demanded of him at once,  but it was not until the recess of Congress that he could work  uninterruptedly upon it; for that body, floundering in its chaos of  inherited difficulties, turned to the new Secretary for advice on almost  every problem that beset it. I cannot do better here than to quote from  the monograph on Hamilton by Henry Cabot Lodge, who puts with admirable  succinctness a series of facts important to the knowledge of every  American:--    <blockquote>
 In the course of a year he was asked to report, and did report with   full details, upon the raising, management, and collection of the   revenue, including a scheme for revenue cutters; as to the   estimates of income and expenditure; as to the temporary regulation   of the chaotic currency; as to navigation laws, and the regulation   of the coasting trade, after a thorough consideration of a heap of   undigested statistics; as to the post-office, for which he drafted   a bill; as to the purchase of West Point; on the great question of   public lands and a uniform system of managing them; and upon all   claims against the government. Rapidly and effectively the   secretary dealt with all these matters, besides drawing up as a   voluntary suggestion a scheme for a judicial system. But in   addition to all this multiplicity of business there were other   matters like the temporary regulation of the currency, requiring   peremptory settlement. Money had to be found for the immediate and   pressing wants of the new government before any system had been or   could be adopted, and the only resources were the empty treasury   and broken credit of the old confederacy. By one ingenious   expedient or another, sometimes by pledging his own credit,   Hamilton got together what was absolutely needful, and without a   murmur conquered those petty troubles when he was elaborating and   devising a far-reaching policy. Then the whole financial machine of   the Treasury Department, and a system of accounting, demanded   instant attention. These intricate problems were solved at once,   the machine constructed, and the system of accounts devised and put   into operation; and so well were these difficult tasks performed   that they still subsist, developing and growing with the nation,   but at bottom the original arrangements of Hamilton. These   complicated questions, answered so rapidly and yet so accurately in   the first weeks of confusion incident to the establishment of a new   government, show a familiarity and preparation, as well as a   readiness of mind of a most unusual kind. Yet while Hamilton was   engaged in all this bewildering work, he was evolving the great   financial policy, at once broad, comprehensive, and minute, and   after the recess in January he laid his ground plan before Congress   in his first report on public credit; a state paper which marks an   era in American history, and by which the massive corner-stone,   from which the great structure of the Federal government has risen,   was securely laid.</blockquote>    
New York, meanwhile, had blossomed to her full. Houses had been  renovated, and with all the elegance to be commanded. Many had been let,  by the less ambitious, to the Members of Congress from other States, and  all were entertaining. General Schuyler occupied a house close to  Hamilton, and his daughters Cornelia and Peggy--Mrs. Stephen Van  Rensselaer--were lively members of society. The Vice-President had taken  the great house at Richmond Hill, and General Knox as imposing a mansion  as he could find. Washington, after a few months, moved to the McComb  house in lower Broadway, one of the largest in town, with a reception  room of superb proportions. Here Mrs. Washington, standing on a dais,  usually assisted by Mrs. Adams and Mrs. Hamilton, received, with the  rigid formality of foreign courts, all who dared to attend her levees.  She had discarded the simplicity of campaigning days, and attired  herself with a magnificence which was emulated by her "Court." It was  yet too soon to break from tradition, and the Washingtons conducted  themselves in accordance with their strong aristocratic proclivities.  Nor did it occur to anyone, even the most ardent Republican, that  dignity and splendour were inconsistent with a free and enlightened  Republic, until Jefferson began his steady and successful system of  plebeianizing the country.    
Washington's levees were frigid; but I have not observed any special  warmth at the White House upon public occasions in my own time. The  President, after the company had assembled, entered in full official  costume: black velvet and satin, diamond knee-buckles, his hair in a bag  and tied with ribbons. He carried a military hat under his arm, and wore  a dress sword in a green shagreen scabbard. He made a tour of the room,  addressing each guest in turn, all being ranged according to their rank.  At his wife's levees he attended as a private individual and mingled  more freely with the guests; but his presence always lowered every voice  in the room, and women trembled with anxiety lest he should not engage  them in conversation, while dreading that he might. The unparalleled  dignity, the icy reserve of his personality, had always affected the  temperature of the gatherings he honoured; but at this time, when to the  height of a colossal and unique reputation was added the first  incumbency of an office, bestowed by a unanimous sentiment, which was to  raise the United States to the plane of the great nations of Europe, he  was instinctively regarded as superhuman, rather as a human embodiment  of the Power beyond space. He was deeply sensitive to the depressing  effect he produced, and not a little bored by the open-mouthed curiosity  he excited. A youngster, having run after him for quite a block, one  day, panting from his exertions, Washington wheeled about suddenly, and  made a bow so profound and satirical that his pursuer fled with a yell  of terror.    
The President was very fond of the theatre, and invited a party once a  week to accompany him to John Street. He entertained at table  constantly, and dined out formally and intimately. Congress, he attended  in great state. He had brought to New York six white horses of the  finest Virginian breed, and a magnificent cream-coloured coach,  ornamented with cupids and festoons. For state occasions the horses were  covered over night with a white paste, and polished next morning until  they shone like silver. The hoofs were painted black. When Washington  drove through the city on his way to Congress, attended by postilions  and outriders, it is little wonder that he had a royal progress through  proud and satisfied throngs.    
The Adamses, who had counselled all the usages of foreign courts, but  had been outvoted by Hamilton and Jay, entertained but little less than  the President; and so did the Schuylers, Livingstons, Jays, and half the  town. The Hamiltons, of necessity, entertained far more simply; but  Betsey received every Wednesday evening, when her rooms were a crush of  fashion and politics, eager for a glimpse of Hamilton and to do court to  her popular self. They gave at least one dinner a week, but Betsey as a  rule went out with her parents, for her husband was too busy for  society.    
The world saw little of Hamilton at this time, and Betsey but little  more. He worked in his library or office for fourteen hours of the day,  while the country teemed with conjectures of his coming Report. A  disposition to speculate upon it was already manifest, and more than one  friend endeavoured to gain a hint of its contents. Not even Madison, to  whom he had talked more freely than to anyone, knew aught of the details  of that momentous Report, what recommendations he actually should make  to Congress; for none knew better than he that a hint derived from him  which should lead to profitable speculation would tarnish his good name  irretrievably. Careless in much else, on the subject of his private and  public integrity he was rigid; he would not have yielded a point to  retain the affection of the best and most valued of his friends.  Fastidious by nature on the question of his honour, he knew, also, that  other accusations, even when verified, mattered little in the long run;  a man's actual position in life and in history was determined by the  weight of his brain and the spotlessness of his public character. He  worked in secret, with no help from anyone; nor could blandishments  extract a hint of his purpose. Against the rock of his integrity passion  availed nothing. As for Betsey, between her growing children, the  delicacy which had followed the birth of her last child, and her heavy  social duties, she would have had little time to assist him had he  confided even in her. Moreover, to keep up a dignified position upon  $3500 a year cost her clever little Dutch head much anxious thought. It  is true that some money had been put aside from the income of her  husband's large practice, but he was the most careless and generous of  men, always refusing the fees of people poorer than himself, and with no  talent for personal, great as was his mastery of political, economy. If  General Schuyler often came to the rescue his son-in-law never knew it.  Hamilton had a vague idea that Betsey could manage somehow, and was far  too absorbed to give the matter a thought. Betsey, it would seem, had  her own little reputation, for it was about this time that M'Henry  finished a letter to Hamilton, as follows:--    <blockquote>
 Pray present me to Mrs. Hamilton. I have learned from a friend of   yours that she has, as far as the comparison will hold, as much   merit as your treasurer as you have as treasurer of the wealth of   the United States.</blockquote>
