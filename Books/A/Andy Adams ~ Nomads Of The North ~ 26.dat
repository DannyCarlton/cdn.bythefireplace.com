  For many days after the Great Fire it was Neewa who took the lead.   All their world was a black and lifeless desolation and Miki would   not have known which way to turn. Had it been a local fire of  small  extent he would have &quot;wandered&quot; out of its charred path. But  the  conflagration had been immense. It had swept over a vast reach  of  country, and for a half of the creatures who had saved  themselves in  the lakes and streams there was only a death by  starvation left. 
  But not for Neewa and his breed. Just as there had been no   indecision in the manner and direction of his flight before the  fire  so there was now no hesitation in the direction he chose to  seek a  live world again. It was due north and west&#8212;as straight as  a die. If  they came to a lake, and went around it, Neewa would  always follow the  shore until he came directly opposite his trail  on the other side of  the lake&#8212;and then strike north and west  again. He travelled steadily,  not only by day but also by night,  with only short intervals of rest,  and the dawning of the second  morning found Miki more exhausted than  the bear. 
  There were many evidences now that they had reached a point where   the fire had begun to burn itself out. Patches of green timber  were  left standing, there were swamps unscathed by the flames, and  here and  there they came upon green patches of meadow. In the  swamps and timber  they feasted, for these oases in what had been a  sea of flame were  filled with food ready to be preyed upon and  devoured. For the first  time Neewa refused to stop because there  was plenty to eat. The sixth  day they were a hundred miles from  the lake in which they had sought  refuge from the fire. 
  It was a wonderful country of green timber, of wide plains and of   many lakes and streams&#8212;cut up by a thousand usayow (low ridges),   which made the best of hunting. Because it was a country of many   waters, with live streams running between the ridges and from lake  to  lake, it had not suffered from the drought like the country  farther  south. For a month Neewa and Miki hunted in their new  paradise, and  became fat and happy again. 
  It was in September that they came upon a strange thing in the   edge of a swamp. At first Miki thought that it was a cabin; but it   was a great deal smaller than any cabin he had known. It was not  much  larger than the cage of saplings in which Le Beau had kept  him. But it  was made of heavy logs, and the logs were notched so  that nothing  could knock them down. And these logs, instead of  lying closely one on  the other, had open spaces six or eight  inches wide between them. And  there was a wide-open door. From  this strange contraption there came a  strong odour of over-ripened  fish. The smell repelled Miki. But it was  a powerful attraction to  Neewa, who persisted in remaining near it in  spite of all Miki  could do to drag him away. Finally, disgusted at his  comrade's bad  taste, Miki sulked off alone to hunt. It was some time  after that  before Neewa dared to thrust his head and shoulders through  the  opening. The smell of the fish made his little eyes gleam.   Cautiously he stepped inside the queer looking thing of logs.  Nothing  happened. He saw the fish, all he could eat, just on the  other side of  a sapling against which he must lean to reach them.  He went  deliberately to the sapling, leaned over, and then!&#8212; 
  &quot;CRASH!&quot; 
  He whirled about as if shot. There was no longer an opening where   he had entered. The sapling &quot;trigger&quot; had released an over-head  door,  and Neewa was a prisoner. He was not excited, but accepted  the  situation quite coolly, probably having no doubt in his mind  that  somewhere there was an aperture between the logs large enough  for him  to squeeze through. After a few inquisitive sniffs he  proceeded to  devour the fish. He was absorbed in his odoriferous  feast when out of  a clump of dwarf balsams a few yards away  appeared an Indian. He  quickly took in the situation, turned, and  disappeared. 
  Half an hour later this Indian ran into a clearing in which were   the recently constructed buildings of a new Post. He made for the   Company store. In the fur-carpeted &quot;office&quot; of this store a man  was  bending fondly over a woman. The Indian saw them as he  entered, and  chuckled. &quot;Sakehewawin&quot; (&quot;the love couple&quot;); that was  what they had  already come to call them at Post Lac Bain&#8212;this man  and woman who had  given them a great feast when the missioner had  married them not so  very long ago. The man and the woman stood up  when the Indian entered,  and the woman smiled at him. She was  beautiful. Her eyes were glowing,  and there was the flush of a  flower in her cheeks. The Indian felt the  worship of her warm in  his heart. 
  &quot;Oo-ee, we have caught the bear,&quot; he said. &quot;But it is napao (a he-   bear). There is no cub, Iskwao Nanette!&quot; 
  The white man chuckled. 
  &quot;Aren't we having the darndest luck getting you a cub for a house-   pet, Nanette?&quot; he asked. &quot;I'd have sworn this mother and her cub   would have been easily caught. A he-bear! We'll have to let him   loose, Mootag. His pelt is good for nothing. Do you want to go  with  us and see the fun, Nanette?&quot; 
  She nodded, her little laugh filled with the joy of love and life. 
  &quot;Oui. It will be such fun&#8212;to see him go!&quot; 
  Challoner led the way, with an axe in his hand; and with him came   Nanette, her hand in his. Mootag followed with his rifle, prepared   for an emergency. From the thick screen of balsams Challoner  peered  forth, then made a hole through which Nanette might look at  the cage  and its prisoner. For a moment or two she held her breath  as she  watched Neewa pacing back and forth, very much excited now.  Then she  gave a little cry, and Challoner felt her fingers pinch  his own  sharply. Before he knew what she was about to do she had  thrust  herself through the screen of balsams. 
  Close to the log prison, faithful to his comrade in the hour of   peril, lay Miki. He was exhausted from digging at the earth under  the  lower log, and he had not smelled or heard anything of the  presence of  others until he saw Nanette standing not twenty paces  away. His heart  leapt up into his panting throat. He swallowed, as  though to get rid  of a great lump; he stared. And then, with a  sudden, yearning whine,  he sprang toward her. With a yell  Challoner leapt out of the balsams  with uplifted axe. But before  the axe could fall, Miki was in  Nanette's arms, and Challoner  dropped his weapon with a gasp of  amazement&#8212;and one word: 
  &quot;MIKI!&quot; 
  Mootag, looking on in stupid astonishment, saw both the man and   the woman making a great fuss over a strange and wild-looking  beast  that looked as if it ought to be killed. They had forgotten  the bear.  And Miki, wildly joyous at finding his beloved master  and mistress,  had forgotten him also. It was a prodigious WHOOF  from Neewa himself  that brought their attention to him. Like a  flash Miki was back at the  pen smelling of Neewa's snout between  two of the logs, and with a  great wagging of tail trying to make  him understand what had happened. 
  Slowly, with a thought born in his head that made him oblivious of   all else but the big black brute in the pen, Challoner approached  the  trap. Was it possible that Miki could have made friends with  any other  bear than the cub of long ago? He drew in a deep breath  as he looked  at them. Neewa's brown-tipped nose was thrust between  two of the logs  and MIKI WAS LICKING IT WITH HIS TONGUE! He held  out a hand to  Nanette, and when she came to him he pointed for a  space, without  speaking. 
  Then he said: 
  &quot;It is the cub, Nanette. You know&#8212;the cub I have told you about.   They've stuck together all this time&#8212;ever since I killed the  cub's  mother a year and a half ago, and tied them together on a  piece of  rope. I understand now why Miki ran away from us when we  were at the  cabin. He went back&#8212;to the bear.&quot; 
  To-day if you strike northward from Le Pas and put your canoe in   the Rat River or Grassberry waterways, and thence paddle and run  with  the current down the Reindeer River and along the east shore  of  Reindeer Lake you will ultimately come to the Cochrane&#8212;and  Post Lac  Bain. It is one of the most wonderful countries in all  the northland.  Three hundred Indians, breeds and French, come with  their furs to Lac  Bain. Not a soul among them&#8212;man, woman, or  child&#8212;but knows the story  of the &quot;tame bear of Lac Bain&quot;&#8212;the pet  of l'ange, the white angel,  the Factor's wife. 
  The bear wears a shining collar and roams at will in the company   of a great dog, but, having grown huge and fat now, never wanders  far  from the Post. And it is an unwritten law in all that country  that the  animal must not be harmed, and that no bear traps shall  be set within  five miles of the Company buildings. Beyond that  limit the bear never  roams; and when it comes cold, and he goes  into his long sleep, he  crawls into a deep warm cavern that has  been dug for him under the  Company storehouse. And with him, when  the nights come, sleeps Miki  the dog.
