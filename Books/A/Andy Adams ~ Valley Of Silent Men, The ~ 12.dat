  That morning Kent had heard wild songs floating up from the river,   and now he felt like shouting forth his own joy and exultation in   song. He wondered if he could hide the truth from the eyes of  others,  and especially from Kedsty if he came to see him. It  seemed that some  glimmer of the hope blazing within him must  surely reveal itself, no  matter how he tried to hold it back. He  felt the vital forces of that  hope more powerful within him now  than in the hour when he had crept  from the hospital window with  freedom in his face. For then he was not  sure of himself. He had  not tested his physical strength. And in the  present moment,  fanned by his unbounded optimism, the thought came to  him that  perhaps it was good luck and not bad that had thrown Mercer  in his  way. For with Fingers behind him now, his chances for a clean  get-  away were better. He would not be taking a hazardous leap chanced   on the immediate smiles of fortune. He would be going  deliberately,  prepared. 
  He blessed the man who had been known as Dirty Fingers, but whom   he could not think of now in the terms of that name. He blessed  the  day he had heard that chance story of Fingers, far north. He  no longer  regarded him as the fat pig of a man he had been for so  many years.  For he looked upon the miracle of a great awakening.  He had seen the  soul of Fingers lift itself up out of its  tabernacle of flesh and grow  young again; he had seen stagnant  blood race with new fire. He had  seen emotions roused that had  slept for long years. And he felt toward  Fingers, in the face of  that awakening, differently than he had felt  toward any other  living man. His emotion was one of deep and embracing  comradeship. 
  Father Layonne did not come again until afternoon, and then he   brought information that thrilled Kent. The missioner had walked  down  to see Fingers, and Fingers was not on his porch. Neither was  the dog.  He had knocked loudly on the door, but there was no  answer. Where was  Fingers? Kent shook his head, feigning an  anxious questioning, but  inside him his heart was leaping. He  knew! He told Father Layonne he  was afraid all Fingers' knowledge  of the law could do him but little  good, that Fingers had told him  as much, and the little missioner went  away considerably  depressed. He would talk with Fingers again, he  said, and offer  certain suggestions he had in mind. Kent chuckled when  he was  gone. How shocked le Pere would be if he, too, could know! 
  The next morning Father Layonne came again, and his information   was even more thrilling to Kent. The missioner was displeased with   Fingers. Last night, noticing a light in his shack, he had walked   down to see him. And he had found three men closely drawn up about  a  table with Dirty Fingers. One of them was Ponte, the half-breed;   another was Kinoo the outcast Dog Rib from over on Sand Creek; the   third was Mooie, the old Indian trailer. Kent wanted to jump up  and  shout, for those three were the three greatest trailers in all  that  part of the Northland. Fingers had lost no time, and he  wanted to  voice his approbation like a small boy on the Fourth of  July. 
  But his face, seen by Father Layonne, betrayed none of the   excitement that was in his blood. Fingers had told him he was  going  into a timber deal with these men, a long-distance deal  where there  would be much traveling, and that he could not  interrupt himself just  then to talk about Kent. Would Father  Layonne come again in the  morning? And he had gone again that  morning, and Fingers' place was  locked up! 
  All the rest of the day Kent waited eagerly for Fingers. For the   first time Kedsty came to see him, and as a matter of courtesy  said  he hoped Fingers might be of assistance to him. He did not  mention  Mercer and remained no longer than a couple of minutes,  standing  outside the cell. In the afternoon Doctor Cardigan came  and shook  hands warmly with Kent. He had found a tough job waiting  for him, he  said. Mercer was all cut up, in a literal as well as a  mental way. He  had five teeth missing, and he had to have  seventeen stitches taken in  his face. It was Cardigan's opinion  that some one had given him a  considerable beating&#8212;and he grinned  at Kent. Then he added in a  whisper, 
  &quot;My God, Kent, how I wish you had made it!&quot; 
  It was four o'clock when Fingers came. Even less than yesterday   did he look like the old Fingers. He was not wheezing. He seemed  to  have lost flesh. His face was alive. That was what struck Kent  &#8212;the  new life in it. There was color in his eyes. And Togs, the  dog, was  not with him. He smiled when he shook hands with Kent,  and nodded, and  chuckled. And Kent, after that, gripped him by the  shoulders and shook  him in his silent joy. 
  &quot;I was up all last night,&quot; said Fingers in a low voice. &quot;I don't   dare move much in the day, or people will wonder. But, God bless  my  soul!&#8212;I did move last night, Kent. I must have walked ten  miles, more  or less. And things are coming&#8212;coming!&quot; 
  &quot;And Ponte, Kinoo, Mooie&#8212;?&quot; 
  &quot;Are working like devils,&quot; whispered Fingers. &quot;It's the only way,   Kent. I've gone through all my law, and there's nothing in man-  made  law that can save you. I've read your confession, and I don't  think  you could even get off with the penitentiary. A noose is  already tied  around your neck. I think you'd hang. We've simply  got to get you out  some other way. I've had a talk with Kedsty. He  has made arrangements  to have you sent to Edmonton two weeks from  tomorrow. We'll need all  that time, but it's enough.&quot; 
  For three days thereafter Fingers came to Kent's cell each   afternoon, and each time was looking better. Something was swiftly   putting hardness into his flesh and form into his body. The second   day he told Kent that he had found the way at last, and that when  the  hour came, escape would be easy, but he thought it best not to  let  Kent in on the little secret just yet. He must be patient and  have  faith. That was the chief thing, to have faith at all times,  no matter  what happened. Several times he emphasized that &quot;no  matter what  happens.&quot; The third day he puzzled Kent. He was  restless, a bit  nervous. He still thought it best not to tell Kent  what his scheme  was, until to-morrow. He was in the cell not more  than five or ten  minutes, and there was an unusual pressure in the  grip of his hand  when he bade Kent good-by. Somehow Kent did not  feel so well when he  had gone. He waited impatiently for the next  day. It came, and hour  after hour he listened for Fingers' heavy  tread in the hall. The  morning passed. The afternoon lengthened.  Night came, and Fingers had  not come. Kent did not sleep much  between the hour when he went to bed  and morning. It was eleven  o'clock when the missioner made his call.  Before he left, Kent  gave him a brief note for Fingers. He had just  finished his  dinner, and Carter had taken the dishes away, when Father  Layonne  returned. A look at his face, and Kent knew that he bore   unpleasant tidings. 
  &quot;Fingers is an&#8212;an apostate,&quot; he said, his lips twitching as if to   keep back a denunciation still more emphatic. &quot;He was sitting on  his  porch again this morning, half asleep, and says that after a  great  deal of thought he has come to the definite opinion that he  can do  nothing for you. He read your note and burned it with a  match. He  asked me to tell you that the scheme he had in mind was  too risky&#8212;for  him. He says he won't come up again. And&#8212;&quot; 
  The missioner was rubbing his brown, knotted hands together   raspingly. 
  &quot;Go on,&quot; said Kent a little thickly. 
  &quot;He has also sent Inspector Kedsty the same word,&quot; finished Father   Layonne. &quot;His word to Kedsty is that he can see no fighting chance   for you, and that it is useless effort on his part to put up a   defense for you. Jimmy!&quot; His hand touched Kent's arm gently. 
  Kent's face was white. He faced the window, and for a space he did   not see. Then with pencil and paper he wrote again to Fingers. 
  It was late in the afternoon before Father Layonne returned with   an answer. Again it was verbal. Fingers had read his note and had   burned it with a match. He was particular that the last scrap of  it  was turned into ash, the missioner said. And he had nothing to  say to  Kent that he had not previously said. He simply could not  go on with  their plans. And he requested Kent not to write to him  again. He was  sorry, but that was his definite stand in the  matter. 
  Even then Kent could not bring himself to believe. All the rest of   the day he tried to put himself in Fingers' brain, but his old  trick  of losing his personality in that of another failed him this  time. He  could find no reason for the sudden change in Fingers,  unless it was  what Fingers had frankly confessed to Father  Layonne&#8212;fear. The  influence of mind, in this instance, had failed  in its assault upon a  mass of matter. Fingers' nerve had gone back  on him. 
  The fifth day Kent rose from his cot with hope still not quite   dead in his heart. But that day passed and the sixth, and the   missioner brought word that Fingers was the old Dirty Fingers  again,  sitting from morning till night on his porch. 
  On the seventh day came the final crash to Kent's hopes. Kedsty's   program had changed. He, Kent, was to start for Edmonton the   following morning under charge of Pelly and a special constable! 
  After this Kent felt a strange change come over him. Years seemed   to multiply themselves in his body. His mind, beaten back, no  longer  continued in its old channels of thought. The thing pressed  upon him  now as fatalistic. Fingers had failed him. Fortune had  failed him.  Everything had failed, and for the first time in the  weeks of his  struggle against death and a thing worse than death,  he cursed  himself. There was a limit to optimism and a limit to  hope. His limit  was reached. 
  In the afternoon of this seventh day came a depressing gloom. It   was filled with a drizzling rain. Hour after hour this drizzle  kept  up, thickening as the night came. He ate his supper by the  light of a  cell lamp. By eight o'clock it was black outside. In  that blackness  there was an occasional flash of lightning and  rumble of thunder. On  the roof of the barracks the rain beat  steadily and monotonously. 
  His watch was in his hand&#8212;it was a quarter after nine o'clock,   when he heard the door at the far exit of the hall open and close.  He  had heard it a dozen times since supper and paid no attention  to it,  but this time it was followed by a voice at the detachment  office that  hit him like an electrical shock. Then, a moment  later, came low  laughter. It was a woman who laughed. 
  He stood up. He heard the detachment office door close, and   silence followed. The watch in his hand seemed ticking off the   seconds with frantic noise. He shoved it into his pocket and stood   staring out into the prison alcove. A few minutes later the office   door opened again. This time it was not closed. He heard  distinctly a  few light, hesitating footsteps, and his heart seemed  to stop its  beating. They came to the head of the lighted alcove,  and for perhaps  the space of a dozen seconds there was silence  again. Then they  advanced. 
  Another moment, and Kent was staring through the bars into the   glorious eyes of Marette Radisson!
