  Harry did not awaken until late the next morning.  Jackson, for  once,  allowed his soldiers a long rest, and they were entitled to it.   When he  rose from his blankets, he found fires burning, and the  pleasant odor of  coffee, bacon and other food came to his nostrils.   Many wounded were  stretched on blankets, but, as usual, they were  stoics, and made no  complaint. 
  The army, in truth, was joyous, even more, it was exultant.  Every  one  had the feeling that he had shared in mighty triumphs,  unparalleled  exploits, but they gave the chief credit to their leader,  and they spoke  admiringly and affectionately of Old Jack.  The whole  day was passed in  luxury long unknown to them.  They had an abundance  of food, mostly  captured, and their rations were not limited. 
  The Acadian band reappeared and played with as much spirit as ever,   and once more the dark, strong men of Louisiana, clasped in one  another's  arms, danced on the grass.  Harry sat with St. Clair, Happy  Tom and  Dalton and watched them. 
  &#8220;I was taught that dancing was wicked,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;but it  doesn't look  wicked to me, and I notice that the general doesn't  forbid it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Wicked!&#8221; said St. Clair, &#8220;why, after we take Washington, you ought  to  come down to Charleston and see us dance then.  It's good instead  of  wicked.  It's more than that.  It's a thing of beauty, a grace, a  joy,  almost a rite.&#8221; 
  &#8220;All that Arthur says is true,&#8221; said Happy Tom.  &#8220;I'm a Sea  Islander  myself, but we go over to Charleston in the winter.  Still, I  think  you'll have to do without me at those dances, Arthur.  I shall  probably  be kept for some time in the North, acting as proconsul for  Pennsylvania  or Massachusetts.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Which way do you think we are going from here, Harry?&#8221; asked St.  Clair.  &#8220;I don't think it's possible for General Jackson to stay longer  than  twenty-four hours in one place, and I know that he always goes to  you for  instructions before he makes any movement.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's so.  He spoke to me this morning asking what he ought to  do,  but I told him the troops needed a rest of one day, but that he  mustn't  make it more than one day or he'd spoil 'em.&#8221; 
  Happy Tom, who was lying on the ground, sat up abruptly. 
  &#8220;If ever you hear of Old Stonewall spoiling anybody or anything,&#8221;  he said,  &#8220;just you report it to me and I'll tell you that it's not  so.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I believe,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;that we're going to leave the valley.   Both  Shields and Fremont are still retreating.  Our cavalry scouts  brought in  that word this morning.  We've heard also that Johnston and  McClellan  fought a big battle at a place called Seven Pines, and that  after it  McClellan hung back, waiting for McDowell, whom Old Jack has  kept busy.  General Johnston was wounded at Seven Pines and General  Robert Edward Lee  is now in command of our main army.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That's news!  It's more!  It's history!&#8221; exclaimed St. Clair.  &#8220;I  think  you're right, Harry.  Two to one that we go to Richmond.  And  for one  I'll be glad.  Then we'll be right in the middle of the  biggest doings!&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm feeling that way, too,&#8221; said Happy Tom.  &#8220;But I know one  thing.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What's that?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Not a soul in all this army, except Old Jack himself, will know a  thing  about it, until it's done, and maybe we won't know very much  then.  I passed Old Jack about an hour ago and he saw me as clearly and  plainly  as I see you, but he did not tell me a thing about his plans.   He did not  even say a word.  Did not speak.  Just cut me dead.&#8221; 
  Not one of the four was destined for some days to learn what  Jackson  intended.  His highest officers even were kept in the same  ignorance.  While the bulk of the army did little, the cavalry under  Munford, who had  succeeded Ashby, were exceedingly active.  The  horsemen were like a swarm  of hornets in front of Jackson, and so  great was their activity that the  Northern leaders were unable to  gauge their numbers.  Fremont, exposed to  these raids, retreated  farther down the valley, leaving two hundred of  his wounded and many  stores in the hands of Munford. 
  Then Jackson crossed South River and marched into extensive woods  by the  Shenandoah, where his army lay for five full days.  It was  almost  incredible to Harry and his friends that they should have so  long a rest,  but they had it.  They luxuriated there among the trees  in the beautiful  June weather, listening to the music of the Acadians,  eating and drinking  and sleeping as men have seldom slept before. 
  But while the infantry was resting the activity of the cavalry  never  ceased.  These men, riding over the country in which most of  them were  born, missed no movement of the enemy, and maintained the  illusion that  their numbers were four or five times the fact.  Harry,  trying to fathom  Jackson's purpose, gave it up after that  comparatively long stay beside  the Shenandoah.  He did not know that  it was a part of a complicated plan,  that Lee and Jackson, although  yet apart, were now beginning their  celebrated work together.  Near  Richmond, Northern prisoners saw long  lines of trains moving north and  apparently crowded with soldiers.  For Jackson, of course!  And  intended to help him in his great march on  Washington!  But Jackson  hung a complete veil about his own movements.  His highest officers  told one another in confidence things that they  believed to be true,  but which were not.  It was the general opinion  among them that  Jackson would soon leave in pursuit of Fremont. 
  The pleasant camp by the Shenandoah was broken up suddenly, and the  men  began to march&#8212;they knew not where.  Officers rode among them  with stern  orders, carried out sternly.  In front, and on either  flank, rode lines  of cavalry who allowed not a soul to pass either in  or out.  An equally  strong line of cavalry in the rear drove in front  of it every straggler  or camp follower.  There was not a single person  inside the whole army of  Jackson who could get outside it except  Jackson himself. 
  An extraordinary ban of ignorance was also placed upon them, and it  was  enforced to the letter.  No soldier should give the name of a  village or  a farm through which he passed, although the farm might be  his father's,  or the village might be the one in which he was born.   If a man were  asked a question, no matter what, he must answer, &#8220;I  don't know.&#8221; 
  The young Southern soldiers, indignant at first, enjoyed it as  their  natural humor rose to the surface. 
  &#8220;Young fellow,&#8221; said Happy Tom to St. Clair, &#8220;what's your name?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't know your own name.  Why, you must be feeble minded!  Are  you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, you may not know, but you look it.  Do you think Old Jack is  a  good general?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you think he's feeble-minded like yourself?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What!  You dare to intimate that Stonewall Jackson, the greatest  general  the world has ever known, is feeble-minded!  You have insulted  him,  and in his name I challenge you to fight me, sir.  Do you  accept?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221; 
  The two looked at each other and grinned.  The ignorance of the  army grew  dense beyond all computation.  Long afterward, &#8220;I don't  know,&#8221; became a  favorite and convenient reply, even when the knowledge  was present. 
  It was nearly two weeks after Port Republic before the troops had  any  idea where they were going.  They came to a little place called  Hanover  Junction and they thought they were going to turn there and  meet McDowell,  but they passed on, and one evening they encamped in a  wood.  As they  were eating supper they heard the muttering thunder of  guns toward the  south, and throughout the brigades the conviction  spread that they were  on the way to Richmond. 
  The next night, Harry, who was asleep, was touched by a light hand.   He awoke instantly, and when he saw General Jackson standing over him,   he sprang up. 
  &#8220;I am going on a long ride,&#8221; said the general briefly, &#8220;and I want  only  one man to go with me.  I've chosen you.  Get your horse.  We  start in  five minutes.&#8221; 
  Harry, a little dazed yet from sleep and the great honor that had  been  thrust upon him, ran, nevertheless, for his horse, and was ready  with a  minute to spare. 
  &#8220;Keep by my side,&#8221; said Jackson curtly, and the two rode in silence  from  the camp, watched in wonder by the sentinels, who saw their  general and  his lone attendant disappear in the forest to the south. 
  It was then one o'clock in the morning of a moonlight night, and  the  errand of Jackson was an absolute secret.  Three or four miles  from the  camp a sentinel slipped from the woods and stopped them.  He  was one of  their own pickets, on a far out-lying post, but to the  amazement of Harry,  Jackson did not tell who he was. 
  &#8220;I'm an officer on Stonewall Jackson's staff, carrying dispatches,&#8221;   he said.  &#8220;You must let me pass.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's not enough.  Show me an order from him.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have no order,&#8221; replied the equable voice, &#8220;but my dispatches  are of  the greatest importance.  Kindly let me pass immediately.&#8221; 
  The sentinel shook his head. 
  &#8220;Draw back your horses,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Without an order from the  general you  don't go a step further.&#8221; 
  Harry had not spoken a word.  He had ceased to wonder why Jackson  refused  to reveal his identity.  If he did not do so it must be for  some  excellent reason, and, meanwhile, the boy waited placidly. 
  &#8220;So you won't let us pass,&#8221; said Jackson.  &#8220;Is the commander of the   picket near by?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I can whistle so he'll hear me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then will you kindly whistle?&#8221; 
  The sentinel looked again at the quiet man on the horse, put his  fingers  to his lips and blew loudly.  An officer emerged from the  woods and said: 
  &#8220;What is it, Felton?&#8221; 
  Then he glanced at the man on the horse and started violently. 
  &#8220;General Jackson!&#8221; he exclaimed. 
  The sentinel turned pale, but said nothing. 
  &#8220;Yes, I'm General Jackson,&#8221; said the general, &#8220;and I ride with this   lieutenant of my staff on an errand.  But both of you must swear to me   that you have not seen me.&#8221; 
  Then he turned to the sentinel. 
  &#8220;You did right to stop us,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I wish that all our  sentinels were  as faithful as you.&#8221; 
  Then while the man glowed with gratitude, he and Harry rode on.   Jackson  was in deep thought and did not speak.  Harry, a little awed  by this  strange ride, looked up at the trees and the dusky heavens.   He heard the  far hoot of an owl, and he shivered a little.  What if a  troop of  Northern cavalry should suddenly burst upon them.  But no  troop of the  Northern horse, nor horse of any kind, appeared.   Instead, Jackson's own  horse began to pant and stumble.  Soon he gave  out entirely. 
  It was not yet day, but dimly to the right they saw the roof of a  house  among some trees.  It was a poor Virginia farm that did not have  horses  on it, and Jackson suggested to Harry that they wake up the  people and  secure two fresh mounts. 
  The commander of an army and his young aide walked a little  distance down  a road, entered a lawn, drove off two barking dogs, and  knocked loud on  the front door of the house with the butts of their  riding whips.  A head was at last thrust out of an upper window, and a  sleepy and  indignant voice demanded what they wanted. 
  &#8220;We're two officers from General Jackson's army riding on important  duty,&#8221;  replied the general, in his usual mild tones.  &#8220;Our horses have  broken  down and we want to obtain new ones.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What's your names?  What's your rank?&#8221; demanded the gruff voice. 
  &#8220;We cannot give our names.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then clear out!  You're frauds!  If I find you hanging about here  I'll  shoot at you, and I tell you for your good that I'm no bad shot.&#8221; 
  The shutter of the window closed with a bang, but the two dogs that  had  been driven off began to bark again at a safe distance.  Harry  glanced at  his general. 
  &#8220;Isn't that a stable among the trees?&#8221; asked Jackson. 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then we'll find our horses there.  Get the other two and bring  them  here.&#8221; 
  Harry obeyed promptly, and they opened the stable, finding good  horses,  of which they selected the two best to which they changed  their saddles  and bridles. 
  &#8220;We'll leave our own horses for our inhospitable friends,&#8221; said  General  Jackson, &#8220;and he'll not suffer by the exchange.&#8221; 
  Mounting the fresh horses they rode rapidly, and, after the coming  of the  dawn, Harry saw that they were approaching Richmond, and he  guessed now  what was coming. 
  General Jackson had in his pocket a pass sent to him by General  Lee,  and they swiftly went through the lines of pickets, and then on  through  Richmond.  People were astir in the streets of the Southern  capital,  and many of them saw the bearded man in an old uniform and a  black slouch  hat riding by, accompanied by only a boy, but not one of  them knew that  this was Stonewall Jackson, whose fame had been filling  their ears for a  month past.  Nor, if they had known him would they  have divined how much  ill his passage boded to the great army of  McClellan. 
  They went through Richmond and on toward the front.  Midday passed,   and at three o'clock they reached the house in which Lee had  established  his headquarters. 
  &#8220;Who is it?&#8221; asked a sentinel at the door. 
  &#8220;Tell General Lee that General Jackson is waiting.&#8221; 
  The sentinel hurried inside, General Jackson and his aide  dismounted,  and a moment later General Lee came out, extending his  hand, which  Jackson clasped.  The two stood a moment looking at each  other.  It was  the first time that they had met in the war, but Harry  saw by the glance  that passed that each knew the other a man, not an  ordinary man, nor even  a man of ten thousand, but a genius of the kind  that appears but seldom.  It was all the more extraordinary that the  two should appear at the same  time, serving together in perfect  harmony, and sustaining for so long by  their united power and  intellect a cause that seemed lost from the first. 
  It was not any wonder that Harry gazed with all his eyes at the  memorable  meeting.  He knew Jackson, and he was already learning much  of Lee. 
  He saw in the Confederate commander-in-chief a man past fifty,  ruddy of  countenance, hair and beard short, gray and thick, his figure  tall and  powerful, and his expression at once penetrating and kind.   He was  dressed in a fine gray uniform, precise and neat. 
  Such was Robert Edward Lee, and Harry thought him the most  impressive  human being upon whom he had ever looked. 
  &#8220;General Jackson,&#8221; said General Lee, &#8220;this is a fortunate meeting.   You have saved the Confederacy.&#8221; 
  General Jackson made a gesture of dissent, but General Lee took him  by  the arm and they went into the house.  General Jackson turned a  moment at  the door and motioned to Harry to follow.  The boy went in,  and found  himself in a large room.  Three men had risen from cane  chairs to meet  the visitor.  One, broad of shoulders, middle-aged and  sturdy, was  Longstreet.  The others more slender of figure were the  two Hills. 
  The major generals came forward eagerly to meet Jackson, and they  also  had friendly greetings for his young aide.  Lee handed them  glasses of  milk which they drank thirstily. 
  &#8220;You'll find an aide of mine in the next room,&#8221; said General Lee to   Harry.  &#8220;He's a little older than you are but you should get along   together.&#8221; 
  Harry bowed and withdrew, and the aide, Charlie Gordon, gave him a  hearty  welcome.  He was three or four years Harry's senior, something  of a  scholar, but frank and open.  When they had exchanged names,  Gordon said: 
  &#8220;Stretch out a bit on this old sofa.  You look tired.  You've been  riding  a long distance.  How many miles have you come?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know,&#8221; replied Harry, as he lay luxuriously on the sofa,  &#8220;but we  started at one o'clock this morning and it is now three  o'clock in the  afternoon.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Fourteen hours.  It's like what we've been hearing of Stonewall  Jackson.  I took a peep at him from the window as you rode up.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I suppose you didn't see much but dust.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They certainly tell extraordinary things of General Jackson.  It  can't  be possible that all are true!&#8221; 
  &#8220;It is possible.  They're all true&#8212;and more.  I tell you, Gordon,   when you hear anything wonderful about Stonewall Jackson just you  believe  it.  Don't ask any questions, or reasons but believe it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I think I shall,&#8221; said Gordon, convinced, &#8220;but don't forget,  Kenton,  that we've got a mighty man here, too.  You can't be with  General Lee  long without feeling that you're in the presence of  genius.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And they're friends, not jealous of each other.  You could see  that at a  glance.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The coming of Jackson is like dawn bursting from the dark.  I  feel,  Kenton, that McClellan's time is at hand.&#8221; 
  Harry slept a little after a while, but when he awoke the generals  were  still in council in the great room. 
  &#8220;I let you sleep because I saw you needed it,&#8221; said Gordon with a  smile,  &#8220;but I think they're about through in there now.  I hear them  moving  about.&#8221; 
  General Jackson presently called Harry and they rode away.  The  young  aide was sent back to the valley army with a message for it to  advance as  fast as possible in order that it might be hurled on  McClellan's flank.  Others carried the same message, lest there be any  default of chance. 
  While the army of Jackson swept down by Richmond to join Lee it was  lost  again to the North.  At Washington they still believed it in the  valley,  advancing on Fremont or Shields.  Banks and McDowell had the  same belief.  McClellan was also at a loss.  Two or three scouts had  brought in reports  that it was marching toward Richmond, but he could  not believe them. 
  The Secretary of War at Washington telegraphed to McClellan that  the  Union armies under McDowell, Banks, Fremont and Shields were to be   consolidated in one great army under McDowell which would crush  Jackson  utterly in the valley.  At the very moment McClellan was  reading this  telegram the army of Jackson, far to the south of  McDowell, was driving  in the pickets on his own flank. 
  Jackson's men had come into a region quite different from the  valley.  There they marched and fought over firm ground, and crossed  rivers with  hard rocky banks.  Now they were in a land of many deep  rivers that  flowed in a slow yellow flood with vast swamps between.   Most of it was  heavy with forest and bushes, and the heat was great.   At night vast  quantities of mosquitoes and flies and other insects  fed bounteously upon  them. 
  The Invincibles lifted up their voices and wept. 
  &#8220;Can't you persuade Old Jack to take us back to the valley, Harry?&#8221;   said Happy Tom.  &#8220;If I'm to die I'd rather be shot by an honest Yankee   soldier than be stung to death by these clouds of bloodsuckers.  Oh,   for our happy valley, where we shot at our enemy and he shot at us,   both standing on firm ground!&#8221; 
  &#8220;You won't be thinking much about mosquitoes and rivers soon,&#8221; said   Harry.  &#8220;Listen to that, will you!  You know the sound, don't you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Know it!  Well, I ought to know it.  It's the booming of cannon,  but it  doesn't frighten these mosquitoes and flies a particle.  A  cannon ball  whistling by my head would scare me half to death, but it  wouldn't  disturb them a bit.  They'd look with an evil eye at that  cannon ball as  it flew by and say to it in threatening tones: 'What  are you doing here?  Let this fellow alone.  He belongs to us.'&#8221; 
  &#8220;Which way is McClellan coming, Harry?&#8221; asked St. Clair. 
  &#8220;Off there to the east, where you hear the guns.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How many men has he?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Anywhere from a hundred thousand to a hundred and thirty thousand.   There are various reports.&#8221; 
  Langdon, who had been listening, whistled. 
  &#8220;It doesn't look like a picnic for the Invincibles,&#8221; he said.   &#8220;When I  volunteered for this war I didn't volunteer to fight a  pitched battle  every day.  What did you volunteer for, Harry?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221; 
  The three laughed.  Jackson's famous order certainly fitted well  there. 
  &#8220;And you don't know, either,&#8221; said Happy Tom, &#8220;what all that  thunder off  there to the south and east means.  It's the big guns, but  who are  fighting and where?&#8221; 
  &#8220;There's to be a general attack on McClellan along the line of the   Chickahominy river,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and our army is to be a part of the   attacking force, but my knowledge goes no further.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then I'm reckoning that some part of our army has attacked  already,&#8221;  said Happy Tom.  &#8220;Maybe they're ahead of time, or maybe the  rest are  behind time.  But there they go!  My eyes, how they're  whooping it up!&#8221; 
  The cannonade was growing in intensity and volume.  Despite the  sunset  they saw an almost continuous flare of red on the horizon.  The  three  boys felt some awe as they sat there and listened and looked.   Well they  might!  Battle on a far greater scale than anything  witnessed before in  America had begun already.  Two hundred thousand  men were about to meet  in desperate conflict in the thickets and  swamps along the Chickahominy. 
  Richmond had already heard the crash of McClellan's guns more than  once,  but apprehension was passing away.  Lee, whom they had learned  so quickly  to trust, stood with ninety thousand men between them and  McClellan,  and with him was the redoubtable Jackson and his veterans  of the valley  with their caps full of victories. 
  McClellan had the larger force, but Lee was on the defensive in his  own  country, a region which offered great difficulties to the invader. 
  Harry and his comrades wondered why Jackson did not move, but he  remained  in his place, and when Harry fell asleep he still heard the  thudding of  the guns across the vast reach of rivers and creeks,  swamps and thickets.  When he awoke in the morning they were already at  work again, flaring at  intervals down there on the eastern horizon.   The whole wet, swampy  country, so different from his own, seemed to  be deserted by everything  save the armies.  No rabbits sprang up in  the thickets and there were no  birds.  Everything had fled already in  the presence of war. 
  But the army marched.  After a brief breakfast the brigades moved  down  the road, and Harry saw clearly that these veterans of the valley  were  tremulous with excitement.  Youthful, eager, and used to victory,  they  were anxious to be at the very center of affairs which were now  on a  gigantic scale.  And the throbbing of the distant guns steadily  drew them  on. 
  &#8220;We'll get all we want before this is through,&#8221; said Dalton gravely  to  Harry. 
  &#8220;I think so, too.  Listen to those big guns, George!  And I think I  can  hear the crack of rifles, too.  Our pickets and those of the enemy  must  be in contact in the forest there on our left.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I haven't a doubt of it, but if we rode that way like as not we'd  strike  first a swamp, or a creek twenty feet deep.  I get all tangled  up in this  kind of a country.&#8221; 
  &#8220;So do I, but it doesn't make any difference.  We just stick along  with  Old Jack.&#8221; 
  The army marched on a long time, always to the accompaniment of  that  sinister mutter in the southeast.  Then they heard the note of a  bugle in  front of them and Jackson with his staff rode forward near a  little  church called Walnut Grove, where Lee and his staff sat on  their horses  waiting.  Harry noticed with pride how all the members of  Lee's staff  crowded forward to see the renowned Jackson. 
  It was his general upon whom so many were looking, but there was   curiosity among Stonewall's men, too, about Lee.  As Harry drew back a   little while the two generals talked, he found himself again with the   officers of the Invincibles. 
  &#8220;He has grown gray since we were with him in Mexico, Hector,&#8221; he  heard  Colonel Leonidas Talbot say to Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St.  Hilaire. 
  &#8220;Yes, Leonidas, grayer but stronger.  What a brow and eye!&#8221; 
  St. Clair and Langdon, who had never seen Lee before, were eager. 
  &#8220;Is he the right man for Old Jack to follow, Harry?&#8221; asked Happy  Tom. 
  &#8220;I don't think there's any doubt of it, Happy.  I saw how they  agreed the  first time they met, and you can see it now.  You'll find  them working  together as smooth as silk.  Ah, here we go again!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then if it's as you say I suppose it's all up with McClellan, and  I  needn't trouble my mind about the matter any more.  Hereafter I'll  just  go ahead and obey orders.&#8221; 
  The words were light, but there was no frivolity in the minds of  the  three.  Despite the many battles through which they had already  gone  their hearts were beating hard just then, while that roaring was  going on  on the horizon, and they knew that a great battle was at  hand. 
  Lee and his staff rode toward the battle, and then, to the  amazement of  his men, Jackson led his army into the deep woods away  from the sound of  the thundering guns which had been calling to them  so incessantly.  Harry was mystified and the general vouchsafed no  word, even to his own  staff.  They marched on through woods, across  fields, along the edges of  swamps, and that crash of battle grew  fainter behind them, but never died  out. 
  &#8220;What do you think it means?&#8221; Harry whispered to Dalton. 
  &#8220;Don't know.  I'm not thinking.  I'm not here to think at such  times.  All the thinking we need is going on under the old slouch hat  there.  Harry, didn't we go with him all through the valley?  Can't we  still  trust him?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I can and will.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Same here.&#8221; 
  The army curved about again.  Harry, wholly unfamiliar with the  country,  did not notice it until the roar of the battle began to rise  again,  showing that they were coming nearer.  Then he divined the  plan.  Jackson  was making this circuit through the woods to fall on  the Northern flank.  It was the first of the great turning movements  which Lee and Jackson  were to carry through to brilliant success so  often. 
  &#8220;Look at the red blaze beyond those bushes,&#8221; said Dalton, &#8220;and  listen how  rapidly the sound of the battle is growing in volume.  I  don't know where  we are, but I do know now that Old Jack is leading us  right into the  thick of it.&#8221; 
  The general rode forward and stopped his horse on the crest of a  low  hill.  Then Harry and Dalton, looking over the bushes and swamps,  saw a  great blue army stationed behind a creek and some low works. 
  &#8220;It's McClellan!&#8221; exclaimed Dalton. 
  &#8220;Or a part of him,&#8221; said Harry. 
  It was a wing of the Northern army.  McClellan himself was not  there,  but many brave generals were, Porter, Slocum and the others.   The  batteries of this army were engaged in a heavy duel with the  Southern  batteries in front, and the sharpshooters in the woods and  bushes kept up  a continuous combat that crackled like the flames of a  forest fire. 
  Harry drew a long breath. 
  &#8220;This is the biggest yet,&#8221; he said. 
  Dalton nodded. 
  The soldiers of Jackson were already marching off through the  woods,  floundering through deep mud, crossing little streams swollen  by heavy  rains, but eager to get into action. 
  It was very difficult for the mounted men, and Harry and Dalton at  last  dismounted and led their horses.  The division made slow progress  and as  they struggled on the battle deepened.  Now and then as they  toiled  through the muck they saw long masses of blue infantry on a  ridge,  and with them the batteries of great guns which the gunners of  the North  knew so well how to use. 
  Their own proximity was discovered after a while, and shell and  bullets  began to fly among them, but they emerged at last on firm  ground and on  the Northern flank. 
  &#8220;It's hot and growing hotter,&#8221; said Dalton. 
  &#8220;And we'll help increase the heat if we ever get through these  morasses,&#8221;  said Harry. 
  He felt the bridle suddenly pulled out of his hand, and turned to  catch  his runaway horse, but the horse had been shot dead and his body  had  fallen into the swamp.  Dalton's horse also was killed presently  by a  piece of shell, but the two plunged along on foot, endeavoring to  keep up  with the general. 
  The fire upon them was increasing fast.  Some of the great guns on  the  ridge were now searching their ranks with shell and shrapnel and  many a  man sank down in the morass, to be lost there forever.  But  Jackson never  ceased to urge them on.  They were bringing their  batteries that way, too,  and men and horses alike tugged at the  cannon. 
  &#8220;If we ever get through,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;we're bound to do big  things.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We'll get through, never fear,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;Isn't Old Jack  driving  us?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Here we are!&#8221; Harry shouted suddenly as his feet felt firm ground. 
  &#8220;And here's the whole division, too!&#8221; exclaimed Dalton. 
  The regiments and brigades of Jackson emerged from the forest, and  with  them came six batteries of cannon which they had almost carried  over the  swamp.  The whole battlefield now came into sight, but the  firing and the  smoke were so great that it seemed to change  continuously in color and  even in shape.  At one moment there was a  ridge where none had been  before, then where Harry had seen a creek  there was only dry land.  But he knew that they were illusions of the  eyes, due to the excited  brain behind them. 
  Harry saw the six batteries of Jackson planted in a long row on the  hard  ground, and then open with a terrific crash on the defenders of  the  ridge.  The sound was so tremendous that he was deafened for a few   moments.  By the time his hearing was restored fully the batteries  fired  again and the Northern batteries on the hill replied.  Then the  mass of  infantry charged and Harry and Dalton on foot, waving their  swords and  wild with excitement, charged with them. 
  The plans of Lee and Jackson, working together for the first time  in a  great battle, went through.  When Lee heard the roar of Jackson's  guns on  the flank he, too, sent word to his division commanders to  charge with  their full strength.  In an instant the Northern army was  assailed both  in front and on the side, by a great force, rushing  forward, sure of  victory and sending the triumphant rebel yell echoing  through the woods  of the Chickahominy. 
  Harry felt the earth tremble beneath him as nearly a hundred  thousand men  closed in deadly conflict.  He could hear nothing but the  continued roar,  and he saw only a vast, blurred mass of men and guns.   But he was  conscious that they were going forward, up the hill,  straight toward the  enemy's works, and he felt sure of victory. 
  He had grounds for his faith.  Lee with the smaller army, had   nevertheless brought superior numbers upon the field at the point of   action.  Porter and Slocum were staunch defenders.  The Northern army,   though shattered by cannon and rifle fire, stood fast on the ridge  until  the charging lines were within ten feet of them.  Then they gave  way,  but carried with them most of their cannon, reformed further  back,  and fought again. 
  Harry found himself shouting triumphantly over one of the captured  guns,  but the Southern troops were allowed no time to exult.  The sun  was  already sinking over the swamps and the battlefield, but Lee and  Jackson  lifted up their legions and hurled them anew to the attack.   McClellan  was not there when he was needed most, but Porter did all  that a man  could do.  Only two of his eighty guns had been taken, and  he might yet  have made a stand, but the last of Jackson's force  suddenly emerged from  the forest and again he was struck with terrible  impact on the flank. 
  The Northern army gave way again.  The Southern brigades rushed  forward  in pursuit, capturing many prisoners, and giving impulse to  the flight of  their enemies.  Their riflemen shot down the horses  drawing the  retreating cannon.  Many of the guns were lost, twenty-two  of them  falling into Southern hands.  Some of the newer regiments  melted entirely  away under an attack of such fierceness.  Nothing  stopped the advance of  Lee and Jackson but the night, and the arrival  of a heavy reinforcement  sent by McClellan.  The new force, six  thousand strong, was stationed in  a wood, the guns that had escaped  were turned upon the enemy, Porter and  Slocum rallied their yet  numerous force, and when the dark came down the  battle ceased with the  Northern army in the east defeated again, but not  destroyed. 
  As Harry rode over the scene of battle that night he shuddered.   The  fields, the forests and the swamps were filled with the dead and  the  wounded.  Save Shiloh, no other such sanguinary battle had yet  been  fought on American soil.  Nearly ten thousand of the Southern  youths had  fallen, killed or wounded.  The North, standing on the  defensive, had not  lost so many, but the ghastly roll ran into many  thousands. 
  That night, as had happened often in the valley, the hostile  sentinels  were within hearing of each other, but they fired no shots.   Meanwhile,  Lee and Jackson, after the victory, which was called  Gaines' Mill,  planned to strike anew. 
  Harry awoke in the morning to find that most of the Northern army  was  gone.  The brigades had crossed the river in the night, breaking  down the  bridges behind them.  He saw the officers watching great  columns of dust  moving away, and he knew that they marked the line of  the Northern march.  But the Southern scouts and skirmishers found many  stragglers in the  woods, most of them asleep or overpowered by  weariness.  Thus they found  the brilliant General Reynolds, destined  to a glorious death afterward at  Gettysburg, sound asleep in the  bushes, having been lost from his command  in the darkness and  confusion.  The Southern army rested through the  morning, but in the  afternoon was on the march again.  Harry found that  both St. Clair and  Langdon had escaped without harm this time, but Happy  Tom had lost  some of his happiness. 
  &#8220;This man Lee is worse than Jackson,&#8221; he lamented.  &#8220;We've just  fought  the biggest battle that ever was, and now we're marching  hot-foot after  another.&#8221; 
  Happy Tom was right.  Lee and Jackson had resolved to give  McClellan no  rest.  They were following him closely and Stuart with  the cavalry hung  in a cloud on his flanks.  They pressed him hard the  next day at White  Oak Swamp, Jackson again making the circular  movement and falling on his  flank, while Longstreet attacked in front.   There was a terrible battle  in thick forest and among deep ravines,  but the darkness again saved the  Northern army, which escaped, leaving  cannon and men in the hands of the  enemy. 
  Harry lay that night in a daze rather than sleep.  He was feverish  and  exhausted, yet he gathered some strength from the stupor in which  he lay.  All that day they marched along the edge of a vast swamp, and  they heard  continually the roar of a great battle on the horizon,  which they were  not able to reach.  It was Glendale, where Longstreet  and one of the  Hills fought a sanguinary draw with McClellan.  But the  Northern  commander, knowing that a drawn battle in the enemy's country  was  equivalent to a defeat, continued his retreat and the Southern  army  followed, attacking at every step.  The roar of artillery  resounded  continuously through the woods and the vanguard of one army  and the rear  guard of the other never ceased their rifle fire. 
  Neither Harry nor his young comrades could ever get a clear picture  of  the vast, confused battle amid the marshes of the Chickahominy,  extending  over so long a period and known as the Seven Days, but it  was obvious to  them now that Richmond was no longer in danger.  The  coming of Jackson  had enabled Lee to attack McClellan with such vigor  and fierceness that  the young Northern general was forced not only to  retreat, but to fight  against destruction. 
  But the Union mastery of the water, always supreme, was to come  once more  to the relief of the Northern army.  As McClellan made his  retreat,  sometimes losing and sometimes beating off the enemy, but  always leaving  Richmond further and further behind, he had in mind his  fleet in the  James, and then, if pushed to the last extremity, the sea  by which they  had come. 
  But there were many staunch fighters yet in his ranks, and the  Southern  leaders were soon to find that they could not trifle with the  Northern  army even in defeat.  He turned at Malvern Hill, a position  of great  strength, posted well his numerous and powerful artillery,  and beat off  all the efforts of Lee and Jackson and Longstreet and the  two Hills,  and Armistead and the others.  More than five thousand of  the Southern  troops fell in the fruitless charges.  Then McClellan  retreated to the  James River and his gunboats and the forces of the  North were not to come  as near Richmond again for nearly three years. 
  The armies of Lee and Jackson marched back toward the Southern  capital,  for the possession of which forty thousand men had fallen in  the Seven  Days.  Harry rode with Dalton, St. Clair and Langdon.  They  had come  through the inferno unhurt, and while they shared in the  rejoicings of  the Virginia people, they had seen war, continued war,  in its most  terrible aspects, and they felt graver and older. 
  By the side of them marched the thin ranks of the Invincibles, with  the  two colonels, erect and warlike, leading them.  Just ahead was  Stonewall  Jackson, stooped slightly in the saddle, the thoughtful blue  eyes looking  over the heads of his soldiers into the future. 
  &#8220;If he hadn't made that tremendous campaign in the valley,&#8221; said  Dalton,  &#8220;McClellan allied with McDowell would have come here with two  hundred  thousand men and it would have been all over.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But he made it and he saved us,&#8221; said Harry, glancing at his hero. 
  &#8220;And I'm thinking,&#8221; said Happy Tom Langdon, glancing toward the  North,  &#8220;that he'll have to make more like it.  The Yankees will come  again,  stronger than ever.&#8221;
