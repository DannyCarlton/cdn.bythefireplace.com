  The morning after their painful experience with the wasp's nest,   Neewa and Miki rose on four pairs of stiff and swollen legs to  greet  a new day in the deep and mysterious forest into which the  accident of  the previous day had thrown them. The spirit of  irrepressible youth  was upon them, and, though Miki was so swollen  from the stings of the  wasps that his lank body and overgrown legs  were more grotesque than  ever, he was in no way daunted from the  quest of further adventure. 
  The pup's face was as round as a moon, and his head was puffed up   until Neewa might reasonably have had a suspicion that it was on  the  point of exploding. But Miki's eyes&#8212;as much as could be seen  of  them&#8212;were as bright as ever, and his one good ear and his one  half  ear stood up hopefully as he waited for the cub to give some  sign of  what they were going to do. The poison in his system no  longer gave  him discomfort. He felt several sizes too large&#8212;but,  otherwise, quite  well. 
  Neewa, because of his fat, exhibited fewer effects of his battle   with the wasps. His one outstanding defect was an entirely closed   eye. With the other, wide open and alert, he looked about him. In   spite of his one bad eye and his stiff legs he was inspired with  the  optimism of one who at last sees fortune turning his way. He  was rid  of the man-beast, who had killed his mother; the forests  were before  him again, open and inviting, and the rope with which  Challoner had  tied him and Miki together he had successfully  gnawed in two during  the night. Having dispossessed himself of at  least two evils it would  not have surprised him much if he had  seen Noozak, his mother, coming  up from out of the shadows of the  trees. Thought of her made him  whine. And Miki, facing the vast  loneliness of his new world, and  thinking of his master, whined in  reply. 
  Both were hungry. The amazing swiftness with which their   misfortunes had descended upon them had given them no time in  which  to eat. To Miki the change was more than astonishing; it was   overwhelming, and he held his breath in anticipation of some new  evil  while Neewa scanned the forest about them. 
  As if assured by this survey that everything was right, Neewa   turned his back to the sun, which had been his mother's custom,  and  set out. 
  Miki followed. Not until then did he discover that every joint in   his body had apparently disappeared. His neck was stiff, his legs   were like stilts, and five times in as many minutes he stubbed his   clumsy toes and fell down in his efforts to keep up with the cub.  On  top of this his eyes were so nearly closed that his vision was  bad,  and the fifth time he stumbled he lost sight of Neewa  entirely, and  sent out a protesting wail. Neewa stopped and began  prodding with his  nose under a rotten log. When Miki came up Neewa  was flat on his  belly, licking up a colony of big red vinegar ants  as fast as he could  catch them. Miki studied the proceeding for  some moments. It soon  dawned upon him that Neewa was eating  something, but for the life of  him he couldn't make out what it  was. Hungrily he nosed close to  Neewa's foraging snout. He licked  with his tongue where Neewa licked,  and he got only dirt. And all  the time Neewa was giving his jolly  little grunts of satisfaction.  It was ten minutes before he hunted out  the last ant and went on. 
  A little later they came to a small open space where the ground   was wet, and after sniffing about a bit, and focussing his one  good  eye here and there, Neewa suddenly began digging. Very  shortly he drew  out of the ground a white object about the size of  a man's thumb and  began to crunch it ravenously between his jaws.  Miki succeeded in  capturing a fair sized bit of it. Disappointment  followed fast. The  thing was like wood; after rolling it in his  mouth a few times he  dropped it in disgust, and Neewa finished the  remnant of the root with  a thankful grunt. 
  They proceeded. For two heartbreaking hours Miki followed at   Neewa's heels, the void in his stomach increasing as the swelling  in  his body diminished. His hunger was becoming a torture. Yet not  a bit  to eat could he find, while Neewa at every few steps  apparently  discovered something to devour. At the end of the two  hours the cub's  bill of fare had grown to considerable  proportions. It included, among  other things, half a dozen green  and black beetles; numberless bugs,  both hard and soft; whole  colonies of red and black ants; several  white grubs dug out of the  heart of decaying logs; a handful of  snails; a young frog; the egg  of a ground-plover that had failed to  hatch; and, in the vegetable  line, the roots of two camas and one  skunk cabbage. Now and then  he pulled down tender poplar shoots and  nipped the ends off.  Likewise he nibbled spruce and balsam gum  whenever he found it,  and occasionally added to his breakfast a bit of  tender grass. 
  A number of these things Miki tried. He would have eaten the frog,   but Neewa was ahead of him there. The spruce and balsam gum  clogged  up his teeth and almost made him vomit because of its  bitterness.  Between a snail and a stone he could find little  difference, and as  the one bug he tried happened to be that  asafoetida-like creature  known as a stink-bug he made no further  efforts in that direction. He  also bit off a tender tip from a  ground-shoot, but instead of a young  poplar it was Fox-bite, and  shrivelled up his tongue for a quarter of  an hour. At last he  arrived at the conclusion that, up to date, the  one thing in  Neewa's menu that he COULD eat was grass. 
  In the face of his own starvation his companion grew happier as he   added to the strange collection in his stomach. In fact, Neewa   considered himself in clover and was grunting his satisfaction   continually, especially as his bad eye was beginning to open and  he  could see things better. Half a dozen times when he found fresh  ant  nests he invited Miki to the feast with excited little  squeals. Until  noon Miki followed like a faithful satellite at his  heels. The end  came when Neewa deliberately dug into a nest  inhabited by four huge  bumble-bees, smashed them all, and ate  them. 
  From that moment something impressed upon Miki that he must do his   own hunting. With the thought came a new thrill. His eyes were  fairly  open now, and much of the stiffness had gone from his legs.  The blood  of his Mackenzie father and of his half Spitz and half  Airedale mother  rose up in him in swift and immediate demand, and  he began to quest  about for himself. He found a warm scent, and  poked about until a  partridge went up with a tremendous thunder of  wings. It startled him,  but added to the thrill. A few minutes  later, nosing under a pile of  brush, he came face to face with his  dinner. 
  It was Wahboo, the baby rabbit. Instantly Miki was at him, and had   a firm hold at the back of Wahboo's back. Neewa, hearing the  smashing  of the brush and the squealing of the rabbit, stopped  catching ants  and hustled toward the scene of action. The  squealing ceased quickly  and Miki backed himself out and faced  Neewa with Wahboo held  triumphantly in his jaws. The young rabbit  had already given his last  kick, and with a fierce show of  growling Miki began tearing the fur  off. Neewa edged in, grunting  affably. Miki snarled more fiercely.  Neewa, undaunted, continued  to express his overwhelming regard for  Miki in low and  supplicating grunts&#8212;and smelled the rabbit. The snarl  in Miki's  throat died away. He may have remembered that Neewa had  invited  him more than once to partake of his ants and bugs. Together  they  ate the rabbit. Not until the last bit of flesh and the last   tender bone were gone did the feast end, and then Neewa sat back  on  his round bottom and stuck out his little red tongue for the  first  time since he had lost his mother. It was the cub sign of a  full  stomach and a blissful mind. He could see nothing to be more  desired  at the present time than a nap, and stretching himself  languidly he  began looking about for a tree. 
  Miki, on the other hand, was inspired to new action by the   pleasurable sensation of being comfortably filled. Inasmuch as  Neewa  chewed his food very carefully, while Miki, paying small  attention to  mastication, swallowed it in chunks, the pup had  succeeded in getting  away with about four fifths of the rabbit. So  he was no longer hungry.  But he was more keenly alive to his  changed environment than at any  time since he and Neewa had fallen  out of Challoner's canoe into the  rapids. For the first time he  had killed, and for the first time he  had tasted warm blood, and  the combination added to his existence an  excitement that was  greater than any desire he might have possessed to  lie down in a  sunny spot and sleep. Now that he had learned the game,  the  hunting instinct trembled in every fibre of his small being. He   would have gone on hunting until his legs gave way under him if  Neewa  had not found a napping-place. 
  Astonished half out of his wits he watched Neewa as he leisurely   climbed the trunk of a big poplar. He had seen squirrels climb   trees&#8212;just as he had seen birds fly&#8212;but Neewa's performance held   him breathless; and not until the cub had stretched himself out   comfortably in a crotch did Miki express himself. Then he gave an   incredulous yelp, sniffed at the butt of the tree, and made a   half-hearted experiment at the thing himself. One flop on his back   convinced him that Neewa was the tree-climber of the partnership.   Chagrined, he wandered back fifteen or twenty feet and sat down to   study the situation. He could not perceive that Neewa had any  special  business up the tree. Certainly he was not hunting for  bugs. He yelped  half a dozen times, but Neewa made no answer. At  last he gave it up  and flopped himself down with a disconsolate  whine. 
  But it was not to sleep. He was ready and anxious to go on. He   wanted to explore still further the mysterious and fascinating  depths  of the forest. He no longer felt the strange fear that had  been upon  him before he killed the rabbit. In two minutes under  the brush-heap  Nature had performed one of her miracles of  education. In those two  minutes Miki had risen out of whimpering  puppyhood to new power and  understanding. He had passed that  elemental stage which his  companionship with Challoner had  prolonged. He had KILLED, and the hot  thrill of it set fire to  every instinct that was in him. In the half  hour during which he  lay flat on his belly, his head alert and  listening, while Neewa  slept, he passed half way from puppyhood to  dogdom. He would never  know that Hela, his Mackenzie hound father, was  the mightiest  hunter in all the reaches of the Little Fox country, and  that  alone he had torn down a bull caribou. But he FELT it. There was   something insistent and demanding in the call. And because he was   answering that call, and listening eagerly to the whispering  voices  of the forest, his quick ears caught the low, chuckling  monotone of  Kawook, the porcupine. 
  Miki lay very still. A moment later he heard the soft clicking of   quills, and then Kawook came out in the open and stood up on his  hind  feet in a patch of sunlight. 
  For thirteen years Kawook had lived undisturbed in this particular   part of the wilderness, and in his old age he weighed thirty  pounds  if he weighed an ounce. On this afternoon, coming for his  late dinner,  he was feeling even more than usually happy. His  eyesight at best was  dim. Nature had never intended him to see  very far, and had therefore  quilted him heavily with the barbed  shafts of his protecting armour.  Thirty feet away he was entirely  oblivious of Miki, at least  apparently so; and Miki hugged the  ground closer, warned by the  swiftly developing instinct within  him that here was a creature it  would be unwise to attack. 
  For perhaps a minute Kawook stood up, chuckling his tribal song   without any visible movement of his body. He stood profile to  Miki,  like a fat alderman. He was so fat that his stomach bulged  out in  front like the half of a balloon, and over this stomach his  hands were  folded in a peculiarly human way, so that he looked  more like an old  she-porcupine than a master in his tribe. 
  It was not until then that Miki observed Iskwasis, the young   female porcupine, who had poked herself slyly out from under a  bush  near Kawook. In spite of his years the red thrill of romance  was not  yet gone from the old fellow's bones, and he immediately  started to  give an exhibition of his good breeding and elegance.  He began with  his ludicrous love-making dance, hopping from one  foot to the other  until his fat stomach shook, and chuckling  louder than ever. The  charms of Iskwasis were indeed sufficient to  turn the head of an older  beau than Kawook. She was a distinctive  blonde; in other words, one of  those unusual creatures of her  kind, an albino. Her nose was pink, the  palms of her little feet  were pink, and each of her pretty pink eyes  was set in an iris of  sky-blue. It was evident that she did not regard  old Kawook's  passion-dance with favour and sensing this fact Kawook  changed his  tactics and falling on all four feet began to chase his  spiky tail  as if he had suddenly gone mad. When he stopped, and looked  to see  what effect he had made he was clearly knocked out by the fact   that Iskwasis had disappeared. 
  For another minute he sat stupidly, without making a sound. Then   to Miki's consternation he started straight for the tree in which   Neewa was sleeping. As a matter of fact, it was Kawook's dinner-   tree, and he began climbing it, talking to himself all the time.   Miki's hair began to stand on end. He did not know that Kawook,  like  all his kind, was the best-natured fellow in the world, and  had never  harmed anything in his life unless assaulted first.  Lacking this  knowledge he set up a sudden frenzy of barking to  warn Neewa. 
  Neewa roused himself slowly, and when he opened his eyes he was   looking into a spiky face that sent him into a convulsion of  alarm.  With a suddenness that came within an ace of toppling him  from his  crotch he swung over and scurried higher up the tree.  Kawook was not  at all excited. Now that Iskwasis was gone he was  entirely absorbed in  the anticipation of his dinner. He continued  to clamber slowly upward,  and at this the horrified Neewa backed  himself out on a limb in order  that Kawook might have an  unobstructed trail up the tree. 
  Unfortunately for Neewa it was on this limb that Kawook had eaten   his last meal, and he began working himself out on it, still   apparently oblivious of the fact that the cub was on the same  branch.  At this Miki sent up such a series of shrieking yelps from  below that  Kawook seemed at last to realize that something unusual  was going on.  He peered down at Miki who was making vain efforts  to jump up the  trunk of the tree; then he turned and, for the  first time,  contemplated Neewa with some sign of interest. Neewa  was hugging the  limb with both forearms and both hind legs. To  retreat another foot on  the branch that was already bending  dangerously under his weight  seemed impossible. 
  It was at this point that Kawook began to scold fiercely. With a   final frantic yelp Miki sat back on his haunches and watched the   thrilling drama above him. A little at a time Kawook advanced, and   inch by inch Neewa retreated, until at last he rolled clean over  and  was hanging with his back toward the ground. It was then that  Kawook  ceased his scolding and calmly began eating his dinner. For  two or  three minutes Neewa kept his hold. Twice he made efforts to  pull  himself up so that he could get the branch under him. Then  his hind  feet slipped. For a dozen seconds he hung with his two  front  paws&#8212;then shot down through fifteen feet of space to the  ground.  Close to Miki he landed with a thud that knocked the wind  out of him.  He rose with a grunt, took one dazed look up the tree,  and without  further explanation to Miki began to leg it deeper  into the  forest&#8212;straight into the face of the great adventure  which was to be  the final test for these two.
