  Huddled behind a rock which was scarcely larger than his body,   groveling in the white, soft sand like a turtle making a nest for  its  eggs, Carrigan told himself this without any reservation. He  was, as  he kept repeating to himself for the comfort of his soul,  in a deuce  of a fix. His head was bare&#8212;simply because a bullet  had taken his hat  away. His blond hair was filled with sand. His  face was sweating. But  his blue eyes were alight with a grim sort  of humor, though he knew  that unless the other fellow's ammunition  ran out he was going to die. 
  For the twentieth time in as many minutes he looked about him. He   was in the center of a flat area of sand. Fifty feet from him the   river murmured gently over yellow bars and a carpet of pebbles.  Fifty  feet on the opposite side of him was the cool, green wall of  the  forest. The sunshine playing in it seemed like laughter to him  now, a  whimsical sort of merriment roused by the sheer effrontery  of the joke  which fate had inflicted upon him. 
  Between the river and the balsam and spruce was only the rock   behind which he was cringing like a rabbit afraid to take to the   open. And his rock was a mere up-jutting of the solid floor of  shale  that was under him. The wash sand that covered it like a  carpet was  not more than four or five inches deep. He could not  dig in. There was  not enough of it within reach to scrape up as a  protection. And his  enemy, a hundred yards or so away, was a  determined wretch&#8212;and the  deadliest shot he had ever known. 
  Three times Carrigan had made experiments to prove this, for he   had in mind a sudden rush to the shelter of the timber. Three  times  he had raised the crown of his hat slightly above the top of  the rock,  and three times the marksmanship of the other had  perforated it with  neatness and dispatch. The third bullet had  carried his hat a dozen  feet away. Whenever he showed a patch of  his clothing, a bullet  replied with unerring precision. Twice they  had drawn blood. And the  humor faded out of Carrigan's eyes. 
  Not long ago he had exulted in the bigness and glory of this   country of his, where strong men met hand to hand and eye to eye.   There were the other kind in it, the sort that made his profession  of  manhunting a thing of reality and danger, but he expected   these&#8212;forgot them&#8212;when the wilderness itself filled his vision.  But  his present situation was something unlike anything that had  ever  happened in his previous experience with the outlawed. He had  faced  dangers. He had fought. There were times when he had almost  died.  Fanchet, the half-breed who had robbed a dozen wilderness  mail  sledges, had come nearest to trapping him and putting him out  of  business. Fanchet was a desperate man and had few scruples. But  even  Fanchet&#8212;before he was caught&#8212;would not have cornered a man  with such  bloodthirsty unfairness as Carrigan found himself  cornered now. He no  longer had a doubt as to what was in the  other's mind. It was not to  wound and make merely helpless. It was  to kill. It was not difficult  to prove this. Careful not to expose  a part of his arm or shoulder, he  drew a white handkerchief from  his pocket, fastened it to the end of  his rifle, and held the flag  of surrender three feet above the rock.  And then, with equal  caution, he slowly thrust up a flat piece of  shale, which at a  distance of a hundred yards might appear as his  shoulder or even  his head. Scarcely was it four inches above the top  of the rock  before there came the report of a rifle, and the shale was   splintered into a hundred bits. 
  Carrigan lowered his flag and gathered himself in tighter. The   accuracy of the other's marksmanship was appalling. He knew that  if  he exposed himself for an instant to use his own rifle or the  heavy  automatic in his holster, he would be a dead man before he  could press  a trigger. And that time, he felt equally sure, would  come sooner or  later. His muscles were growing cramped. He could  not forever double  himself up like a four-bladed jackknife behind  the altogether  inefficient shelter of the rock. 
  His executioner was hidden in the edge of the timber, not directly   opposite him, but nearly a hundred yards down stream. Twenty times  he  had wondered why the fiend with the rifle did not creep up  through  that timber and take a good, open pot-shot at him from the  vantage  point which lay at the end of a straight line between his  rock and the  nearest spruce and balsam. From that angle he could  not completely  shelter himself. But the man a hundred yards below  had not moved a  foot from his ambush since he had fired his first  shot. That had come  when Carrigan was crossing the open space of  soft, white sand. It had  left a burning sensation at his temple&#8212;  half an inch to the right and  it would have killed him. Swift as  the shot itself, he dropped behind  the one protection at hand, the  up-jutting shoulder of shale. 
  For a quarter of an hour he had been making efforts to wriggle   himself free from his bulky shoulder-pack without exposing himself  to  a coup-de-grace. At last he had the thing off. It was a  tremendous  relief when he thrust it out beside the rock, almost  doubling the size  of his shelter. Instantly there came the crash  of a bullet in it, and  then another. He heard the rattle of pans,  and wondered if his skillet  would be any good after today. 
  For the first time he could wipe the sweat from his face and   stretch himself. And also he could think. Carrigan possessed an   unalterable faith in the infallibility of the mind. &quot;You can do   anything with the mind,&quot; was his code. &quot;It is better than a good   gun.&quot; 
  Now that he was physically more at ease, he began reassembling his   scattered mental faculties. Who was this stranger who was pot-   shotting at him with such deadly animosity from the ambush below?   Who&#8212; 
  Another crash of lead in tinware and steel put an unpleasant   emphasis to the question. It was so close to his head that it made   him wince, and now&#8212;with a wide area within reach about him&#8212;he  began  scraping up the sand for an added protection. There came a  long  silence after that third clatter of distress from his cooking   utensils. To David Carrigan, even in his hour of deadly peril,  there  was something about it that for an instant brought back the  glow of  humor in his eyes. It was hot, swelteringly hot, in that  packet of  sand with the unclouded sun almost straight overhead. He  could have  tossed a pebble to where a bright-eyed sandpiper was  cocking itself  backward and forward, its jerky movements  accompanied by friendly  little tittering noises. Everything about  him seemed friendly. The  river rippled and murmured in cooling  song just beyond the sandpiper.  On the other side the still cooler  forest was a paradise of shade and  contentment, astir with subdued  and hidden life. It was nesting  season. He heard the twitter of  birds. A tiny, brown wood warbler  fluttered out to the end of a  silvery birch limb, and it seemed to  David that its throat must  surely burst with the burden of its song.  The little fellow's  brown body, scarcely larger than a butternut, was  swelling up like  a round ball in his effort to vanquish all other  song. 
  &quot;Go to it, old man,&quot; chuckled Carrigan. &quot;Go to it!&quot; 
  The little warbler, that he might have crushed between thumb and   forefinger, gave him a lot of courage. 
  Then the tiny chorister stopped for breath. In that interval   Carrigan listened to the wrangling of two vivid-colored Canada  jays  deeper in the timber. Chronic scolds they were, never without  a  grouch. They were like some people Carrigan had known, born   pessimists, always finding something to complain about, even in  their  love days. 
  And these were love days. That was the odd thought that came to   Carrigan as he lay half on his face, his fingers slowly and   cautiously working a loophole between his shoulder-pack and the  rock.  They were love days all up and down the big rivers, where  men and  women sang for joy, and children played, forgetful of the  long, hard  days of winter. And in forest, plain, and swamp was  this spirit of  love also triumphant over the land. It was the  mating season of all  feathered things. In countless nests were the  peeps and twitters of  new life; mothers of first-born were  teaching their children to swim  and fly; from end to end of the  forest world the little children of  the silent places, furred and  feathered, clawed and hoofed, were  learning the ways of life.  Nature's yearly birthday was half-way gone,  and the doors of  nature's school wide open. And the tiny brown  songster at the end  of his birch twig proclaimed the joy of it again,  and challenged  all the world to beat him in his adulation. 
  Carrigan found that he could peer between his pack and the rock to   where the other warbler was singing&#8212;and where his enemy lay  watching  for the opportunity to kill. It was taking a chance. If a  movement  betrayed his loophole, his minutes were numbered. But he  had worked  cautiously, an inch at a time, and was confident that  the beginning of  his effort to fight back was, up to the present  moment, undiscovered.  He believed that he knew about where the  ambushed man was concealed.  In the edge of a low-hanging mass of  balsam was a fallen cedar. From  behind the butt of that cedar he  was sure the shots had come. 
  And now, even more cautiously than he had made the tiny opening,   he began to work the muzzle of his rifle through the loophole. As  he  did this he was thinking of Black Roger Audemard. And yet,  almost as  quickly as suspicion leaped into his mind, he told  himself that the  thing was impossible. It could not be Black  Roger, or one of Black  Roger's friends, behind the cedar log. The  idea was inconceivable,  when he considered how carefully the  secret of his mission had been  kept at the Landing. He had not  even said goodby to his best friends.  And because Black Roger had  won through all the preceding years,  Carrigan was stalking his  prey out of uniform. There had been nothing  to betray him.  Besides, Black Roger Audemard must be at least a  thousand miles  north, unless something had tempted him to come up the  rivers with  the spring brigades. If he used logic at all, there was  but one  conclusion for him to arrive at. The man in ambush was some   rascally half-breed who coveted his outfit and whatever valuables  he  might have about his person. 
  A fourth smashing eruption among his comestibles and culinary   possessions came to drive home the fact that even that analysis of   the situation was absurd. Whoever was behind the rifle fire had  small  respect for the contents of his pack, and he was surely not  in  grievous need of a good gun or ammunition. A sticky mess of  condensed  cream was running over Carrigan's hand. He doubted if  there was a  whole tin in his kit. 
  For a few moments he lay quietly on his face after the fourth   shot. His eyes were turned toward the river, and on the far side,  a  quarter of a mile away, three canoes were moving swiftly up the  slow  current of the stream. The sunlight flashed on their wet  sides. The  gleam of dripping paddles was like the flutter of  silvery birds'  wings, and across the water came an unintelligible  shout in response  to the rifle shot. It occurred to David that he  might make a trumpet  of his hands and shout back, but the distance  was too great for his  voice to carry its message for help.  Besides, now that he had the  added protection of the pack, he felt  a certain sense of humiliation  at the thought of showing the white  feather. A few minutes more, if  all went well, and he would settle  for the man behind the log. 
  He continued again the slow operation of worming his rifle barrel   between the pack and the rock. The near-sighted little sandpiper  had  discovered him and seemed interested in the operation. It had  come a  dozen feet nearer, and was perking its head and seesawing  on its long  legs as it watched with inquisitive inspection the  unusual  manifestation of life behind the rock. Its twittering note  had changed  to an occasional sharp and querulous cry. Carrigan  wanted to wring its  neck. That cry told the other fellow that he  was still alive and  moving. 
  It seemed an age before his rifle was through, and every moment he   expected another shot. He flattened himself out, Indian fashion,  and  sighted along the barrel. He was positive that his enemy was  watching,  yet he could make out nothing that looked like a head  anywhere along  the log. At one end was a clump of deeper foliage.  He was sure he saw  a sudden slight movement there, and in the  thrill of the moment was  tempted to send a bullet into the heart  of it. But he saved his  cartridge. He felt the mighty importance  of certainty. If he fired  once&#8212;and missed&#8212;the advantage of his  unsuspected loophole would be  gone. It would be transformed into a  deadly menace. Even as it was, if  his enemy's next bullet should  enter that way&#8212; 
  He felt the discomfort of the thought, and in spite of himself a   tremor of apprehension ran up his spine. He felt an even greater   desire to wring the neck of the inquisitive little sandpiper. The   creature had circled round squarely in front of him and stood  there  tilting its tail and bobbing its head as if its one insane  desire was  to look down the length of his rifle barrel. The bird  was giving him  away. If the other fellow was only half as clever  as his marksmanship  was good&#8212; 
  Suddenly every nerve in Carrigan's body tightened. He was positive   that he had caught the outline of a human head and shoulders in  the  foliage. His finger pressed gently against the trigger of his   Winchester. Before he breathed again he would have fired. But a  shot  from the foliage beat him out by the fraction of a second. In  that  precious time lost, his enemy's bullet entered the edge of  his  kit&#8212;and came through. He felt the shock of it, and in the   infinitesimal space between the physical impact and the mental  effect  of shock his brain told him the horrible thing had  happened. It was  his head&#8212;his face. It was as if he had plunged  them suddenly into hot  water, and what was left of his skull was  filled with the rushing and  roaring of a flood. He staggered up,  clutching his face with both  hands. The world about him was  twisted and black, a dizzily revolving  thing&#8212;yet his still  fighting mental vision pictured clearly for him a  monstrous,  bulging-eyed sandpiper as big as a house. Then he toppled  back on  the white sand, his arms flung out limply, his face turned to  the  ambush wherein his murderer lay. 
  His body was clear of the rock and the pack, but there came no   other shot from the thick clump of balsam. Nor, for a time, was  there  movement. The wood warbler was cheeping inquiringly at this  sudden  change in the deportment of his friend behind the shoulder  of shale.  The sandpiper, a bit startled, had gone back to the edge  of the river  and was running a race with himself along the wet  sand. And the two  quarrelsome jays had brought their family  squabble to the edge of the  timber. 
  It was their wrangling that roused Carrigan to the fact that he   was not dead. It was a thrilling discovery&#8212;that and the fact that  he  made out clearly a patch of sunlight in the sand. He did not  move, but  opened his eyes wider. He could see the timber. On a  straight line  with his vision was the thick clump of balsam. And  as he looked, the  boughs parted and a figure came out. Carrigan  drew a deep breath. He  found that it did not hurt him. He gripped  the fingers of the hand  that was under his body, and they closed  on the butt of his service  automatic. He would win yet, if God  gave him life a few minutes  longer. 
  His enemy advanced. As he drew nearer, Carrigan closed his eyes   more and more. They must be shut, and he must appear as if dead,  when  the other came up. Then, when the scoundrel put down his gun,  as he  naturally would&#8212;his chance would be at hand. If a quiver of  his eyes  betrayed him&#8212; 
  He closed them tight. Dizziness began to creep over him, and the   fire in his brain grew hot again. He heard footsteps, and they   stopped in the sand close beside him. Then he heard a human voice.  It  did not speak in words, but gave utterance to a strange and  unnatural  cry. With a mighty effort Carrigan assembled his last  strength. It  seemed to him that he brought himself up quickly, but  his movement was  slow, painful&#8212;the effort of a man who might be  dying. The automatic  hung limply in his hand, its muzzle pointing  to the sand. He looked  up, trying to swing into action that mighty  weight of his weapon. And  then from his own lips, even in his  utter physical impotence, fell a  cry of wonder and amazement. 
  His enemy stood there in the sunlight, staring down at him with   big, dark eyes that were filled with horror. They were not the  eyes  of a man. David Carrigan, in this most astounding moment of  his life,  found himself looking up into the face of a woman.
