  I have thus traced in detail the steps by which Harry Walton  ascended from the condition of a poor farmer's son to the influential  position of editor of a weekly newspaper. I call to mind now, however,  that he is no longer a boy, and his future career will be of less  interest to my young readers. Yet I hope they may be interested to  hear, though not in detail, by what successive steps he rose still  higher in position and influence.
  Harry was approaching his twenty-first birthday when he was waited  upon by a deputation of citizens from a neighboring town, inviting him  to deliver a Fourth of July oration. He was at first disposed, out of  modesty, to decline; but, on consultation with Ferguson, decided to  accept and do his best. He was ambitious to produce a good impression,  and his experience in the Debating Society gave him a moderate degree  of confidence and self-reliance. When the time came he fully satisfied  public expectation. I do not say that his oration was a model of  eloquence, for that could not have been expected of one whose  advantages had been limited, and one for whom I have never claimed  extraordinary genius. But it certainly was well written and well  delivered, and very creditable to the young orator. The favor with  which it was received may have had something to do in influencing the  people of Centreville to nominate and elect him, to the New Hampshire  Legislature a few months later.
  He entered that body, the youngest member in it. But his long  connection with a Debating Society, and the experience he had gained in  parliamentary proceedings, enabled him at once to become a useful  working Member. He was successively re-elected for several years,  during which he showed such practical ability that he obtained a State  reputation. At twenty-eight he received a nomination for Congress, and  was elected by a close vote. During all this time he remained in charge  of the Centreville &#8220;Gazette,&#8221; but of course had long relinquished the  task of a compositor into his brother's hands. He had no foolish ideas  about this work being beneath him; but he felt that he could employ his  time more profitably in other ways. Under his judicious management, the  &#8220;Gazette&#8221; attained a circulation and influence that it had never before  reached. The income derived from it was double that which it yielded in  the days of his predecessor; and both he and Ferguson were enabled to  lay by a few hundred dollars every year. But Harry had never sought  wealth. He was content with a comfortable support and a competence. He  liked influence and the popular respect, and he was gratified by the  important trusts which he received. He was ambitious, but it was a  creditable and honorable ambition. He sought to promote the public  welfare, and advance the public interests, both as a speaker and as a  writer; and though sometimes misrepresented, the people on the whole  did him justice.
  A few weeks after he had taken his seat in Congress, a young man was  ushered into his private room. Looking up, he saw a man of about his  own age, dressed with some attempt at style, but on the whole wearing a  look of faded gentility.
  &#8220;Mr. Walton,&#8221; said the visitor, with some hesitation.
  &#8220;That is my name. Won't you take a seat?&#8221;
  The visitor sat down, but appeared ill at ease. He nervously fumbled  at his hat, and did not speak.
  &#8220;Can I do anything for you?&#8221; asked Harry, at length.
  &#8220;I see you don't know me,&#8221; said the stranger.
  &#8220;I can't say I recall your features; but then I see a great many  persons.&#8221;
  &#8220;I went to school at the Prescott Academy, when you were in the  office of the Centreville 'Gazette.'&#8220;
  Harry looked more closely, and exclaimed, in astonished recognition,  &#8220;Fitzgerald Fletcher!&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said the other, flushing with mortification, &#8220;I am Fitzgerald  Fletcher.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am glad to see you,&#8221; said Harry, cordially, forgetting the old  antagonism that had existed between them.
  He rose and offered his hand, which Fletcher took with an air of  relief, for he had felt uncertain of his reception.
  &#8220;You have prospered wonderfully,&#8221; said Fletcher, with a shade of  envy.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry, smiling. &#8220;I was a printer's devil when you knew  me; but I never meant to stay in that position. I have risen from the  ranks.&#8221;
  &#8220;I haven't,&#8221; said Fletcher, bitterly.
  &#8220;Have you been unfortunate? Tell me about it, if you don't mind,&#8221;  said Harry, sympathetically.
  &#8220;My father failed three years ago,&#8221; said Fletcher, &#8220;and I found  myself adrift with nothing to do, and no money to fall back upon. I  have drifted about since then; but now I am out of employment. I came  to you to-day to see if you will exert your influence to get me a  government clerkship, even of the lowest class. You may rest assured,  Mr. Walton, that I need it.&#8221;
  Was this the proud Fitzgerald Fletcher, suing, for the means of  supporting himself, to one whom, as a boy, he had despised and looked  down upon? Surely, the world is full of strange changes and mutations  of fortune. Here was a chance for Harry to triumph over his old enemy;  but he never thought of doing it. Instead, he was filled with sympathy  for one who, unlike himself, had gone down in the social scale, and he  cordially promised to see what he could do for Fletcher, and that  without delay.
  On inquiry, he found that Fletcher was qualified to discharge the  duties of a clerk, and secured his appointment to a clerkship in the  Treasury Department, on a salary of twelve hundred dollars a year. It  was an income which Fletcher would once have regarded as wholly  insufficient for his needs; but adversity had made him humble, and he  thankfully accepted it. He holds the position still, discharging the  duties satisfactorily. He is glad to claim the Hon. Harry Walton among  his acquaintances, and never sneers at him now as a &#8220;printer's devil.&#8221;
  Oscar Vincent spent several years abroad, after graduation, acting  as foreign correspondent of his father's paper. He is now his father's  junior partner, and is not only respected for his ability, but a  general favorite in society, on account of his sunny disposition and  cordial good nature. He keeps up his intimacy with Harry Walton.  Indeed, there is good reason for this, since Harry, four years since,  married his sister Maud, and the two friends are brothers-in-law.
  Harry's parents are still living, no longer weighed down by poverty,  as when we first made their acquaintance. The legacy which came so  opportunely improved their condition, and provided them with comforts  to which they had long been strangers. But their chief satisfaction  comes from Harry's unlooked-for success in life. Their past life of  poverty and privation is all forgotten in their gratitude for this  great happiness.
 
  The next and concluding volume of this series will be
