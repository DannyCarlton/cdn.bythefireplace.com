Betty went very often to the Senate Gallery in these days, for it was  the only place where one might have relief from the eternal subject of  Cuba. Although the House broke loose under cover of the Diplomatic and  Consular Appropriation Bill when it was in the Committee of the Whole  and free of the Speaker's iron hand, and raged for two days with the  vehemence of long-repressed passion, the Senate permitted only an  occasional spurt from its warlike members, and pursued its even way  with the important bills before it. But at teas, dinners, luncheons,  and receptions people chattered with amiability or in suavity about  the hostile demonstrations at Havana against Americans, the Spanish  Minister's letter, Spain's demand for the recall of Consul-General  Lee, the dying reconcentrados, the exploits of the insurgents, and the  general possibilities of war. The old Madison house, which had ignored  politics for half a century, vibrated with polite excitement on  Thursday evenings. About a hundred people came to these receptions,  which finished with a supper, and it was understood that the free  expression of opinion should be the rule; consequently several  repressed members of both Houses delivered impromptu speeches, in the  guise of toasts, before that select audience; much to the amusement of  Senator North and the Speaker of the House. Burleigh's was really  impassioned and brilliant; and Armstrong's, if woolly in its phrasing  and Populistic in its length, was sufficiently entertaining.    
As for Mrs. Madison, she became imbued with the fear that war would be  declared in her house. Two Cabinet ministers had been added to the  <i>salon</i>, and what they in conjunction with the colossal Speaker and  Senators North and Ward might accomplish if they cared to try, was  appalling to contemplate. She begged Betty to adjourn the <i>salon</i> till  peace had come again.    
But to this Betty would not hearken. It was the sun of her week,  through whose heavy clouds flickered the pale stars of distractions  for which she was beginning to care little. One of life's  compensations is that there is always something ahead, some trifling  event of interest or pleasure upon which one may fix one's eye and  endeavour to forget the dreary tissue of monotony and commonplace  between. Betty found herself acquiring the habit of casting her eye  over the day as soon as she awoke in the morning, and if nothing  distracting presented itself, she planned for something as well as she  could.    
She endeavoured to introduce the pleasant English custom of asking a  few congenial spirits to come for a cup of afternoon tea. These little  informal reunions are among the most delightful episodes of London  life, and if established as a custom in Washington would be like the  greenest of oases in the whirling breathless sandstorms of that social  Sahara. But even Betty Madison, strong as she was both in position and  personality, met with but a moderate success. When women have from six  to twenty-five calls to pay every afternoon of the season, with at  least one tea a day besides, they have little time or inclination for  pleasant informalities. Doubtless Miss Madison's friends felt that  they should be relieved of the additional tax. Even the women of the  fashionable set, which includes some of the Old Washingtonians and  many newer comers of equally high degree, and which ignores the  official set, preserve the same ridiculous fashion of calling in  person six days in the week instead of merely leaving cards as in  older and more civilized communities. In London, society has learned  to combine the maximum of pleasure with the minimum of work.  Washington society is its antithesis; and although many of the most  brilliant men in America are in its official set, and the brightest  and most charming women in its fashionable as well as political set,  they are, through the exigencies of the old social structure, of  little use to each other. Betty occasionally managed to capture three  or four people who talked delightfully when they felt they had time to  indulge in consecutive sentences, but as a rule people came on her  reception day only, and many of them walked in at one door of her  drawing-room and out at the other.    
The debate in the Senate on the payment of bonds interested her  deeply, for she knew that it meant days of uneasiness for Senator  North, who rarely was absent from his seat. His brief speech on the  subject was the finest she had heard him make, and although it was  bitter and sarcastic while he was arraigning the adherents of the  resolution to pay the government debt in silver, he became impersonal  and almost impassioned as he argued in behalf of national honesty.    
Betty never had seen him so close to excitement, and she wondered if  he found it a relief to speak out on any subject. But if he ever  thought of her down there he made no sign, for he neither raised his  eyes to the gallery nor did he pay her a second visit in her select  but conspicuous precinct.    
The resolution passed the Senate, and on that evening Senator North  called at the Madison house. It was two weeks since he had called  before, and although he had come to her evenings and they had met at  several dinners, they had not attempted conversation.    
The Montgomery's and Carters had dined at the house, and all were in  the parlour when he arrived. After a few minutes he was able to talk  apart with Betty. They moved gradually toward the end of the room and  sat down on a small sofa.    
"I am glad you came to-night," she said. "It was my impulse to go to  you when I heard how the vote had gone."    
"I knew it," he replied, "and if I could have come straight up here to  the old room, I should have hung up the vote with my overcoat in the  hall."    
He looked harassed, and his eyes, while they had lost nothing of their  magnetic power, were less calmly penetrating than usual. They looked  as if their fires had been unloosed more than once of late and were  under indifferent control.    
"You will not come to that room again!"    
"No. And I soon shall cease to come here at all except on Thursdays."    
"You almost have done that now. I think I get more satisfaction  watching you from the gallery than anything else. You look very calm  and senatorial, and you always are standing some one in a corner who  is trying to make a speech."    
"I am relieved to know that I do not inspire the amazement of my  colleagues. It is a long while since I have felt calm and senatorial,  however. But these are days for alertness of mind, and even the most  distracting of women must be shut up in her cupboard and forgotten for  a few hours every day."    
"I think I rather like that."    
"Of course you do. A woman always likes a strong lover. And you have  plenty of revenge, if you did but know."    
"I know," she said; and as she raised her eyes and looked at him  steadily, he believed her.    
"Tell me at least that you miss coming to that room--I want to hear  you say it."    
"Good God!"    
Betty caught her breath. But when women feel fire between their  fingers and are reckless before the swift approach of a greater  wretchedness than that possessing them, they are merciless to  themselves and the man.    
"Can you stay away?" she whispered. "Can you?"    
"It is the one thing I can do."    
"Do you realize what you are saying?--that you have put me aside for  ever? Are you willing to admit that it is all over? How am I to live  on and on and on? Can you fancy me alone next summer in the  Adirondacks--"    
"Hush! Hush! Do you wish me to come? Answer me honestly, without any  feminine subterfuge."    
"No, I do not."  "And I should not come if you did, for I know the price we both should  pay better than you do, and only complete happiness could justify such  a step. You and I could find happiness in marriage only--we both  demand too much! But I also know that the higher faculties of the mind  do not always prevail, and I shall not see you alone again."    
She pushed him further. "You take this philosophically because you  have loved before and recovered. You feel sure that no love lasts."    
"When a man loves as I love you, he has no past. There are no  experiences alive in his memory to help him to philosophy. With the  entire world the last love is the only love. As for myself, I shall  not love again and I shall not recover."    
"I wore white because I knew you would come tonight," she said softly.    
"Yes, and you would torment me if I went down on my knees and begged  for mercy."    
"Senator," said Montgomery, approaching them. "I suppose it is some  satisfaction to you to know that that resolution cannot pass the  House."    
"I hope you will make a speech on the subject that will look well in  the Record," said North, with some sarcasm.    
Montgomery laughed. "That is a good suggestion. I wonder if some of  our orators ever read themselves over in cold blood. The back numbers  of the Record ought to be a solemn warning."    
"Unfortunately most people don't know when they have made fools of  themselves; that is one reason the world grows wise so slowly. I don't  doubt your speech will look well. You've been remarkably sane for a  young man of enthusiasms. Reserve some of your logic, however, for the  greater conflict that is coming. The pressure on the President is  becoming very severe, and the worst of it is that a great part of it  comes from Congressmen of his own party."    
"One of our Populists has christened these 'kickers' 'the  reconcentrados;' which is not bad, as there is said to be a kickers'  caucus in process of organization. But if the pressure on the  President is severe, it is equally so on us, and I suppose the  'kickers' are those who have one knob too few in their backbones.  Some, however, have got the war bee inside their skulls instead of in  their hats, and will be fit subjects for a lunatic asylum if the thing  doesn't end soon, one way or another. And they reiterate and reiterate  that they don't want war, when they know that any determined step we  can take is bound to lead to it. I have no patience with them. They  either are fools or are trying to keep on both sides of the fence at  once."    
"Politics are very complicated," said Senator North, dryly.    
"How do you and Mary manage to live in the same house?" asked Betty.  "She is all for war."    
"Oh, I think she rather likes the opportunity to argue. And she is so  divided between the desire for me to be a good American and the desire  that England shall have an excuse to hug us that she could not get  into a temper over it if she tried. She has made no attempt to  influence my course. Heaven knows how much money I've been made to  disburse in behalf of the reconcentrados, but I like women to be  tender-hearted and would not harden them for the sake of a few  dollars, even were they dumped in Havana Harbor--By the way, I wonder  if the <i>Maine</i> is all right down there? She has the city under her  guns, and they know it--"    
"Oh, for heaven's sake, don't suggest any new horrors," said Senator  North, rising. "Besides, the Spaniards are not in the final stages of  idiocy. It would be like the New York <i>Journal</i> to blow up the  <i>Maine</i>, as it seems to have reached that stage of hysteria which  betokens desperation; but the ship is safe as far as the Spaniards are  concerned."    
Lady Mary rose to go; and Betty, who was informal with her friends,  went out into the hall with her instead of ringing for a servant.  Senator North remained in the parlor for a few moments to say good-  night to Mrs. Madison and the Carters, and Betty, although the  Montgomerys did not linger, waited for him to come out. There was  nothing to reflect the light in the dark walls of the large square  hall, and it always was shadowy, and provocative to lovers at any  time.    
When he entered it, he looked at her for a moment without speaking,  and did not approach her.    
"You might be the ghost of another Betty Madison--in that white gown,"  he said. "Was there not a famous one in the days of 1812, and did she  not love a British officer--or something of that sort?"    
"They parted here in this hall--and she lived on and died of old age.  Such is life. I sleep in her bed, where, I suppose, she suffered much  as I do."    
She came forward and pushed her hand into his. "I am not a ghost," she  said.    
He too believed it to be their last meeting alone, and he raised her  hand to his lips and held it there.    
"I wish we could have stayed on and on in the Adirondacks," she said  unsteadily. "Everything seemed to go well with us there."    
"People in mid-ocean usually are happy and irresponsible. They would  not be if it were anything but an intermediate state. But it is enough  to know that on land our troubles are waiting for us."    
She shivered and drew closer to him. The dangerous fire in her eyes  faded.    
"Mine are becoming very great," she said. "All I can do is to distract  my mind, to fill up my time."    
"And I can do nothing to help you! That is the tragedy of a love like  ours: the more a man loves a woman he cannot marry the more he must  make her suffer--either way; it is simply a choice of methods, and if  he really loves her he chooses the least complicated."    
"It is bad enough."    
Her eyes filled for the first time in his presence since the morning  of Harriet's death, but her mental temper was very different, and she  looked at him steadily through her tears.    
"<i>I</i> cannot help <i>you</i>," she said. "That is the hardest part. You are  harassed in many ways, and you are dreading the bitterness of a  greater defeat than today. I could be so much to you--so much. And I  can be nothing. By that time you will have ceased to come here. I know  that you mean not to come again after to-night, except when the house  is full of company."    
He began to answer, but stopped. She felt his heart against her arm,  and his lips burnt her hand, his eyes her own.    
"Listen," she said rapidly, "if war should be declared I shall be in  the gallery to hear it. I will come straight home and shut myself up  in my boudoir--for hours--to be with you in a way--Shall I? Will--  would it mean anything to you?"    
"Of course it would!"    
His face was fully unmasked, and she moved abruptly to it as to a  magnet. In another moment they were in the more certain seclusion of  the vestibule, and she was in his arms. They clung together with a  passion which despair with ironic compensation made perfect, and their  first kiss which was to be their last expressed for a moment the  longing of the year of their love and of the years that were to come.  That such a moment ever could end was so incredible that when Betty  suddenly found herself alone she looked about in every direction for  him, and then the blood rushed through her in a tide of impotent fury.    
It was this blind rage that enabled her to go back to the parlor and  keep up until the Carters went home a few moments later, and her  mother had gone to bed. Then she went to her boudoir and locked  herself in.    
How she got through that night without sending him an imperious  summons she never knew, unless it were that she found some measure of  relief in a letter she wrote to him. If she could not see him, he was  still her lover, her only intimate friend, and her confessor. She  promised not to write again, but she demanded what help he could give  her.    
She sent the letter in the morning, and he replied at once:--    
I know. Do you think it was necessary to tell me? Do you suppose my  mind left you for a moment last night, and that I know and love you so  little that I failed to imagine and understand in a single particular?  If I were less of a man and more of a god, I should go to you and give  you the help you need, but I am only strong enough to keep away from  you. Not in thought, however,--if that is any help.    
We shall meet in public and speak together. I have no desire to forget  you nor that you should forget me. We neither of us shall forget, but  we shall live and endure, as the strongest of us always do. You tell  me that you are tormented by the thought that you have added to my  trials. Remember that all other trials sink into insignificance beside  this, and yet that this greatest that has come to me in a long life is  glorified by the fact of its existence. And if it is almost a relief  to know that I shall not see you alone again, it is a satisfaction and  a joy to remember that I have kissed you. R.N.
