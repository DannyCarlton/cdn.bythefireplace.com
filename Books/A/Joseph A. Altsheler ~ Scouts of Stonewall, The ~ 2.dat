  Captain Sherburne told Captain McGee that the invaders were coming,   and there was a stir in the ranks of the defenders.  The cavalrymen,   disciplined and eager, said nothing, but merely moved a little in  order  to see better along the road over which the enemy was advancing.   The  original defenders, who were infantry, talked in whispers,  despite  commands, and exchanged doubts and apprehensions. 
  Harry walked up and down in front of the warehouse with Captain  Sherburne,  and both watched the road. 
  &#8220;If we only had a little artillery, just a light gun or two,&#8221; said   Sherburne, &#8220;we'd give 'em such a surprise that they'd never get over  it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But we haven't got it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, we haven't, but maybe rifles and carbines will serve.&#8221; 
  The hoofbeats were fast growing louder, and Harry knew that the  head of  the Northern column would appear in a minute or two.  Every  light in the  warehouse or about it and all in the village had been  extinguished,  but the moonlight was clear and more stars had come into  the full sky. 
  &#8220;We can see well enough for a fight,&#8221; murmured Captain Sherburne. 
  Everybody could hear the hoofbeats now, and again there was a stir  in the  ranks of the defenders.  The dark line appeared in the road  three or four  hundred yards away and then, as the horsemen emerged  into the open,  they deployed rapidly by companies.  They, too, were  trained men, and  keen eyes among their officers caught sight of the  armed dark line before  the warehouse.  The voice of the trumpet  suddenly pealed forth again,  and now it was loud and menacing. 
  &#8220;It's the charge!&#8221; cried Sherburne, &#8220;and I can see that they're all  you  said, Kenton!  A magnificent body, truly!  Ready, men!  Ready!   For God's  sake don't fire too soon!  Wait for the word!  Wait for the  word!&#8221; 
  He was all the leader now, and in the excitement of the moment  McGee  did not notice it.  The superior mind, the one keen to see and  to act,  was in control. 
  &#8220;Here, Kenton!&#8221; cried Sherburne, &#8220;hold back these recruits!  My own  men  will do exactly as I say!&#8221; 
  Harry ran along the infantry line, and here and there he knocked  down  rifles which were raised already, although the enemy was yet  three  hundred yards away. But he saw a figure in front of the charging  horsemen  wave a sword.  Then the trumpet blew another call, short but  fierce and  menacing, and the ground thundered as nearly a thousand  horsemen swept  forward, uttering a tremendous shout, their sabers  flashing in the  moonlight. 
  Harry felt a moment of admiration and then another moment of pity.   These men, charging so grandly, did not know that the defenders had  been  reinforced.  Nor did they know that they rode straight to what  was swift  and sudden death for many of them. 
  It was hard to stand steady and not pull the trigger, while that  line of  flashing steel galloped upon them, but the dismounted  cavalrymen looked  to their leader for commands, and the officer held  the infantry.  Harry's  moment of admiration and pity passed.  These  were soldiers coming to  defeat and destroy, and it was his business to  help prevent it.  His own  pulse of battle began to beat hard. 
  That front of steel, spread wide across the open, was within two  hundred  yards now!  Then a hundred and fifty!  Then a hundred!  Then  less,  and fierce and sharp like the crack of a rifle came Captain  Sherburne's  command: &#8220;Fire!&#8221; 
  Four hundred rifles leaped to the shoulder and four hundred fingers   pressed trigger so close together that four hundred rifles sang  together  as one.  The charge halted in its tracks.  The entire front  rank was shot  away.  Horses and men went down together, and the horses  uttered neighs  of pain, far more terrific than the groans of the  wounded men.  Many of  them, riderless, galloped up and down between  the lines. 
  But the splendid horsemen behind came on again, after the momentary  stop.  Half of them armed with short carbines sent a volley at the  defenders,  who were shoving in cartridges in frantic haste, and the  swordsmen  galloped straight upon the Virginians. 
  Harry saw a great saber flashing directly in his face.  It was  wielded by  a man on a powerful horse that seemed wild with the battle  fever.  The horse, at the moment, was more terrible than his rider.   His mouth  was dripping with foam, and his lips were curled back from  his cruel,  white teeth.  His eyes, large and shot with blood, were  like those of  some huge, carnivorous animal. 
  The boy recoiled, more in fear of the horse than of the saber, and   snatching a heavy pistol from his belt, fired directly at the great   foam-flecked head.  The horse crashed down, but his rider sprang clear   and retreated into the smoke.  Almost at the same instant the  defenders  had fired the second volley, and the charge was beaten back  from their  very faces. 
  The Southerners at the war's opening had the advantage of an almost   universal familiarity with the rifle, and now they used it well.   Sherburne's two hundred men, always cool and steady, fired like  trained  marksmen, and the others did almost as well.  Most of them had  new rifles,  using cartridges, and no cavalry on earth could stand  before such a fire. 
  Harry again saw the flashing sabers more than once, and there was a  vast  turmoil of fire and smoke in front of him, but in a few minutes  the  trumpet sounded again, loud and clear over the crash of battle,  and now  it was calling to the men to come back. 
  The two forces broke apart.  The horsemen, save for the wounded and  dead,  retreated to the forest, and the defenders, victorious for the  present,  fired no more, while the wounded, who could, crawled away to  shelter.  They reloaded their rifles and at first there was no  exultation.  They  barely had time to think of anything.  The impact  had been so terrible  and there had been such a blaze of firing that  they were yet in a daze,  and scarcely realized what had happened. 
  &#8220;Down, men!  Down!&#8221; cried Captain Sherburne, as he ran along the  line.  &#8220;They'll open fire from the wood!&#8221; 
  All the defenders threw themselves upon the ground and lay there,  much  less exposed and also concealed partly.  One edge of the wood ran  within  two hundred yards of the warehouse, and presently the Northern  soldiers,  hidden behind the trees at that point, opened a heavy rifle  fire.  Bullets whistled over the heads of the defenders, and kept up a  constant  patter upon the walls of the warehouse, but did little  damage. 
  A few of the men in gray had been killed, and all the wounded were  taken  inside the warehouse, into which the great tobacco barn had been  turned.  Two competent surgeons attended to them by the light of  candles, while  the garrison outside lay still and waiting under the  heavy fire. 
  &#8220;A waste of lead,&#8221; said Sherburne to Harry.  &#8220;They reckon, perhaps,   that we're all recruits, and will be frightened into retreat or   surrender.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If we had those guns now we could clear out the woods in short  order,&#8221;  said Harry. 
  &#8220;And if they had 'em they could soon blow up this barn, everything  in it  and a lot of us at the same time.  So we are more than even on  the matter  of the lack of guns.&#8221; 
  The fire from the wood died in about fifteen minutes and was  succeeded by  a long and trying silence.  The light of the moon  deepened, and silvered  the faces of the dead lying in the open.  All  the survivors of the attack  were hidden, but the defenders knew that  they were yet in the forest. 
  &#8220;Kenton,&#8221; said Captain Sherburne, &#8220;you know the way to General  Jackson's  camp at Winchester.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've been over it a dozen times.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then you must mount and ride.  This force is sitting down before  us for  a siege, and it probably has pickets about the village, but you  must get  through somehow.  Bring help!  The Yankees are likely to send  back for  help, too, but we've got to win here.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm off in five minutes,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;and I'll come with a  brigade by  dawn.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I believe you will,&#8221; said Sherburne.  &#8220;But get to Old Jack!  Get  there!  If you can only reach him, we're saved!  He may not have any  horsemen at  hand, but his foot cavalry can march nearly as fast!   Lord, how Stonewall  Jackson can cover ground!&#8221; 
  Their hands met in the hearty grasp of a friendship which was  already old  and firm, and Harry, without looking back, slipped into  the wood, where  the men from the village were watching over the  horses.  Sherburne had  told him to take any horse he needed, but he  chose his own, convinced  that he had no equal, slipped into the  saddle, and rode to the edge of  the wood. 
  &#8220;There's a creek just back of us; you can see the water shining  through  the break in the trees,&#8221; said a man who kept the village  store.  &#8220;The  timber's pretty thick along it, and you'd best keep in  its shelter.  Here, you Tom, show him the way.&#8221; 
  A boy of fourteen stepped up to the horse's head. 
  &#8220;My son,&#8221; said the storekeeper.  &#8220;He knows every inch of the  ground.&#8221; 
  But Harry waved him back. 
  &#8220;No,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I'll be shot at, and the boy on foot can't escape.   I'll find my way through.  No, I tell you he must not go!&#8221; 
  He almost pushed back the boy who was eager for the task, rode out  of the  wood which was on the slope of the hill away from the point of  attack,  and gained the fringe of timber along the creek.  It was about  fifty  yards from cover to cover, but he believed he had not been seen,  as  neither shout nor shot followed him. 
  Yet the Union pickets could not be far away.  He had seen enough to  know  that the besiegers were disciplined men led by able officers and  they  would certainly make a cordon about the whole Southern position. 
  He rode his horse into a dense clump of trees and paused to listen.   He heard nothing but the faint murmur of the creek, and the occasional   rustle of dry branches as puffs of wind passed.  He dismounted for the   sake of caution and silence as far as possible, and led his horse down   the fringe of trees, always keeping well under cover. 
  Another hundred yards and he stopped again to listen.  All those  old  inherited instincts and senses leaped into life.  He was, for the  moment,  the pioneer lad, seeking to detect the ambush of his foe.   Now, his acute  ears caught the hostile sound.  It was low, merely the  footsteps of a man,  steadily walking back and forth. 
  Harry peeped from his covert and saw a Union sentinel not far away,   pacing his beat, rifle on shoulder, the point of the bayonet tipped  with  silver flame from the moon.  And he saw further on another  sentinel,  and then another, all silent and watchful.  He knew that the  circle about  the defense was complete. 
  He could have escaped easily through the line, had he been willing  to  leave his horse, and for a few moments he was sorely tempted to do  so,  but he recalled that time was more precious than jewels.  If he  ever got  beyond the line of pickets he must go and go fast. 
  He was three or four hundred yards from the village and no one had  yet  observed him, but he did not believe that he could go much farther   undetected.  Some one was bound to hear the heavy footsteps of the  horse. 
  The creek shallowed presently and the banks became very low.  Then  Harry  decided suddenly upon his course.  He would put everything to  the touch  and win or lose in one wild dash.  Springing upon the back  of his horse,  he raked him with the spur and put him straight at the  creek.  The  startled animal was across in two jumps, and then Harry  sent him racing  across the fields.  He heard two or three shouts and  several shots,  but fortunately none touched him or his mount, and, not  looking back,  he continually urged the horse to greater speed. 
  Bending low he heard the distant sound of hoofbeats behind him, but  they  soon died away.  Then he entered a belt of forest, and when he  passed out  on the other side no pursuit could be seen.  But he did not  slacken  speed.  He knew that all Sherburne had said about Stonewall  Jackson was  true.  He would forgive no dallying by the way.  He  demanded of every man  his uttermost. 
  He turned from the unfenced field into the road, and rode at a full   gallop toward Winchester.  The cold wind swept past and his spirits  rose  high.  Every pulse was beating with exultation.  It was he who  had  brought the warning to the defenders of the stores.  It was he who  had  brought Sherburne's troop to help beat off the attack, and now it  was he  who, bursting through the ring of steel, was riding to Jackson  and sure  relief. 
  His horse seemed to share his triumph.  He ran on and on without a  swerve  or jar.  Once he stretched out his long head, and uttered a  shrill neigh.  The sound died in far echoes, and then followed only the  rapid beat of  his hoofs on the hard road. 
  Harry knew that there was no longer any danger to him from the  enemy,  and he resolved now not to go to his own colonel, but to ride  straight to  the tent of Jackson himself. 
  The night had never grown dark.  Moon and stars still shed an  abundant  light for the flying horseman, and presently he caught  fleeting glimpses  through the trees of roofs that belonged to  Winchester.  Then two men in  gray spring into the road, and, leveling  their rifles, gave him the  command to stop. 
  &#8220;I'm Lieutenant Kenton of the Invincibles,&#8221; he cried, &#8220;and I come  for  help.  A strong force of the Yankees is besieging Hertford, and  four  hundred of our men are defending it.  There is no time to waste!   They  must have help there before dawn, or everything is lost!  Which  way is  General Jackson's tent?&#8221; 
  &#8220;In that field on the hillock!&#8221; replied one of the men, pointing  two or  three hundred yards away. 
  Harry raced toward the tent, which rose in modest size out of the   darkness, and sprang to the ground, when his horse reached it.  A  single  sentinel, rifle across his arms, was standing before it, but  the flap was  thrown back and a light was burning inside. 
  &#8220;I'm a messenger for General Jackson!&#8221; cried Harry.  &#8220;I've news  that  can't wait!&#8221; 
  The sentinel hesitated a moment, but a figure within stepped to the  door  of the tent and Harry for the first time was face to face with  Stonewall  Jackson.  He had seen him often near or far, but now he  stood before him,  and was to speak with him. 
  Jackson was dressed fully and the fine wrinkles of thought showed  on his  brow, as if he had intended to study and plan the night  through.  He was  a tallish man, with good features cut clearly, high  brow, short brown  beard and ruddy complexion.  His uniform was quite  plain and his  appearance was not imposing, but his eyes of deep blue  regarded the boy  keenly. 
  &#8220;I'm Lieutenant Kenton, sir, of Colonel Talbot's Invincibles,&#8221;  replied  Harry to the question which was not spoken, but which  nevertheless was  asked.  &#8220;Our arsenal at Hertford is besieged by a  strong force of the  enemy, a force that is likely to be increased  heavily by dawn.  Luckily  Captain Sherburne and his troop of valley  Virginians came up in time to  help, and I have slipped through the  besieging lines to bring more aid.&#8221; 
  Harry had touched his cap as he spoke and now he stood in silence  while  the blue eyes looked him through. 
  &#8220;I know you.  I've observed you,&#8221; said Jackson in calm, even tones,   showing not a trace of excitement.  &#8220;I did not think that the Federal   troops would make a movement so soon, but we will meet it.  A brigade   will march in half an hour.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't I go with it?&#8221; exclaimed Harry pleadingly.  &#8220;You know, I  brought  the news, sir!&#8221; 
  &#8220;You do.  Your regiment will form part of the brigade.  Rejoin  Colonel  Talbot at once.  The Invincibles, with you as guide, shall  lead the way.  You have done well, Lieutenant Kenton.&#8221; 
  Harry flushed with pride at the brief words of praise, which meant  so  much coming from Stonewall Jackson, and saluting again hurried to  his  immediate command.  Already the messengers were flying to the  different  regiments, bidding them to be up and march at once. 
  The Invincibles were upon their feet in fifteen minutes, fully  clothed  and armed, and ready for the road.  The cavalry were not  available that  night, and the brigade would march on foot save for the  officers.  Harry was back on his horse, and St. Clair and Langdon were  beside him.  The colonels, Talbot and St. Hilaire, sat on their horses  at the head of  the Invincibles, the first regiment. 
  &#8220;What is it?&#8221; said Langdon to Harry.  &#8220;Have you brought this night  march  upon us?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have, and we're going to strike the Yankees before dawn at  Hertford,&#8221;  replied Harry to both questions. 
  &#8220;I like the nights for rest,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;but it could be worse;   I've had four hours' sleep anyway.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You'll have no more this night, that's certain,&#8221; said St. Clair.   &#8220;Look, General Jackson, himself, is going with us.  See him climbing  upon  Little Sorrel!  Lord pity the foot cavalry!&#8221; 
  General Jackson, mounted upon the sorrel horse destined to become  so  famous, rode to the head of the brigade, which was now in ranks,  and  beckoned to Harry. 
  &#8220;I've decided to attend to this affair myself, Lieutenant Kenton,&#8221;   he said.  &#8220;Keep by my side.  You know the way.  Be sure that you lead  us  right.&#8221; 
  His voice was not raised, but his words had an edge of steel.  The  cold  blue eyes swept him with a single chilly glance and Harry felt  the fear  of God in his soul.  Lead them right?  His faculties could  not fail with  Stonewall Jackson by his side. 
  The general himself gave the word, the brigade swung into the broad  road  and it marched.  It did not dawdle along.  It marched, and it  marched  fast.  It actually seemed to Harry after the first mile that  it was  running, running toward the enemy. 
  Not in vain had the infantry of Stonewall Jackson been called foot   cavalry.  Harry now for the first time saw men really march.  The road   spun behind them and the forest swept by.  They were nearly all  open-air  Virginians, long of limb, deep of chest and great of muscle.   There was  no time for whispering among them, and the exchange of  guesses about  their destination.  They needed every particle of air in  their lungs for  the terrible man who made them march as men had seldom  marched before. 
  Jackson cast a grim eye on the long files that sank away in the  darkness  behind him. 
  &#8220;They march very well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but they will do better with more   practice.  Ride to the rear, Lieutenant Kenton, and see if there are  any  stragglers.  If you find any order them back into line and if they  refuse  to obey, shoot.&#8221; 
  Again his voice was not raised, but an electric current of fiery  energy  seemed to leap from this grave, somber man and to infuse itself  through  the veins of the lad to whom he gave the orders. 
  Harry saluted and, wheeling his horse, rode swiftly along the edge  of the  forest toward the rear.  Now, the spirit of indomitable youth  broke  forth.  Many in the columns were as young as he and some  younger.  In the earlier years of the war, and indeed, to the very  close, there was  little outward respect for rank among the citizen  soldiers of either  army.  Harry was saluted with a running fire of  chaff. 
  &#8220;Turn your horse's head, young feller, the enemy ain't that way.   He's in front.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He's forgot his toothbrush, Bill, and he's going back in a hurry  to get  it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If I had a horse like that I'd ride him in the right direction.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Tell 'em in Winchester that the foot cavalry are marchin' a  hundred  miles an hour.&#8221; 
  Harry did not resent these comments.  He merely flung back an  occasional  comment of his own and hurried on until he reached the  rear.  Then in the  dusk of the road he found four or five men limping  along, and ready when  convenient to drop away in the darkness.  Harry  wasted no time.  The fire  in his blood that had come from Jackson was  still burning.  He snatched a  pistol from his belt and, riding  directly at them, cried: 
  &#8220;Forward and into the ranks at once, or I shoot!&#8221; 
  &#8220;But we are lame, sir!&#8221; cried one of the men.  &#8220;See my foot is  bleeding!&#8221; 
  He held up one foot and red drops were falling from the ragged  shoe. 
  &#8220;It makes no difference,&#8221; cried Harry.  &#8220;Barefooted men should be  glad to  march for Stonewall Jackson!  One, two, three!  Hurry, all of  you,  or I shoot!&#8221; 
  The men took one look at the flaming face, and broke into a run for  the  rear guard.  Harry saw them in the ranks and then beat up the  woods on  either side of the road, but saw no more stragglers or  deserters.  Then he galloped through the edge of the forest and  rejoined the general  at the head of the command. 
  &#8220;Were they all marching?&#8221; asked Jackson. 
  &#8220;All but four, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And the four?&#8221; 
  &#8220;They're marching now, too.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Good.  How far are we from the arsenal?&#8221; 
  &#8220;About eight miles, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Isn't it nearer nine?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should say nearer eight, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You should know, and at any rate we'll soon see.&#8221; 
  Jackson did not speak to him again directly, evidently keeping him  at his  side now for sure guidance, but he continually sent other aides  along the  long lines to urge more speed.  The men were panting, and,  despite the  cold of the winter night, beads of perspiration stood on  every face.  But Jackson was pitiless.  He continually spurred them on,  and now Harry  knew with the certainty of fate that he would get there  in time.  He  would reach Hertford before fresh Union troops could  come.  He was as  infallible as fate. 
  There was no breath left for whispering in the ranks of Jackson's  men.  Nothing was heard but the steady beat of marching feet, and now  and then,  the low command of an officer.  But such commands were few.   There were  no more stragglers, and the chief himself rode at their  head.  They knew  how to follow. 
  The moon faded and many of the stars went back into infinite space.   A dusky film was drawn across the sky, and at a distance the fields  and  forest blended into one great shadow.  Harry looked back at the  brigade  which wound in a long dark coil among the trees.  He could not  see faces  of the men now, only the sinuous black shape of illimitable  length that  their solid lines made. 
  This long black shape moved fast, and occasionally it gave forth a   sinister glitter, as stray moonbeams fell upon blade or bayonet.  It   seemed to Harry that there was something deadly and inevitable about  it,  and he began to feel sorry for the Union troops who were besieging  the  village and who did not know that Stonewall Jackson was coming. 
  He cast a sidelong glance at the leader.  He rode, leaning a little   further forward in the saddle than usual, and the wintry blue eyes  gazed  steadily before him.  Harry knew that they missed nothing. 
  &#8220;You are sure that we are on the right road, Mr. Kenton?&#8221; said  Jackson. 
  &#8220;Quite sure of it, sir.&#8221; 
  The general did not speak again for some time.  Then, when he  caught the  faint glimmer of water through the dark, he said: 
  &#8220;This is the creek, is it not?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir, and the Yankees can't be more than a mile away.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And it's a full hour until dawn.  The reinforcements for the enemy   cannot have come up.  Lieutenant Kenton, I wish you to stay with me.   I will have a messenger tell Colonel Talbot that for the present you  are  detached for my service.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I wish to see how you crumple up the enemy.&#8221; 
  The cold blue eyes gleamed for a moment.  Harry more than guessed  the  depths of passion and resolve that lay behind the impenetrable  mask of  Jackson's face.  He felt again the rays of the white, hot fire  that  burned in the great Virginian's soul. 
  A few hundred yards further and the brigade began to spread out in  the  dusk.  Companies filed off to right and left, and in a few minutes  came  shots from the pickets, sounding wonderfully clear and sharp in  the  stillness of the night.  Red dots from the rifle muzzles appeared  here  and there in the woods, and then Harry caught the glint of late  starshine  on the eaves of the warehouse. 
  Jackson drew his horse a little to one side of the road, and Harry,   obedient to orders, followed him.  A regiment massed directly behind  them  drew up close.  Harry saw that it was his own Invincibles.  There  were  Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire  on  horseback, looking very proud and eager.  Further away were Langdon  and  St. Clair also mounted, but Harry could not see the expression on  their  faces. 
  &#8220;Tell Colonel Talbot to have the charge sounded and then to attack  with  all his might,&#8221; said Jackson to his young aide. 
  Harry carried the order eagerly and rejoined the general at once.   The drums of the Invincibles beat the charge, and on both sides of  them  the drums of other regiments played the same tune.  Then the  drum-beat  was lost in that wild and thrilling shout, the rebel yell,  more terrible  than the war-whoop of the Indians, and the whole brigade  rushed forward  in a vast half-circle that enclosed the village between  the two horns of  the curve. 
  The scattered firing of the pickets was lost in the great shout of  the  South, and, by the time the Northern sentinels could give the  alarm to  their main body, the rush of Jackson's men was upon them,  clearing out  the woods and fields in a few instants and driving the  Union horsemen in  swift flight northward. 
  Harry kept close to his general.  He saw a spark of fire shoot from  the  blue eye, and the nostrils expand.  Then the mask became as  impenetrable  as ever.  He let the reins fall on the neck of Little  Sorrel, and watched  his men as they swept into the open, passed the  warehouse, and followed  the enemy into the forest beyond. 
  But the bugles quickly sounded the recall.  It was not Jackson's  purpose  to waste his men in frays which could produce little.  The  pursuing  regiments returned reluctantly to the open where the  inhabitants of the  village were welcoming Jackson with great  rejoicings.  The encounter had  been too swift and short to cause great  loss, but all the stores were  saved and Captain Sherburne and Captain  McGee rode forward to salute  their commander. 
  &#8220;You made a good defense,&#8221; said Stonewall Jackson, crisply and  briefly.  &#8220;We begin the removal of the stores at once.  Wagons will  come up shortly  for that purpose.  Take your cavalry, Captain  Sherburne, and scout the  country.  If they need sleep they can get it  later when there is nothing  else to do.&#8221; 
  Captain Sherburne saluted and Harry saw his face flush with pride.   The indomitable spirit of Jackson was communicated fast to all his  men.  The sentence to more work appealed to Sherburne with much greater  force  than the sentence of rest could have done.  In a moment he and  his men  were off, searching the woods and fields in the direction of  the Union  camp. 
  &#8220;Ride back on the road, Lieutenant Kenton, and tell the wagons to  hurry,&#8221;  said General Jackson to Harry.  &#8220;Before I left Winchester I  gave orders  for them to follow, and we must not waste time here.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Harry, as he turned and rode into the forest  through  which they had come.  He, too, felt the same emotion that had  made the  face of Sherburne flush with pride.  What were sleep and rest  to a young  soldier, following a man who carried victory in the hollow  of his hand;  not the victory of luck or chance, but the victory of  forethought,  of minute preparation, and of courage. 
  He galloped fast, and the hard road gave back the ring of steel  shod  hoofs.  A silver streak showed in the eastern sky.  The dawn was   breaking.  He increased his pace.  The woods and fields fled by.  Then  he heard the cracking of whips, and the sound of voices urging  on  reluctant animals.  Another minute and the long line of wagons  was in  sight straining along the road. 
  &#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; cried Harry to the leader who drove, bareheaded. 
  &#8220;Has Old Jack finished the job?&#8221; asked the man. 
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;How long did it take him?&#8221; 
  &#8220;About five minutes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I win,&#8221; called the man to the second driver just behind him.  &#8220;You   'lowed it would take him ten minutes, but I said not more'n seven at  the  very furthest.&#8221; 
  The train broke into a trot, and Harry, turning his horse, rode by  the  side of the leader. 
  &#8220;How did you know that it would take General Jackson so little time  to  scatter the enemy?&#8221; the boy asked the man. 
  &#8220;'Cause I know Old Jack.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But he has not yet done much in independent command.&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, but I've seen him gettin' ready, an' I've watched him.  He  sees  everything, an' he prays.  I tell you he prays.  I ain't a  prayin' man  myself.  But when a man kneels down in the bushes an'  talks humble an'  respectful to his God, an' then rises up an' jumps at  the enemy, it's  time for that enemy to run.  I'd rather be attacked by  the worst bully  and desperado that ever lived than by a prayin' man.   You see, I want to  live, an' what chance have I got ag'in a man  that's not only not afraid  to die, but that's willin' to die, an'  rather glad to die, knowin' that  he's goin' straight to Heaven an'  eternal joy?  I tell you, young man,  that unbelievers ain't ever got  any chance against believers; no, not in  nothin'.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I believe you're right.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Right!  Of course I'm right!  Why did Old Jack order these waggins  to  come along an' get them stores?  'Cause he believed he was goin' to  save  'em.  An' mebbe he saved 'em, 'cause he believed he was goin' to  do it.  It works both ways.  Git up!&#8221; 
  The shout of &#8220;Git up!&#8221; was to his horses, which added a little more  to  their pace, and now Harry saw troops coming back to meet them and  form an  escort. 
  In half an hour they were at the village.  Already the ammunition  and  supplies had been brought forth and were stacked, ready to be  loaded on  the wagons.  General Jackson was everywhere, riding back and  forth on his  sorrel horse, directing the removal just as he had  directed the march and  the brief combat.  His words were brief but  always dynamic.  He seemed  insensible to weariness. 
  It was now full morning, wintry and clear.  The small population of  the  village and people from the surrounding country, intensely  Southern and  surcharged with enthusiasm, were bringing hot coffee and  hot breakfast  for the troops.  Jackson permitted them to eat and drink  in relays.  As many as could get at the task helped to load the wagons.   Little  compulsion was needed.  Officers themselves toiled at boxes  and casks.  The spirit of Jackson had flowed into them all. 
  &#8220;I've gone into training,&#8221; said Langdon to Harry. 
  &#8220;Training?  What kind of training, Tom?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I see that my days of play are over forever, and I'm practicing  hard,  so I can learn how to do without food, sleep or rest for months  at a  time.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's well you're training,&#8221; interrupted St. Clair.  &#8220;I foresee  that  you're going to need all the practice you can get.  Everything's  loaded  in the wagons now, and I wager you my chances of promotion  against one of  our new Confederate dollar bills that we start inside  of a minute.&#8221; 
  The word &#8220;minute&#8221; was scarcely out of his mouth, when Jackson gave  the  sharp order to march.  Sherburne's troop sprang to saddle and led  the way,  their bugler blowing a mellow salute to the morning and  victory.  Many  whips cracked, and the wagons bearing the precious  stores swung into  line.  Behind came the brigade, the foot cavalry.   The breakfast and the  loading of the wagons had not occupied more  than half an hour.  It was  yet early morning when the whole force left  the village and marched at a  swift pace toward Winchester. 
  General Jackson beckoned to Harry. 
  &#8220;Ride with me,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I've notified Colonel Talbot that you  are  detached from his staff and will serve on mine.&#8221; 
  Although loath to leave his comrades Harry appreciated the favor  and  flushed with pleasure. 
  &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; he said briefly. 
  Jackson nodded.  He seemed to like the lack of effusive words.   Harry  knew that his general had not tasted food.  Neither had he.  He  had  actually forgotten it in his keenness for his work, and now he was  proud  of the fact.  He was proud, too, of the comradeship of  abstention that it  gave him with Stonewall Jackson.  As he rode in  silence by the side of  the great commander he made for himself an  ideal.  He would strive in his  own youthful way to show the zeal, the  courage and the untiring devotion  that marked the general. 
  The sun, wintry but golden, rose higher and made fields and forest   luminous.  But few among Jackson's men had time to notice the glory of   the morning.  It seemed to Harry that they were marching back almost  as  swiftly as they had come.  Langdon was right and more.  They were  getting  continuous practice not only in the art of living without  food, sleep or  rest, but also of going everywhere on a run instead of  a walk.  Those who  survived it would be incomparable soldiers. 
  Winchester appeared and the people came forth rejoicing.  Jackson  gave  orders for the disposition of the stores and then rode at once to  a tent.  He signalled to Harry also to dismount and enter.  An orderly  took the  horses of both. 
  &#8220;Sit down at the table there,&#8221; said Jackson.  &#8220;I want to dictate to  you  some orders.&#8221; 
  Harry sat down.  He had forgotten to take off his cap and gloves,  but he  removed one gauntlet now, and picked up a pen which lay beside  a little  inkstand, a pad of coarse paper on the other side. 
  Jackson himself had not removed hat or gauntlets either, and the  heavy  cavalry cloak that he had worn on the ride remained flung over  his  shoulders.  He dictated a brief order to his brigadiers, Loring,  Edward  Johnson, Garnett, the commander of the Stonewall Brigade, and  Ashby,  who led the cavalry, to prepare for a campaign and to see that  everything  was ready for a march in the morning. 
  Harry made copies of all the orders and sealed them. 
  &#8220;Deliver every one to the man to whom it is addressed,&#8221; said  Jackson,  &#8220;and then report to me.  But be sure that you say nothing of  their  contents to anybody.&#8221; 
  The boy, still burning with zeal, hurried forth with the orders,   delivered them all, and came back to the tent, where he found the  general  dictating to another aide.  Jackson glanced at him and Harry,  saluting,  said: 
  &#8220;I have given all the orders, sir, to those for whom they were  intended.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very well,&#8221; said Jackson.  &#8220;Wait and I shall have more messages  for you  to carry.&#8221; 
  He turned to the second aide, but seeming to remember something,  looked  at his watch. 
  &#8220;Have you had any breakfast, Mr. Kenton?&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;No, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Any sleep?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;When?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I slept well, sir, night before last.&#8221; 
  Harry's reply was given in all seriousness.  Jackson smiled.  The  boy's  reply and his grave manner pleased him. 
  &#8220;I won't give you any more orders just now,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Go out and  get  something to eat, but do not be gone longer than half an hour.   You need  sleep, too&#8212;but that can wait.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I shall be glad to carry your orders, sir, now.  The food can  wait, too.  I am not hungry.&#8221; 
  Harry spoke respectfully.  There was in truth an appealing note in  his  voice.  Jackson gave him another and most searching glance. 
  &#8220;I think I chose well when I chose you,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;But go, get  your  breakfast.  It is not necessary to starve to death now.  We may  have a  chance at that later.&#8221; 
  The faintest twinkle of grim humor appeared in his eyes and Harry,   withdrawing, hastened at once to the Invincibles, where he knew he  would  have food and welcome in plenty. 
  St. Clair and Langdon greeted him with warmth and tried to learn  from him  what was on foot. 
  &#8220;There's a great bustle,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;and I know something big  is  ahead.  This is the last day of the Old Year, and I know that the  New  Year is going to open badly.  I'll bet you anything that before  tomorrow  morning is an hour old this whole army will be running  hot-foot over the  country, more afraid of Stonewall Jackson than of  fifty thousand of the  enemy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But you've been in training for it,&#8221; said Harry with a laugh. 
  &#8220;So I have, but I don't want to train too hard.&#8221; 
  Harry ate and drank and was back at General Jackson's tent in  twenty  minutes.  He had received a half hour but he was learning  already to do  better than was expected of him.
