  For a moment after the swift passing of the sledge it was on  Howland's lips to shout Croisset's name; as he thrust Gregson aside and  leaped out into the night he was impelled with a desire to give chase,  to overtake in some way the two people who, within the space of  forty-eight hours, had become so mysteriously associated with his own  life, and who were now escaping him again.
  It was Gregson who recalled him to his senses.
  &#8220;I thought you didn't care for theaters&#8212;<I>and girls</I>, Howland,&#8221;  he exclaimed banteringly, repeating Howland's words of a few minutes  before. &#8220;A pretty face affects you a little differently up here, eh?  Well, after you've been in this fag-end of the universe for a month or  so you'll learn&#8212;&#8221;
  Howland interrupted him sharply.
  &#8220;Did you ever see either of them before, Gregson?&#8221;
  &#8220;Never until to-day. But there's hope, old man. Surely we can find  some one in the place who knows them. Wouldn't it be jolly good fun if  Jack Howland, Esquire, who has never been interested in theaters and  girls, should come up into these God-forsaken regions and develop a  case of love at first sight? By the Great North Trail, I tell you it  may not be as uninteresting for you as it has been for Thorne and me!  If I had only seen her sooner&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Shut up!&#8221; growled Howland, betraying irritability for the first  time. &#8220;Let's go in to supper.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good. And I move that we investigate these people while we are  smoking our after-supper cigars. It will pass our time away, at least.&#8221;
  &#8220;Your taste is good, Gregson,&#8221; said Howland, recovering his  good-humor as they seated themselves at one of the rough board tables  in the dining-room. Inwardly he was convinced it would be best to keep  to himself the incidents of the past two days and nights. &#8220;It was a  beautiful face.&#8221;
  &#8220;And the eyes!&#8221; added Gregson, his own gleaming with enthusiasm.  &#8220;She looked at me squarely this afternoon when she and that dark fellow  passed, and I swear they're the most beautiful eyes I ever saw. And her  hair&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you think that she knew you?&#8221; asked Howland quietly.
  Gregson hunched his shoulders.
  &#8220;How the deuce could she know me?&#8221;
  &#8220;Then why did she look at you so 'squarely?' Trying to flirt, do you  suppose?&#8221;
  Surprise shot into Gregson's face.
  &#8220;By thunder, no, she wasn't flirting!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;I'd stake my  life on that. A man never got a clearer, more sinless look than she  gave me, and yet&#8212;Why, deuce take it, she<I> stared</I> at me! I didn't  see her again after that, but the dark fellow was in here half of the  afternoon, and now that I come to think of it he did show some interest  in me. Why do you ask?&#8221;
  &#8220;Just curiosity,&#8221; replied Howland, &#8220;I don't like flirts.&#8221;
  &#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; said Gregson musingly. Their supper came on and they  conversed but little until its end. Howland had watched his companion  closely and was satisfied that he knew nothing of Croisset or the girl.  The fact puzzled him more than ever. How Gregson and Thorne, two of the  best engineers in the country, could voluntarily surrender a task like  the building of the Hudson Bay Railroad simply because they were &#8220;tired  of the country&#8221; was more than he could understand.
  It was not until they were about to leave the table that Howland's  eyes accidentally fell on Gregson's left hand. He gave an exclamation  of astonishment when he saw that the little finger was missing. Gregson  jerked the hand to his side.
  &#8220;A little accident,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;You'll meet 'em up here,  Howland.&#8221;
  Before he could move, the young engineer had caught his arm and was  looking closely at the hand.
  &#8220;A curious wound,&#8221; he remarked, without looking up. &#8220;Funny I didn't  notice it before. Your finger was cut off lengthwise, and here's the  scar running half way to your wrist. How did you do it?&#8221;
  He dropped the hand in time to see a nervous flush in the other's  face.
  &#8220;Why&#8212;er&#8212;fact is, Howland, it was shot off several months ago&#8212;in  an accident, of course.&#8221; He hurried through the door, continuing to  speak over his shoulder as he went, &#8220;Now for those after-supper cigars  and our investigation.&#8221;
  As they passed from the dining-room into that part of the inn which  was half bar and half lounging-room, already filled with smoke and a  dozen or so picturesque citizens of Le Pas, the rough-jowled proprietor  of the place motioned to Howland and held out a letter.
  &#8220;This came while you was at supper, Mr. Howland,&#8221; he explained.
  The engineer gave an inward start when he saw the writing on the  envelope, and as he tore it open he turned so that Gregson could see  neither his face nor the slip of paper which he drew forth. There was  no name at the bottom of what he read. It was not necessary, for a  glance had told him that the writing was that of the girl whose face he  had seen again that night; and her words to him this time, despite his  caution, drew a low whistle from his lips.
  &#8220;Forgive me for what I have done,&#8221; the note ran. &#8220;Believe me now.  Your life is in danger and you must go back to Etomami to-morrow. If  you go to the Wekusko camp you will not live to come back.&#8221;
  &#8220;The devil!&#8221; he exclaimed.
  &#8220;What's that?&#8221; asked Gregson, edging around him curiously.
  Howland crushed the note in his hand and thrust it into one of his  pockets.
  &#8220;A little private affair,&#8221; he laughed. &#8220;Comes Gregson, let's see  what we can discover.&#8221;
  In the gloom outside one of his hands slipped under his coat and  rested on the butt of his revolver. Until ten o'clock they mixed  casually among the populace of Le Pas. Half a hundred people had seen  Croisset and his beautiful companion, but no one knew anything about  them. They had come that forenoon on a sledge, had eaten their dinner  and supper at the cabin of a Scotch tie-cutter named MacDonald, and had  left on a sledge.
  &#8220;She was the sweetest thing I ever saw,&#8221; exclaimed Mrs. MacDonald  rapturously. &#8220;Only she couldn't talk. Two or three times she wrote  things to me on a slip of paper.&#8221;
  &#8220;Couldn't talk!&#8221; repeated Gregson, as the two men walked leisurely  back to the boarding-house. &#8220;What the deuce do you suppose that means,  Jack?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm not supposing,&#8221; replied Howland indifferently. &#8220;We've had  enough of this pretty face, Gregson. I'm going to bed. What time do we  start in the morning?&#8221;
  &#8220;As soon as we've had breakfast&#8212;if you're anxious.&#8221;
  &#8220;I am. Good night.&#8221;
  Howland went to his room, but it was not to sleep. For hours he sat  wide-awake, smoking cigar after cigar, and thinking. One by one he went  over the bewildering incidents of the past two days. At first they had  stirred his blood with a certain exhilaration&#8212;a spice of excitement  which was not at all unpleasant; but with this excitement there was now  a peculiar sense of oppression. The attempt that had already been made  on his life together with the persistent warnings for him to return  into the South began to have their effect. But Howland was not a man to  surrender to his fears, if they could be called fears. He was satisfied  that a mysterious peril of some kind awaited him at the camp on the  Wekusko, but he gave up trying to fathom the reason for this peril,  accepting in his businesslike way the fact that it did exist, and that  in a short time it would probably explain itself. The one puzzling  factor which he could not drive out of his thoughts was the girl. Her  sweet face haunted him. At every turn he saw it&#8212;now over the table in  the opium den, now in the white starlight of the trail, again as it had  looked at him for an instant from the sledge. Vainly he strove to  discover for himself the lurking of sin in the pure eyes that had  seemed to plead for his friendship, in the soft lips that had lied to  him because of their silence. &#8220;Please forgive me for what I have  done&#8212;&#8221; He unfolded the crumpled note and read the words again and  again. &#8220;Believe me now&#8212;&#8221; She knew that he knew that she had lied to  him, that she had lured him into the danger from which she now wished  to save him. His cheeks burned. If a thousand perils threatened him on  the Wekusko he would still go. He would meet the girl again. Despite  his strongest efforts he found it impossible to destroy the vision of  her beautiful face. The eyes, soft with appeal; the red mouth,  quivering, and with lips parted as if about to speak to him; the head  as he had looked down on it with its glory of shining hair&#8212;all had  burned themselves on his soul in a picture too deep to be eradicated.  If the wilderness was interesting to him before it was doubly so now  because that face was a part of it, because the secret of its life, of  the misery that it had half confessed to him, was hidden somewhere out  in the black mystery of the spruce and balsam forests.
  He went to bed, but it was a long time before he fell asleep. It  seemed to him that he had scarcely closed his eyes when a pounding on  the door aroused him and he awoke to find the early light of dawn  creeping through the narrow window of his room. A few minutes later he  joined Gregson, who was ready for breakfast.
  &#8220;The sledge and dogs are waiting,&#8221; he greeted. As they seated  themselves at the table he added, &#8220;I've changed my mind since last  night, Howland. I'm not going back with you. It's absolutely  unnecessary, for Thorne can put you on to everything at the camp, and  I'd rather lose six months' salary than take that sledge ride again.  You won't mind, will you?&#8221;
  Howland hunched his shoulders.
  &#8220;To be honest, Gregson, I don't believe you'd be particularly  cheerful company. What sort of fellow is the driver?&#8221;
  &#8220;We call him Jackpine&#8212;a Cree Indian&#8212;and he's the one faithful  slave of Thorne and myself at Wekusko. Hunts for us, cooks for us, and  watches after things generally. You'll like him all right.&#8221;
  Howland did. When they went out to the sledge after their breakfast  he gave Jackpine a hearty grip of the hand and the Cree's dark face  lighted up with something like pleasure when he saw the enthusiasm in  the young engineer's eyes. When the moment for parting came Gregson  pulled his companion a little to one side. His eyes shifted nervously  and Howland saw that he was making a strong effort to assume an  indifference which was not at all Gregson's natural self.
  &#8220;Just a word, Howland,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know this is a pretty rough  country up here&#8212;some tough people in it, who wouldn't mind cutting a  man's throat or sending a bullet through him for a good team of dogs  and a rifle. I'm just telling you this so you'll be on your guard. Have  Jackpine watch your camp nights.&#8221;
  He spoke in a low voice and cut himself short when the Indian  approached. Howland seated himself in the middle of the six-foot  toboggan, waved his hand to Gregson, then with a wild halloo and a  snapping of his long caribou-gut whip Jackpine started his dogs on a  trot down the street, running close beside the sledge. Howland had  lighted a cigar, and leaning back in a soft mass of furs began to enjoy  his new experience hugely. Day was just fairly breaking over the  forests when they turned into the white trail, already beaten hard by  the passing of many dogs and sledges, that led from Le Pas for a  hundred miles to the camp on the Wekusko. As they struck the trail the  dogs strained harder at their traces, with Jackpine's whip curling and  snapping over their backs until they were leaping swiftly and with  unbroken rhythm of motion over the snow. Then the Cree gathered in his  whip and ran close to the leader's flank, his moccasined feet taking  the short, quick, light steps of the trained forest runner, his chest  thrown a little out, his eyes on the twisting trail ahead. It was a  glorious ride, and in the exhilaration of it Howland forgot to smoke  the cigar that he held between his fingers. His blood thrilled to the  tireless effort of the grayish-yellow pack of magnificent brutes ahead  of him; he watched the muscular play of their backs and legs, the eager  out-reaching of their wolfish heads, their half-gaping jaws, and from  them he looked at Jackpine. There was no effort in his running. His  black hair swept back from the gray of his cap; like the dogs there was  music in his movement, the beauty of strength, of endurance, of manhood  born to the forests, and when the dogs finally stopped at the foot of a  huge ridge, panting and half exhausted, Howland quickly leaped from the  sledge and for the first time spoke to the Indian.
  &#8220;That was glorious, Jackpine!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;But, good Lord, man,  you'll kill the dogs!&#8221;
  Jackpine grinned.
  &#8220;They go sixt' mile in day lak dat,&#8221; He grinned.
  &#8220;Sixty miles!&#8221;
  In his admiration for the wolfish looking beasts that were carrying  him through the wilderness Howland put out a hand to stroke one of them  on the head. With a warning cry the Indian jerked him back just as the  dog snapped fiercely at the extended hand.
  &#8220;No touch huskie!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;Heem half wolf&#8212;half dog&#8212;work  hard but no lak to be touch!&#8221;
  &#8220;Wow!&#8221; exclaimed Howland. &#8220;And they're the sweetest looking pups I  ever laid eyes on. I'm certainly running up against some strange things  in this country!&#8221;
  He was dead tired when night came. And yet never in all his life had  he enjoyed a day so much as this one. Twenty times he had joined  Jackpine in running beside the sledge. In their intervals of rest he  had even learned to snap the thirty-foot caribou-gut lash of the  dog-whip. He had asked a hundred questions, had insisted on Jackpine's  smoking a cigar at every stop, and had been so happy and so altogether  companionable that half of the Cree's hereditary reticence had been  swept away before his unbounded enthusiasm. He helped to build their  balsam shelter for the night, ate a huge supper of moose meat,  hot-stone biscuits, beans and coffee, and then, just as he had  stretched himself out in his furs for the night, he remembered  Gregson's warning. He sat up and called to Jackpine, who was putting a  fresh log on the big fire in front of the shelter.
  &#8220;Gregson told me to be sure and have the camp guarded at night,  Jackpine. What do you think about it?&#8221;
  The Indian turned with a queer chuckles his lathery face wrinkled in  a grin.
  &#8220;Gregson&#8212;heem ver' much 'fraid,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;No bad man here&#8212;all  down there and in camp. We kep' watch evr' night. Heem 'fraid&#8212;I guess  so, mebby.&#8221;
  &#8220;Afraid of what?&#8221;
  For a moment Jackpine was silent, half bending over the fire. Then  he held out his left hand, with the little finger doubled out of sight,  and pointed to it with his other hand.
  &#8220;Mebby heem finger ax'dent&#8212;mebby not,&#8221; he said.
  A dozen eager questions brought no further suggestions from  Jackpine. In fact, no sooner had the words fallen from his driver's  lips than Howland saw that the Indian was sorry he had spoken them.  What he had said strengthened the conviction which was slowly growing  within him. He had wondered at Gregson's strange demeanor, his evident  anxiety to get out of the country, and lastly at his desire not to  return to the camp on the Wekusko with him. There was but one solution  that came to him. In some way which he could not fathom Gregson was  associated with the mystery which enveloped him, and adding the senior  engineer's nervousness to the significance of Jackpine's words he was  confident that the missing finger had become a factor in the enigma.  How should he find Thorne? Surely he would give him an explanation&#8212;if  there was an explanation to give. Or was it possible that they would  leave him without warning to face a situation which was driving them  back to civilization?
  He went to sleep, giving no further thought to the guarding of the  camp. A piping hot breakfast was ready when Jackpine awakened him, and  once more the exhilarating excitement of their swift race through the  forests relieved him of the uncomfortable mental tension under which he  began to find himself. During the whole of the day Jackpine urged the  dogs almost to the limit of their endurance, and early in the afternoon  assured his companion that they would reach the Wekusko by nightfall.  It was already dark when they came out of the forest into a broad  stretch of cutting beyond which Howland caught the glimmer of scattered  lights. At the farther edge of the clearing the Cree brought his dogs  to a halt close to a large log-built cabin half sheltered among the  trees. It was situated several hundred yards from the nearest of the  lights ahead, and the unbroken snow about it showed that it had not  been used as a habitation for some time. Jackpine drew a key from his  pocket and without a word unlocked and swung open the heavy door.
  Damp, cold air swept into the faces of the two as they stood for a  moment peering into the gloom. Howland could hear the Cree chuckling in  his inimitable way as he struck a match, and as a big hanging oil lamp  flared slowly into light he turned a grinning face to the engineer.
  &#8220;Gregson um Thorne&#8212;heem mak' thees cabin when first kam to camp,&#8221;  he said softly. &#8220;No be near much noise&#8212;fine place in woods where be  quiet nights. Live here time&#8212;then Gregson um Thorne go live in camp.  Say too far 'way from man. But that not so. Thorne 'fraid&#8212;Gregson  'fraid&#8212;&#8221;
  He hunched his shoulders again as he opened the door of the big box  stove which stood in the room.
  Howland asked no questions, but stared about him. Everywhere he saw  evidences of the taste and one-time tenancies of the two senior  engineers. Heavy bear rugs lay on the board floor; the log walls, hewn  almost to polished smoothness, were hung with half a dozen pictures; in  one corner was a bookcase still filled with books, in another a lounge  covered with furs, and in this side of the room was a door which  Howland supposed must open into the sleeping apartment. A fire was  roaring in the big stove before he finished his inspection and as he  squared his shivering back to the heat he pulled out his pipe and  smiled cheerfully at Jackpine.
  &#8220;Afraid, eh? And am I to stay here?&#8221;
  &#8220;Gregson um Thorne say yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, Jackpine, you just hustle over to the camp and tell Thorne  I'm here, will you?&#8221;
  For a moment the Indian hesitated, then went out and closed the door  after him.
  &#8220;Afraid!&#8221; exclaimed Howland when he had gone. &#8220;Now what the devil  are they afraid of? It's deuced queer, Gregson&#8212;and ditto, Thorne. If  you're not the cowards I'm half believing you to be you won't leave me  in the dark to face something from which you are running away.&#8221;
  He lighted a small lamp and opened the door leading into the other  room. It was, as he had surmised, the sleeping chamber. The bed, a  single chair and a mirror and stand were its sole furnishing.
  Returning to the larger room, he threw off his coat and hat and  seated himself comfortably before the fire. Ten minutes later the door  opened again and Jackpine entered. He was supporting another figure by  the arm, and as Howland stared into the bloodless face of the man who  came with him, he could not repress the exclamation of astonishment  which rose to his lips. Three months before he had last seen Thorne in  Chicago; a man in the prime of life, powerfully built, as straight as a  tree, the most efficient and highest paid man in the company's employ.  How often had he envied Thorne! For years he had been his ideal of a  great engineer. And now&#8212;
  He stood speechless. Slowly, as if the movement gave him pain,  Thorne slipped off the great fur coat from about his shoulders. One of  his arms was suspended in a sling. His huge shoulders were bent, his  eyes wild and haggard. The smile that came to his lips as he held out a  hand to Howland gave to his death-white face an appearance even more  ghastly.
  &#8220;Hello, Jack!&#8221; he greeted. &#8220;What's the matter, man? Do I look like a  ghost?&#8221;
  &#8220;What is the matter, Thorne? I found Gregson half dying at Le Pas,  and now you&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;It's a wonder you're not reading my name on a little board slab  instead of seeing yours truly in flesh and blood, Jack,&#8221; laughed Thorne  nervously. &#8220;A ton of rock, man&#8212;a ton of rock, and I was under it!&#8221;
  Over Thorne's shoulder the young engineer caught a glimpse of the  Cree's face. A dark flash had shot into his eyes. His teeth gleamed for  an instant between his tense lips in something that might have been a  sneer.
  Thorne sat down, rubbing his hands before the fire.
  &#8220;We've been unfortunate, Jack,&#8221; he said slowly. &#8220;Gregson and I have  had the worst kind of luck since the day we struck this camp, and we're  no longer fit for the job. It will take us six months to get on our  feet again. You'll find everything here in good condition. The line is  blazed straight to the bay; we've got three hundred good men, plenty of  supplies, and so far as I know you'll not find a disaffected hand on  the Wekusko. Probably Gregson and I will take hold of the Le Pas end of  the line in the spring. It's certainly up to you to build the roadway  to the bay.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm sorry things have gone badly,&#8221; replied Howland. He leaned  forward until his face was close to his companion's. &#8220;Thorne, is there  a man up here named Croisset&#8212;or a girl called Meleese?&#8221;
  He watched the senior engineer closely. Nothing to confirm his  suspicions came into Thorne's face. Thorne looked up, a little  surprised at the tone of the other's voice.
  &#8220;Not that I know of, Jack. There may be a man named Croisset among  our three hundred workers&#8212;you can tell by looking at the pay-roll.  There are fifteen or twenty married men among us and they have  families. Gregson knows more about the girls than I. Anything  particular?&#8221;
  &#8220;Just a word I've got for them&#8212;if they're here,&#8221; replied Howland  carelessly. &#8220;Are these my quarters?&#8221;
  &#8220;If you like them. When I got hurt we moved up among the men.  Brought us into closer touch with the working end, you know.&#8221;
  &#8220;You and Gregson must have been laid up at about the same time,&#8221;  said the young engineer. &#8220;That was a painful wound of Gregson's. I  wonder who the deuce it was who shot him? Funny that a man like Gregson  should have an enemy!&#8221;
  Thorne sat up with a jerk. There came the rattle of a pan from the  stove, and Howland turned his head in time to see Jackpine staring at  him as though he had exploded a mine under his feet.
  &#8220;Who shot him?&#8221; gasped the senior engineer. &#8220;Why&#8212;er&#8212;didn't Gregson  tell you that it was an accident?&#8221;
  &#8220;Why should he lie, Thorne?&#8221;
  A faint flush swept into the other's pallid face. For a moment there  was a penetrating glare in his eyes as he looked at Howland. Jackpine  still stood silent and motionless beside the stove.
  &#8220;He told me that it was an accident,&#8221; said Thorne at last.
  &#8220;Funny,&#8221; was all that Howland said, turning to the Indian as though  the matter was of no importance. &#8220;Ah, Jackpine, I'm glad to see the  coffee-pot on. I've got a box of the blackest and mildest Porto Ricans  you ever laid eyes on in my kit, Thorne, and we'll open 'em up for a  good smoke after supper. Hello, why have you got boards nailed over  that window?&#8221;
  For the first time Howland noticed that the thin muslin curtain,  which he thought had screened a window, concealed, in place of a  window, a carefully fitted barricade of plank. A sudden thrill shot  through him as he rose to examine it. With his back toward Thorne he  said, half laughing, &#8220;Perhaps Gregson was afraid that the fellow who  clipped off his finger would get him through the window, eh?&#8221;
  He pretended not to perceive the effect of his words on the senior  engineer. The two sat down to supper and for an hour after they had  finished they smoked and talked on the business of the camp. It was ten  o'clock when Thorne and Jackpine left the cabin.
  No sooner had they gone than Howland closed and barred the door,  lighted another cigar, and began pacing rapidly up and down the room.  Already there were developments. Gregson had lied to him about his  finger. Thorne had lied to him about his own injuries, whatever they  were. He was certain of these two things&#8212;and of more. The two senior  engineers were not leaving the Wekusko because of mere dissatisfaction  with the work and country. They were fleeing. And for some reason they  were keeping from him the real motive for their flight. Was it possible  that they were deliberately sacrificing him in order to save  themselves? He could not bring himself to believe this, notwithstanding  the evidence against them. Both were men of irreproachable honor.  Thorne, especially, was a man of indomitable nerve&#8212;a man who would be  the last in the world to prove treacherous to a business associate or a  friend. He was sure that neither of them knew of Croisset or of the  beautiful girl whom he had met at Prince Albert, which led him to  believe that there were other characters in the strange plot in which  he had become involved besides those whom he had encountered on the  Great North Trail. Again he examined the barricaded window and he was  more than ever convinced that his chance hit at Thorne had struck true.
  He was tired from his long day's travel but little inclination to  sleep came to him, and stretching himself out on the lounge with his  head and shoulders bolstered up with furs, he continued to smoke and  think. He was surprised when a little clock tinkled the hour of eleven.  He had not seen the clock before. Now he listened to the faint  monotonous ticking it made close to his head until he felt an impelling  drowsiness creeping over him and he closed his eyes. He was almost  asleep when it struck again&#8212;softly, and yet with sufficient loudness  to arouse him. It had struck twelve.
  With an effort Howland overcame his drowsiness and dragged himself  to a sitting posture, knowing that he should undress and go to bed. The  lamp was still burning brightly and he arose to turn down the wick.  Suddenly he stopped. To his dulled senses there came distinctly the  sound of a knock at the door. For a few moments he waited, silent and  motionless. It came again, louder than before, and yet in it there was  something of caution. It was not the heavy tattoo of one who had come  to awaken him on a matter of business.
  Who could be his midnight visitor? Softly Howland went back to his  heavy coat and slipped his small revolver into his hip pocket. The  knock came again. Then he walked to the door, shot back the bolt, and,  with his right hand gripping the butt of his pistol, flung it wide  open.
  For a moment he stood transfixed, staring speechlessly at a white,  startled face lighted up by the glow of the oil lamp. Bewildered to the  point of dumbness, he backed slowly, holding the door open, and there  entered the one person in all the world whom he wished most to see&#8212;she  who had become so strangely a part of his life since that first night  at Prince Albert, and whose sweet face was holding a deeper meaning for  him with every hour that he lived. He closed the door and turned, still  without speaking; and, impelled by a sudden spirit that sent the blood  thrilling through his veins, he held out both hands to the girl for  whom he now knew that he was willing to face all of the perils that  might await him between civilization and the bay.
