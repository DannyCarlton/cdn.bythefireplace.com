  Jan was glad when the evening came, and was gone. Not until Jean  and  Iowaka had said good night with Croisset and his wife, and both   Cummins and M&eacute;lisse had gone to their rooms, did he find himself   relieved of the tension under which he had struggled during all of   that night's merry-making in the cabin. 
  From the first he knew that his nerves were strung by some strange  and  indefinable sensation that was growing within him&#8212;something which  he  could hardly have explained at first, but which swiftly took form  and  meaning, and oppressed him more as the hours flew by. Almost  fiercely  he strove to fight back the signs of it from his face and  voice. Never  had he played as on this night. His violin leaped with  life, his voice  rose high in the wild forest songs of Jean de Gravois  and Croisset, he  sprang aloft in the caribou dance until the tips of  his fingers  touched the log beams overhead; and yet there was none of  the flush of  excitement in his face, no joyous fire flashing from his  eyes upon  M&eacute;lisse. 
  She saw this, and wondered. A dozen times her eyes encountered his,   straight and questioning, when the others were not looking. She saw in   response only a dull, lusterless glow that was not like the Jan who   had pursued her that day on the mountain-top. 
  Jan was unaware of what was lacking in him. He smiled when she gave   him these glances; deep down in him his heart trembled at the beauty   of her flushed cheeks, the luster of her coiled hair, the swimming   depths of her clear eyes; but the mask of the thing at which she   wondered still remained. 
  After the others had gone, Cummins sat up to smoke a pipe. When he  had  finished, he went to his room. Jan was now sleeping in a room at  the  company's store, and after a time he rose silently to take down  his  cap and coat. He opened the outer door quietly, so as not to  arouse  M&eacute;lisse, who had gone to bed half an hour before. 
  As he was about to go out, there came a sound&#8212;a low, gentle,   whispered word. 
  &quot;Jan!&quot; 
  He turned. M&eacute;lisse stood in her door. She had not undressed, and  her  hair was still done up in its soft coils, with the crimson  bakneesh  shining in it. She came to him hesitatingly, until she stood  with her  two hands upon his arm, gazing into his tense face with that  same  question in her eyes. 
  &quot;Jan, you were not pleased with me to-night,&quot; she whispered. &quot;Tell  me,  why?&quot; 
  &quot;I was pleased with you, M&eacute;lisse,&quot; he replied. 
  He took one of the hands that was clinging to his arm, and turned  his  face to the open night. Countless stars gleamed in the sky, as  they  had shone on another night fifteen years ago. From where they  stood  they saw the pale flicker of the aurora, sending its shivering  arrows  out over the dome of the earth, with the same lonely song that  it had  played when the woman died. Gaunt and solitary, the tall spruce  loomed  up against the silver glow, its thick head sighing faintly in  the  night wind, as if in wailing answer to that far-away music in the   skies. 
  Suddenly there leaped up from Jan Thoreau's breast a breath that  burst  from his lips in a low cry. 
  &quot;M&eacute;lisse, M&eacute;lisse, it was just fifteen years ago that I came in   through that forest out there, starved and dying, and played my violin   when your mother died. You were a little baby then, and since that   night you have never pleased me more than now!&quot; 
  He dropped her hand and turned squarely to the door, to hide what  he  knew had come into his face. He heard a soft, heart-broken little  sob  behind him, and something fell rustling upon his arm. 
  &quot;Jan, dear Jan!&quot; 
  M&eacute;lisse crowded herself into his arms, her hair torn down and  tumbling  about her shoulders. In her eyes there were the old pride and  the old  love, the love and pride of what seemed to Jan to be, years  ago, the  old, childish pleading for his comradeship, for the fun of  his strong  arms, the frolic of his laugh. Irresistibly they called to  him, and in  the old glad way he tightened his arms about her  shoulders, his eyes  glowing, and life leaping back, flushed and full,  into his face. 
  She laughed, happy and trembling, her lips held up to him. 
  &quot;I didn't please you to-day,&quot; she whispered. &quot;I will never do up my   hair again!&quot; 
  He kissed her, and his arms dropped from her shoulders. 
  &quot;Never, never again&#8212;until you have forgotten to love me,&quot; she   repeated. &quot;Good night, Brother Jan!&quot; 
  Across the open, through the thinned edge of the black spruce,  deeper  and deeper into the cold, unquivering lifelessness of the  forest, Jan  went from the door that closed between him and M&eacute;lisse,  her last words  still whispering in his ears, the warm touch of her  hair on his  cheeks&#8212;and the knowledge of what this day had meant for  him swiftly  surging upon him, bringing with it a torment which racked  him to the  soul. 
  Fifteen years ago! He stopped and looked up, the starlight  whitening  his face. There was no change in this night from that other  one of  ages and ages ago. There were the same stars, like fierce eyes  of pale  fire, robbed of softness by the polar cold; there were the  same  cloudless blue space, the same hissing flashes of the aurora  leaping  through its infinity, the same trees that had listened to his  moaning  prayers on that night when he had staggered into Lac Bain. 
  He went on until he came to where the beaten trail swept up and  away  from a swamp. As vividly as if it had happened but yesterday, he   remembered how he had dragged himself through this swamp, bleeding and   starving, his violin clutched to his breast, guided by the barking of   dogs, which seemed to come from a million miles away. He plunged into   it now, picking his tangled way until he stood upon a giant ridge,   from which he looked out through the white night into the limitless   barrens to the north. 
  Along the edge of those barrens he had come, daring the hundred  deaths  between hunter's cabin and Indian wigwam, starving at times,  almost  dying of cold, building fires to keep the wolves back, and  playing&#8212;  always playing to keep up his courage, until he found  M&eacute;lisse. Fifteen  years had passed since then, and the cumulative force  of the things  that had grown out of those years had fallen upon him  this day. He had  felt it first when M&eacute;lisse turned upon him at the  foot of the  mountain; and after that in the cabin, in every breath he  drew, in  every look that he gave her. For him she had changed for all  time. She  was no longer the little M&eacute;lisse, his sister. And yet&#8212; 
  He was almost saying her last words aloud: 
  &quot;Good night, Brother Jan!&quot; 
  She had come to him that day to let him kiss her, as she had come  to  him a thousand times before; but he had not kissed her in the old  way.  It was a different love that his lips had given, and even now the  hot  blood surged again into his face as he thought of what he had  done.  His was a different idea of honor from that held by men born to  the  ways of passion. 
  In that which had stirred his blood, thrilling him with strange joy  as  he held her in his arms, he saw more than the shadow of  sin&#8212;sacrilege  against a thing which was more precious to him than  life. M&eacute;lisse came  to him still as his sister, abiding in her glorious  faith in him,  unaware of his temptation; while he, Jan Thoreau&#8212; 
  He thrust a hand inside his coat and clutched at the papers that  Jean  de Gravois had read. Then he drew them forth, slowly, and held  them  crumpled in his fingers, while for many minutes he stared  straight out  into the gray gloom of the treeless plain. 
  His eyes shifted. Searchingly they traveled up the face of the  crags  behind him. They hunted where the starlight made deep pits of  gloom in  the twisting edge of the mountains. They went from rock to  rock and  from tree to tree until at last they rested upon a giant  spruce which  hung out over the precipitous wall of the ridge, its  thick top  beckoning and sighing to the black rocks that shot up out of  the snow  five hundred feet below. 
  It was a strange tree, weird and black, free of stub or bough for a   hundred feet, and from far out on the barrens those who traveled their   solitary ways east and west knew that it was a monument shaped by men.   Mukee had told Jan its story. In the first autumn of the woman's life   at Lac Bain, he and Per-ee had climbed the old spruce, lopping off its   branches until only the black cap remained; and after that it was   known far and wide as the &quot;lobstick&quot; of Cummins' wife. It was a   voiceless cenotaph which signified that all the honor and love known   to the wilderness people had been given to her. 
  To it went Jan, the papers still held in his hand. He had seen a  pair  of whisky-jacks storing food in the butt of the tree, two or  three  summers before, and now his fingers groped for the hole. When he  found  it, he thrust in the papers, crowded them down, and filled the  hole  with chunks of bark. 
  &quot;Always my sister&#8212;and never anything more to Jan Thoreau,&quot; he said   gently in French, as if he were speaking to a spirit in the old tree.   &quot;That is the honor of these snows; it is what the great God means us   to be.&quot; The strife had gone from his voice; it rose strong and clear   as he stretched his arms high up along the shorn side of the spruce,   his eyes upon the silent plume that heard his oath. &quot;I swear that Jan   Thoreau will never do wrong to the little M&eacute;lisse!&quot; 
  With a face white and set in its determination, he turned slowly  away  from the tree. Far away, from the lonely depths of the swamp,  there  came the wailing howl of a wolf&#8212;a cry of hungerful savageness  that  died away in echoes of infinite sadness. It was like the howling  of a  dog at the door of a cabin in which his master lay dead, and the  sound  of it swept a flood of loneliness into Jan's heart. It was the  death-  wail of his own last hope, which had gone out of him for ever  that  night. 
  He listened, and it came again; but in the middle of it, when the   long, moaning grief of the voice was rising to its full despair, there   broke in a sharp interruption&#8212;a shrieking, yelping cry, such as a dog   makes when it is suddenly struck. In another moment the forest   thrilled with the deep-throated pack-call of the wolf who has started   a fresh kill. Hardly had its echoes died away when, from deeper in the   swamp, there came another cry, and still another from the mountain;   and up and out of the desolation rose the calls of others of the   scattered pack, in quick response to the comrade who had first found   meat. 
  All the cries were alike, filled with that first wailing grief,  except  that of the swelling throat which was sending forth the call to  food.  A few minutes, and another of the mournful howls changed into  the  fierce hunt-cry; then a second, a third, and a fourth, and the  sound  of the chase swept swiftly from the swamp to the mountain, up  the  mountain and down into the barrens. 
  &quot;A caribou!&quot; cried Jan softly. &quot;A caribou, and he is going into the   barrens. There is no water, and he is lost!&quot; 
  He ran and leaned over beside the old tree, so that the great plain   stretched out below him. Into the west turned the pack, the hunt-cry   growing fainter until it almost died away. Then, slowly, it grew again   in volume, swinging into the north, then to the east&#8212;approaching   nearer and nearer until Jan saw a dark, swiftly moving blot in the   white gloom. 
  The caribou passed by within half a rifle-shot of him; another half   rifle-shot behind followed the wolves, flung out fan-shape, their gray   bodies moving like specters in a half-moon cordon, and their leaders   almost abreast the caribou a dozen rods to each side. 
  There was no sound now. Below him, Jan could see the pale glimmer  of  ice and snow, where in summer there was a small lake. Desperately  the  caribou made an effort to reach this lake. The wolves drew in. The   moon-shape of their bodies shrunk until it was nearer a circle. From   the plain side the leading wolf closed until he was running at the   caribou's forelegs. The mountain wolf responded on the opposite side.   Then came the end, quick, decisive, and without sound. 
  After a few moments there came faintly the snapping of jaws and the   crunching of bones. Torn and bleeding, and yet quivering with life,   the caribou was given up to the feast. 
  Jan turned away from the scene. Torn and bleeding at his own heart,  he  went back to Lac Bain.
