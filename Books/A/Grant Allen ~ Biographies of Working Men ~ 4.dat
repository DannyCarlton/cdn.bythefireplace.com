Old Isaac Herschel, the oboe-player of the King's Guard in Hanover, had  served with his regiment for many years in the chilly climate of North  Germany, and was left at last broken down in health and spirits by the  many hardships of several severe European campaigns. Isaac Herschel was  a man of tastes and education above his position; but he had married a  person in some respects quite unfitted for him. His good wife, Anna,  though an excellent housekeeper and an estimable woman in her way, had  never even learned to write; and when the pair finally settled down to  old age in Hanover, they were hampered by the cares of a large family of  ten children. Respectable poverty in Germany is even more pressing than  in England; the decent poor are accustomed to more frugal fare and  greater privations than with us; and the domestic life of the Herschel  family circle must needs have been of the most careful and penurious  description. Still, Isaac Herschel dearly loved his art, and in it he  found many amends and consolations for the sordid shifts and troubles of  a straitened German household. All his spare time was given to music,  and in his later days he was enabled to find sufficient pupils to eke  out his little income with comparative comfort.    
William Herschel, the great astronomer (born in 1738), was the fourth  child of his mother, and with his brothers he was brought up at the  garrison school in Hanover, together with the sons of the other common  soldiers. There he learned, not only the three R's, but also a little  French and English. Still, the boy was not content with these ordinary  studies; in his own playtime he took lessons in Latin and mathematics  privately with the regimental schoolmaster. The young Herschels, indeed,  were exceptionally fortunate in the possession of an excellent and  intelligent father, who was able to direct their minds into channels  which few people of their position in life have the opportunity of  entering. Isaac Herschel was partly of Jewish descent, and he inherited  in a marked degree two very striking Jewish gifts--a turn for music, and  a turn for philosophy. The Jews are probably the oldest civilized race  now remaining on earth; and their musical faculties have been  continuously exercised from a time long before the days of David, so  that now they produce undoubtedly a far larger proportion of musicians  and composers than any other class of the population whatsoever. They  are also deeply interested in the same profound theological and  philosophical problems which were discussed with so much acuteness and  freedom in the Book of Ecclesiastes and the subtle argument of Job and  his friends. There has never been a time when the Jewish mind has not  exercised itself profoundly on these deep and difficult questions; and  the Hanover bandsman inherited from his Jewish ancestry an unusual  interest in similar philosophical subjects. Thus, while the little ones  were sleeping in the same common room at night, William and his father  were often heard discussing the ideas of such abstruse thinkers as  Newton and Leibnitz, whose names must have sounded strange indeed to the  ordinary frequenters of the Hanover barracks. On such occasions good  dame Herschel was often compelled to interpose between them, lest the  loudness of their logic should wake the younger children in the crib  hard by.    
William, however, possessed yet another gift, which he is less likely to  have derived from the Jewish side of the house. He and his brother  Alexander were both distinguished by a natural taste for mechanics, and  early gave proof of their learning by turning neat globes with the  equator and ecliptic accurately engraved upon them, or by making model  instruments for their own amusement out of bits of pasteboard. Thus, in  early opportunities and educational advantages, the young Herschels  certainly started in life far better equipped than most working men's  sons; and, considering their father's doubtful position, it may seem at  first sight rather a stretch of language to describe him as a working  man at all. Nevertheless, when one remembers the humble grade of  military bandsmen in Germany, even at the present day, and the fact that  most of the Herschel family remained in that grade during all their  lives, it is clear that William Herschel's life may be fairly included  within the scope of the present series. "In my fifteenth year," he says  himself, "I enlisted in military service," and he evidently looked upon  his enlistment in exactly the same light as that of any ordinary  soldier.    
England and Hanover were, of course, very closely connected together at  the middle of the last century. The king moved about a great deal from  one country to the other; and in 1755 the regiment of Hanoverian Guards  was ordered on service to England for a year. William Herschel, then  seventeen years of age, and already a member of the band, went together  with his father; and it was in this modest capacity that he first made  acquaintance with the land where he was afterwards to attain the dignity  of knighthood and the post of the king's astronomer. He played the oboe,  like his father before him, and no doubt underwent the usual severe  military discipline of that age of stiff stocks and stern punishments.  His pay was very scanty, and out of it he only saved enough to carry  home one memento of his English experiences. That memento was in itself  a sufficient mark of the stuff from which young Herschel was compounded.  It was a copy of "Locke on the Human Understanding." Now, Locke's famous  work, oftener named than read, is a very tough and serious bit of  philosophical exposition; and a boy of seventeen who buys such a book  out of his meagre earnings as a military bandsman is pretty sure not to  end his life within the four dismal bare walls of the barrack. It is  indeed a curious picture to imagine young William Herschel, among a  group of rough and boisterous German soldiers, discussing high  mathematical problems with his father, or sitting down quietly in a  corner to read "Locke on the Human Understanding."    
In 1757, during the Seven Years' War, Herschel was sent with his  regiment to serve in the campaign of Rossbach against the French. He was  not physically strong, and the hardships of active service told terribly  upon the still growing lad. His parents were alarmed at his appearance  when he returned, and were very anxious to "remove" him from the  service. That, however, was by no means an easy matter for them to  accomplish. They had no money to buy his discharge, and so, not to call  the transaction by any other than its true name, William Herschel was  forced to run away from the army. We must not judge too harshly of this  desertion, for the times were hard, and the lives of men in Herschel's  position were valued at very little by the constituted authorities. Long  after, it is said, when Herschel had distinguished himself by the  discovery of the planet Uranus, a pardon for this high military offence  was duly handed to him by the king in person on the occasion of his  first presentation. George III. was not a particularly wise or brilliant  man; but even he had sense enough to perceive that William Herschel  could serve the country far better by mapping out the stars of heaven  than by playing the oboe to the royal regiment of Hanoverian Guards.    
William was nineteen when he ran away. His good mother packed his boxes  for him with such necessaries as she could manage, and sent them after  him to Hamburg, but, to the boy's intense disgust, she forgot to send  the copy of "Locke on the Human Understanding." What a sturdy deserter  we have here, to be sure! "She, dear woman," he says plaintively, "knew  no other wants than good linen and clothing!" So William Herschel the  oboe player started off alone to earn his living as best he might in the  great world of England. It is strange he should have chosen that, of all  European countries; for there alone he was liable to be arrested as a  deserter: but perhaps his twelvemonth's stay in London may have given  him a sense of being at home amongst us which he would have lacked in  any other part of Europe. At any rate, hither he came, and for the next  three years picked up a livelihood, we know not how, as many other  excellent German bandsmen have done before and since him. Our  information about his early life is very meagre, and at this period we  lose sight of him for a while altogether.    
About the year 1760, however, we catch another incidental glimpse of the  young musician in his adopted country. By that time, he had found  himself once more a regular post as oboist to the Durham militia, then  quartered for its muster at Pontefract. A certain Dr. Miller, an  organist at Doncaster, was dining one evening at the officers' mess;  when his host happened to speak to him in high praise of a young German  they had in their band, who was really, he said, a most remarkable and  spirited performer. Dr. Miller asked to see (or rather hear) this clever  musician; so Herschel was called up, and made to go through a solo for  the visitor's gratification. The organist was surprised at his admirable  execution, and asked him on what terms he was engaged to the Durham  militia. "Only from month to month," Herschel answered. "Then leave them  at the end of your month," said Miller, "and come to live with me. I'm a  single man; I think we can manage together; and I'm sure I can get you a  better situation." Herschel frankly accepted the offer so kindly made,  and seems to have lived for much of the next five years with Miller in  his little two-roomed cottage at Doncaster. Here he took pupils and  performed in the orchestra at public concerts, always in a very quiet  and modest fashion. He also lived for part of the time with a Mr. Bulman  at Leeds, for whom he afterwards generously provided a place as clerk to  the Octagon Chapel at Bath. Indeed, it is a very pleasing trait in  William Herschel's character that to the end he was constantly engaged  in finding places for his early friends, as well as for the less  energetic or less fortunate members of his own family.    
During these years, Herschel also seems to have given much attention to  the organ, which enabled him to make his next step in life in 1765, when  he was appointed organist at Halifax. Now, there is a great social  difference between the position of an oboe-player in a band and a church  organist; and it was through his organ-playing that Herschel was finally  enabled to leave his needy hand-to-mouth life in Yorkshire. A year  later, he obtained the post of organist to the Octagon Chapel at Bath,  an engagement which gave him new opportunities of turning his mind to  the studies for which he possessed a very marked natural inclination.  Bath was in those days not only the most fashionable watering-place in  England, but almost the only fashionable watering-place in the whole  kingdom. It was, to a certain extent, all that Brighton, Scarborough,  Buxton, and Harrogate are to-day, and something more. In our own time,  when railways and steamboats have so altered the face of the world, the  most wealthy and fashionable English society resorts a great deal to  continental pleasure towns like Cannes, Nice, Florence, Vichy, Baden,  Ems, and Homburg; but in the eighteenth century it resorted almost  exclusively to Bath. The Octagon Chapel was in one sense the centre of  life in Bath; and through his connection with it, Herschel was thrown  into a far more intelligent and learned society than that which he had  left behind him in still rural Yorkshire. New books came early to Bath,  and were read and discussed in the reading-rooms; famous men and women  came there, and contributed largely to the intellectual life of the  place; the theatre was the finest out of London; the Assembly Rooms were  famous as the greatest resort of wit and culture in the whole kingdom.  Herschel here was far more in his element than in the barracks of  Hanover, or in the little two-roomed cottage at rustic Doncaster.    
He worked very hard indeed, and his work soon brought him comfort and  comparative wealth. Besides his chapel services, and his later  engagement in the orchestra of the Assembly Rooms, he had often as many  as thirty-eight private pupils in music every week; and he also composed  a few pieces, which were published in London with some modest success.  Still, in spite of all these numerous occupations, the eager young  German found a little leisure time to devote to self-education; so much  so that, after a fatiguing day of fourteen or sixteen hours spent in  playing the organ and teaching, he would "unbend his mind" by studying  the higher mathematics, or give himself a lesson in Greek and Italian.  At the same time, he was also working away at a line of study, seemingly  useless to him, but in which he was afterwards to earn so great and  deserved a reputation. Among the books he read during this Bath period  were Smith's "Optics" and Lalande's "Astronomy." Throughout all his own  later writings, the influence of these two books, thoroughly mastered by  constant study in the intervals of his Bath music lessons, makes itself  everywhere distinctly felt.    
Meanwhile, the family at Hanover had not been flourishing quite so  greatly as the son William was evidently doing in wealthy England.  During all those years, the young man had never forgotten to keep up a  close correspondence with his people in Germany. Already, in 1764,  during his Yorkshire days, William Herschel had managed out of his  savings as an oboe-player to make a short trip to his old home; and his  sister Carolina, afterwards his chief assistant in his astronomical  labours, notes with pleasure the delight she felt in having her beloved  brother with her once more, though she, poor girl, being cook to the  household apparently, could only enjoy his society when she was not  employed "in the drudgery of the scullery." A year later, when William  had returned to England again, and had just received his appointment as  organist at Halifax, his father, Isaac, had a stroke of paralysis which  ended his violin-playing for ever, and forced him to rely thenceforth  upon copying music for a precarious livelihood. In 1767 he died, and  poor Carolina saw before her in prospect nothing but a life of that  domestic drudgery which she so disliked. "I could not bear the idea of  being turned into a housemaid," she says; and she thought that if only  she could take a few lessons in music and fancy work she might get "a  place as governess in some family where the want of a knowledge of  French would be no objection." But, unhappily, good dame Herschel, like  many other uneducated and narrow-minded persons, had a strange dread of  too much knowledge. She thought that "nothing further was needed," says  Carolina, "than to send me two or three months to a sempstress to be  taught to make household linen; so all that my father could do was to  indulge me sometimes with a short lesson on the violin when my mother  was either in good humour or out of the way. It was her certain belief  that my brother William would have returned to his country, and my  eldest brother would not have looked so high, if they had had a little  less learning." Poor, purblind, well-meaning, obstructive old dame  Herschel! what a boon to the world that children like yours are  sometimes seized with this incomprehensible fancy for "looking too  high"!    
Nevertheless, Carolina managed by rising early to take a few lessons at  daybreak from a young woman whose parents lived in the same cottage with  hers; and so she got through a little work before the regular daily  business of the family began at seven. Imagine her delight then, just as  the difficulties after her father's death are making that housemaid's  place seem almost inevitable, when she gets a letter from William at  Bath, asking her to come over to England and join him at that gay and  fashionable city. He would try to prepare her for singing at his  concerts; but if after two years' trial she didn't succeed, he would  take her back again to Hanover himself. In 1772, indeed, William in  person came over to fetch her, and thenceforth the brother and sister  worked unceasingly together in all their undertakings to the day of the  great astronomer's death.    
About this time Herschel had been reading Ferguson's "Astronomy," and  felt very desirous of seeing for himself the objects in the heavens,  invisible to the naked eye, of which he there found descriptions. For  this purpose he must of course have a telescope. But how to obtain one?  that was the question. There was a small two-and-a-half foot instrument  on hire at one of the shops at Bath; and the ambitious organist borrowed  this poor little glass for a time, not merely to look through, but to  use as a model for constructing one on his own account. Buying was  impossible, of course, for telescopes cost much money: but making would  not be difficult for a determined mind. He had always been of a  mechanical turn, and he was now fired with a desire to build himself a  telescope eighteen or twenty feet long. He sent to London for the  lenses, which could not be bought at Bath; and Carolina amused herself  by making a pasteboard tube to fit them in her leisure hours. It was  long before he reached twenty feet, indeed: his first effort was a  seven-foot, attained only "after many continuous determined trials." The  amateur pasteboard frame did not fully answer Herschel's expectations,  so he was obliged to go in grudgingly for the expense of a tin tube. The  reflecting mirror which he ought to have had proved too dear for his  still slender purse, and he thus had to forego it with much regret. But  he found a man at Bath who had once been in the mirror-polishing line;  and he bought from him for a bargain all his rubbish of patterns, tools,  unfinished mirrors and so forth, with which he proceeded to experiment  on the manufacture of a proper telescope. In the summer, when the season  was over, and all the great people had left Bath, the house, as Carolina  says ruefully, "was turned into a workshop." William's younger brother  Alexander was busy putting up a big lathe in a bedroom, grinding glasses  and turning eyepieces while in the drawing-room itself, sacred to  William's aristocratic pupils, a carpenter, sad to relate, was engaged  in making a tube and putting up stands for the future telescopes. Sad  goings on, indeed, in the family of a respectable music-master and  organist! Many a good solid shopkeeper in Bath must no doubt have shaken  his grey head solemnly as he passed the door, and muttered to himself  that that young German singer fellow was clearly going on the road to  ruin with his foolish good-for-nothing star-gazing.    
In 1774, when William Herschel was thirty-six, he had at last  constructed himself a seven-foot telescope, and began for the first time  in his life to view the heavens in a systematic manner. From this he  advanced to a ten-foot, and then to one of twenty, for he meant to see  stars that no astronomer had ever yet dreamt of beholding. It was  comparatively late in life to begin, but Herschel had laid a solid  foundation already, and he was enabled therefore to do an immense deal  in the second half of those threescore years and ten which are the  allotted average life of man, but which he himself really overstepped by  fourteen winters. As he said long afterwards with his modest manner to  the poet Campbell, "I have looked further into space than ever human  being did before me; I have observed stars of which the light, it can be  proved, must take two millions of years to reach this earth." That would  have been a grand thing for any man to be able truthfully to say under  any circumstances: it was a marvellous thing for a man who had laboured  under all the original disadvantages of Herschel--a man who began life  as a penniless German bandsman, and up to the age of thirty-six had  never even looked through a telescope.    
At this time, Herschel was engaged in playing the harpsichord in the  orchestra of the theatre; and it was during the interval between the  acts that he made his first general survey of the heavens. The moment  his part was finished, he would rush out to gaze through his telescope;  and in these short periods he managed to observe all the visible stars  of what are called the first, second, third, and fourth magnitudes.  Henceforth he went on building telescope after telescope, each one  better than the last; and now all his glasses were ground and polished  either by his own hand or by his brother Alexander's. Carolina meanwhile  took her part in the workshop; but as she had also to sing at the  oratorios, and her awkward German manners might shock the sensitive  nerves of the Bath aristocrats, she took two lessons a week for a whole  twelvemonth (she tells us in her delightfully straightforward fashion)  "from Miss Fleming, the celebrated dancing mistress, to drill me for a  gentlewoman." Poor Carolina, there she was mistaken: Miss Fleming could  make her into no gentlewoman, for she was born one already, and nothing  proves it more than the perfect absence of false shame with which in her  memoirs she tells us all these graphic little details of their early  humble days.    
While they were thus working at Bath an incident occurred which is worth  mentioning because it shows the very different directions in which the  presence or the want of steady persistence may lead the various members  of the very self-same family. William received a letter from his widowed  mother at Hanover to say, in deep distress, that Dietrich, the youngest  brother, had run away from home, it was supposed for the purpose of  going to India, "with a young idler no older than himself." Forthwith,  the budding astronomer left the lathe where he was busy turning an eye-  piece from a cocoa-nut shell, and, like a good son and brother as he  always was, hurried off to Holland and thence to Hanover. No Dietrich  was anywhere to be found. But while he was away, Carolina at Bath  received a letter from Dietrich himself, to tell her ruefully he was  "laid up very ill" at a waterside tavern in Wapping--not the nicest or  most savoury East End sailor-suburb of London. Alexander immediately  took the coach to town, put the prodigal into a decent lodging, nursed  him carefully for a fortnight, and then took him down with him in  triumph to the family home at Bath. There brother William found him safe  and sound on his return, under the sisterly care of good Carolina. A  pretty dance he had led the two earnest and industrious astronomers; but  they seem always to have treated this black sheep of the family with  uniform kindness, and long afterwards Sir William remembered him  favourably in his last will.    
In 1779 and the succeeding years the three Herschels were engaged during  all their spare time in measuring the heights of about one hundred  mountains in the moon, which William gauged by three different methods.  In the same year, he made an acquaintance of some importance to him, as  forming his first introduction to the wider world of science in London  and elsewhere. Dr. Watson, a Fellow of the Royal Society, happened to  see him working at his telescope; and this led to a visit from the  electrician to the amateur astronomer. Dr. Watson was just then engaged  in getting up a Philosophical Society at Bath (a far rarer institution  at that time in a provincial town than now), and he invited William  Herschel to join it. Here Herschel learned for the first time to mix  with those who were more nearly his intellectual equals, and to measure  his strength against other men's.    
It was in 1781 that Herschel made the great discovery which immediately  established his fame as an astronomer, and enabled him to turn from  conducting concerts to the far higher work of professionally observing  the stars. On the night of Tuesday, March 13th, Herschel was engaged in  his usual systematic survey of the sky, a bit at a time, when his  telescope lighted among a group of small fixed stars upon what he at  first imagined to be a new comet. It proved to be no comet, however, but  a true planet--a veritable world, revolving like our own in a nearly  circular path around the sun as centre, though far more remote from it  than the most distant planet then known, Saturn. Herschel called his new  world the <i>Georgium Sidus</i> (King George's star) in honour of the  reigning monarch; but it has since been known as Uranus. Astronomers all  over Europe were soon apprised of this wonderful discovery, and the path  of the freshly found planet was computed by calculation, its distance  from the sun being settled at nineteen times that of our own earth.    
In order faintly to understand the importance attached at the time to  Herschel's observation of this very remote and seemingly petty world, we  must remember that up to that date all the planets which circle round  our own sun had been familiarly known to everybody from time immemorial.  To suggest that there was yet another world belonging to our system  outside the path of the furthest known planet would have seemed to most  people like pure folly. Since then, we have grown quite accustomed to  the discovery of a fresh small world or two every year, and we have even  had another large planet (Neptune), still more remote than Herschel's  Uranus, added to the list of known orbs in our own solar system. But in  Herschel's day, nobody had ever heard of a new planet being discovered  since the beginning of all things. A hundred years before, an Italian  astronomer, it is true, had found out four small moons revolving round  Saturn, besides the big moon then already known; but for a whole  century, everybody believed that the solar system was now quite fully  explored, and that nothing fresh could be discovered about it. Hence  Herschel's observation produced a very different effect from, say, the  discovery of the two moons which revolve round Mars, in our own day.  Even people who felt no interest in astronomy were aroused to attention.  Mr. Herschel's new planet became the talk of the town and the subject of  much admiring discussion in the London newspapers. Strange, indeed, that  an amateur astronomer of Bath, a mere German music-master, should have  hit upon a planet which escaped the sight even of the king's own  Astronomer Royal at Greenwich.    
Of course there were not people wanting who ascribed this wonderful  discovery of Herschel's to pure chance. If he hadn't just happened to  turn his telescope in that particular direction on that particular  night, he wouldn't have seen this <i>Georgium Sidus</i> they made such a  fuss about at all. Quite so. And if he hadn't built a twenty-foot  telescope for himself, he wouldn't have turned it anywhere at any time.  But Herschel himself knew better. "This was by no means the result of  chance," he said; "but a simple consequence of the position of the  planet on that particular evening, since it occupied precisely that spot  in the heavens which came in the order of the minute observations that I  had previously mapped out for myself. Had I not seen it just when I did,  I must inevitably have come upon it soon after, since my telescope was  so perfect that I was able to distinguish it from a fixed star in the  first minute of observation." Indeed, when once Herschel's twenty-foot  telescope was made, he could not well have failed in the long run to  discover Uranus, as his own description of his method clearly shows.  "When I had carefully and thoroughly perfected the great instrument in  all its parts," he says, "I made a systematic use of it in my  observation of the heaven, first forming a determination never to pass  by any, the smallest, portion of them without due investigation. This  habit, persisted in, led to the discovery of the new planet (<i>Georgium  Sidus</i>)." As well might one say that a skilled mining surveyor,  digging for coal, came upon the seam by chance, as ascribe to chance the  necessary result of such a careful and methodical scrutiny as this.    
Before the year was out, the ingenious Mr. Herschel of Bath was elected  a Fellow of the Royal Society, and was also presented with the Copley  gold medal. From this moment all the distinguished people in Bath were  anxious to be introduced to the philosophical music-master; and, indeed,  they intruded so much upon his time that the daily music lessons were  now often interrupted. He was soon, however, to give up lessons for  ever, and devote himself to his more congenial and natural work in  astronomy. In May, 1782, he went up to London, to be formally admitted  to his Fellowship of the Royal Society. There he stayed so long that  poor Carolina was quite frightened. It was "double the time which my  brother could safely be absent from his scholars." The connection would  be broken up, and the astronomy would be the ruin of the family. (A  little of good old dame Herschel's housewifely leaven here, perhaps.)  But William's letters from London to "Dear Lina" must soon have quieted  her womanly fears. William had actually been presented to the king, and  "met with a very gracious reception." He had explained the solar system  to the king and queen, and his telescope was to be put up first at  Greenwich and then at Richmond. The Greenwich authorities were delighted  with his instrument; they have seen what Herschel calls "<i>my</i> fine  double stars" with it. "All my papers are printing," he tells Lina with  pardonable pride, "and are allowed to be very valuable." But he himself  is far from satisfied as yet with the results of his work. Evidently no  small successes in the field of knowledge will do for William Herschel.  "Among opticians and astronomers," he writes to Lina, "nothing now is  talked of but <i>what they call</i> my great discoveries. Alas! this  shows how far they are behind, when such trifles as I have seen and done  are called <i>great</i>. Let me but get at it again! I will make such  telescopes and see such things!" Well, well, William Herschel, in that  last sentence we get the very keynote of true greatness and true genius.    
But must he go back quietly to Bath and the toils of teaching? "An  intolerable waste of time," he thought it. The king happily relieved him  from this intolerable waste. He offered Herschel a salary of L200 a year  if he would come and live at Datchet, and devote himself entirely to  astronomical observations. It was by no means a munificent sum for a  king to offer for such labour; but Herschel gladly accepted it, as it  would enable him to give up the interruption of teaching, and spend all  his time on his beloved astronomy. His Bath friend, Sir William Watson,  exclaimed when he heard of it, "Never bought monarch honour so cheap."  Herschel was forty-three when he removed to Datchet, and from that day  forth he lived almost entirely in his observatory, wholly given up to  his astronomical pursuits. Even when he had to go to London to read his  papers before the Royal Society, he chose a moonlight night (when the  stars would be mostly invisible), so that it might not interfere with  his regular labours.    
Poor Carolina was horrified at the house at Datchet, which seemed  terribly desolate and poor, even to her modest German ideas; but William  declared his willingness to live permanently and cheerfully upon "eggs  and bacon" now that he was at last free to do nothing on earth but  observe the heavens. Night after night he and Carolina worked together  at their silent task--he noting the small features with his big  telescope, she "sweeping for comets" with a smaller glass or "finder."  Herschel could have had no more useful or devoted assistant than his  sister, who idolized him with all her heart. Alexander, too, came to  stay with them during the slack months at Bath, and then the whole  strength of the family was bent together on their labour of love in  gauging the heavens.    
But what use was it all? Why should they wish to go star-gazing? Well,  if a man cannot see for himself what use it was, nobody else can put the  answer into him, any more than they could put into him a love for  nature, or for beauty, or for art, or for music, if he had it not to  start with. What is the good of a great picture, a splendid oratorio, a  grand poem? To the man who does not care for them, nothing; to the man  who loves them, infinite. It is just the same with science. The use of  knowledge to a mind like Herschel's is the mere possession of it. With  such as he, it is a love, an object of desire, a thing to be sought  after for its own sake; and the mere act of finding it is in itself  purely delightful. "Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man  that getteth understanding. For the merchandise of it is better than the  merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. She is more  precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not to be  compared unto her." So, to such a man as Herschel, that peaceful  astronomer life at Datchet was indeed, in the truest sense of those  much-abused words, "success in life." If you had asked some vulgar-  minded neighbour of the great Sir William in his later days whether the  astronomer had been a successful man or not, he would doubtless have  answered, after his kind, "Certainly. He has been made a knight, has  lands in two counties, and has saved L35,000." But if you had asked  William Herschel himself, he would probably have said, with his usual  mixture of earnestness and humility, "Yes, I have been a very fortunate  man in life. I have discovered Uranus, and I have gauged all the depths  of heaven, as none before ever gauged them, with my own great  telescope."    
Still, those who cannot sympathize with the pure love of knowledge for  its own sake--one of the highest and noblest of human aims--should  remember that astronomy is also of immense practical importance to  mankind, and especially to navigation and commerce. Unless great  astronomical calculations were correctly performed at Greenwich and  elsewhere, it would be impossible for any ship or steamer to sail with  safety from England to Australia or America. Every defect in our  astronomical knowledge helps to wreck our vessels on doubtful coasts;  every advance helps to save the lives of many sailors and the cargoes of  many merchants. It is this practical utility of astronomy that justifies  the spending of national money on observatories and transits of Venus,  and it is the best apology for an astronomer's life to those who do not  appreciate the use of knowledge for its own beauty.    
At Datchet, Herschel not only made several large telescopes for sale,  for which he obtained large prices, but he also got a grant of L2000  from the king to aid him in constructing his huge forty-foot instrument.  It was here, too, in 1783, that Herschel married. His wife was a widow  lady of scientific tastes like his own, and she was possessed of  considerable means, which enabled him henceforth to lay aside all  anxiety on the score of money. They had but one child, a son, afterwards  Sir John Herschel, almost as great an astronomer as his father had been  before him. In 1785, the family moved to Clay Hall, in Old Windsor, and  in 1786 to Slough, where Herschel lived for the remainder of his long  life. How completely his whole soul was bound up in his work is shown in  the curious fact recorded for us by Carolina Herschel. The last night at  Clay Hall was spent in sweeping the sky with the great glass till  daylight; and by the next evening the telescope stood ready for  observations once more in the new home at Slough.    
To follow Herschel through the remainder of his life would be merely to  give a long catalogue of his endless observations and discoveries among  the stars. Such a catalogue would be interesting only to astronomers;  yet it would truly give the main facts of Herschel's existence in his  happy home at Slough. Honoured by the world, dearly loved in his own  family, and engrossed with a passionate affection for his chosen  science, the great astronomer and philosopher grew grey in peace under  his own roof, in the course of a singularly placid and gentle old age.  In 1802 he laid before the Royal Society a list of five thousand new  stars, star-clusters, or other heavenly bodies which he had discovered,  and which formed the great body of his personal additions to  astronomical knowledge. The University of Oxford made him Doctor of  Laws, and very late in life he was knighted by the king--a too tardy  acknowledgment of his immense services to science. To the very last,  however, he worked on with a will; and, indeed, it is one of the great  charms of scientific interest that it thus enables a man to keep his  faculties on the alert to an advanced old age. In 1819, when Herschel  was more than eighty, he writes to his sister a short note--"Lina, there  is a great comet. I want you to assist me. Come to dine and spend the  day here. If you can come soon after one o'clock, we shall have time to  prepare maps and telescopes. I saw its situation last night. It has a  long tail." How delightful to find such a living interest in life at the  age of eighty!    
On the 25th of August, 1822, this truly great and simple man passed  away, in his eighty-fifth year. It has been possible here only to sketch  out the chief personal points in his career, without dwelling much upon  the scientific importance of his later life-long labours; but it must  suffice to say briefly upon this point that Herschel's work was no mere  mechanical star-finding; it was the most profoundly philosophical  astronomical work ever performed, except perhaps Newton's and Laplace's.  Among astronomers proper there has been none distinguished by such  breadth of grasp, such wide conceptions, and such perfect clearness of  view as the self-taught oboe-player of Hanover.
