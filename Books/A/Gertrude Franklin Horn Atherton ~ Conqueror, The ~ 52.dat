And through it all Hamilton was sensible that someone was working for  him, and was not long attributing the influence to its proper source.  Mysterious hints were dropped of political reunions in a house on a  thickly wooded hill, a quarter of a mile behind the Governor's, the  fortunate guests to which enchanted abode being sworn to secrecy. That  it was the nightly resort of Clintonians was an open secret, but that  Federalism was being intelligently interpreted, albeit with deepest  subtlety, was guessed by few of the visitors themselves, and Hamilton  divined rather than heard it. If converts were not actually made, they  were at least undergoing a process of education which would make them  the more susceptible to Hamilton's final effort. Even before he caught a  glimpse of radiant hair among the maples, when riding one day along the  lane at the foot of the hill, he suspected that Mrs. Croix had preceded  the Convention with the deliberate intention of giving him the precious  assistance of a woman with a talent for politics and a genius for men.  He was touched, interested, intrigued, but he resisted the temptation to  precipitate himself into the eddies of her magnetism. Croix was in  England, but even before his departure, which among men was regarded as  final, she had achieved a reputation as a lady of erratic impulse and  imperious habit. That she was also the most brilliant and fascinating  woman in America, as well as the most beautiful, were facts as publicly  established. Hamilton had resisted the temptation to meet her, the  temptation receiving no help from indifference on the part of the lady;  he had answered more than one note of admirable deftness. But he had no  intention of being drawn into an intrigue which would be public gossip  in a day and ruin the happiness of his wife. To expect a man of  Hamilton's order of genius to keep faith with one woman for a lifetime  would be as reasonable as to look for such genius without the  transcendent passions which are its furnace; but he was far from being a  man who sought adventure. Under certain conditions his horizon abruptly  contracted, and life was dual and isolated; but when the opportunity had  passed he dismissed its memory with contrite philosophy, and was so  charming to Betsey that he persuaded himself, as her, that he wished  never to behold the face of another woman. Nor did he--overwhelming  temptation being absent: he was the most driven man in the United  States, with no time to run about after women, had such been his  proclivity; and his romantic temperament, having found high satisfaction  in his courtship and marriage with one of the most bewitching and  notable girls in America, was smothered under a mountain of work and  domestic bliss. So, although well aware that his will must perish at  times in the blaze of his passions, he was iron against the temptation  that held itself sufficiently aloof. To an extreme point he was master  of himself. He knew that it would be no whirlwind and forgetting with  this mysterious woman, who had set the town talking, and yet whose  social talents were so remarkable that she managed women as deftly as  she did men, and was a welcome guest in many of the most exclusive  houses in New York; the men were careful to do none of their gossiping  at home, and the women, although they criticised, and vowed themselves  scandalized, succumbed to her royal command of homage and her air of  proud invincibility. That she loved him, he had reason to know, and  although he regarded it as a young woman's romantic passion for a public  man focussing the attention of the country, and whom, from pressure of  affairs, it was almost impossible to meet, still the passion existed,  and, considering her beauty and talents, was too likely to communicate  itself to the object, were he rash enough to create the opportunity.  Hamilton's morals were the morals of his day,--a day when aristocrats  were libertines, receiving as little censure from society as from their  own consciences. His Scotch foundations had religious shoots in their  grassy crevices, but religion in a great mind like Hamilton's is an  emotional incident, one of several passions which act independently of  each other. He avoided temptation, not because he desired to shun a  torment of conscience or an accounting with his Almighty,--to Whom he  was devoted,--but because he was satisfied with the woman he had married  and would have sacrificed his ambitions rather than deliberately cause  her unhappiness. Had she been jealous and eloquent, it is more than  probable that his haughty intolerance of restraint would have driven him  to assert the pleasure of his will, but she was only amused at his  occasional divagations, and had no thought of looking for meanings which  might terrify her. He was quite conscious of his good fortune and too  well balanced to risk its loss. So Mrs. Croix might be driven to rest  her hopes on a trick of chance or a <i>coup de theatre</i>. But she was a  very clever woman; and she was not unlike Hamilton in a quite phenomenal  precocity, and in the torrential nature of her passions.    
Having a considerable knowledge of women and some of Mrs. Croix, he  inferred that sooner or later she would cease to conceal the light of  her endeavour. Nevertheless, he was taken aback to receive one day a  parcel, which, in the seclusion of his room, he found to contain a  dainty scented handkerchief, the counterpart of the one hidden in the  tree by the post road.    
"Can she have put it there on purpose?" he thought. "Did she take for  granted that I would pause to admire the scenery, and that I would  recognize the perfume of her violets? Gad! she's deeper than I thought  if that be true. The wider the berth, the better!"    
He gave no sign, and, as he had expected, a note arrived in due course.  It ran:--    <blockquote>
 THE MAPLES, 8th July--4 in the morning.    
 DEAR SIR: I fear I am a woman of little purpose, for I intended to   flit here like a swallow and as noiselessly flit again,   accomplishing a political trifle for you meanwhile, of which you   never should be the wiser. But alas! I am tormented by the idea   that you never <i>will</i> know, that in this great crisis of your   career, you think me indifferent when I understand so well your   terrible anxieties, your need for stupendous exertion, and all that   this convention means to this great country and to yourself; and   heart and soul and brain, at the risk of my popularity,--that I   love, sir,--and of a social position grudgingly acquired me, but   which I demand by right of an inheritance of which the world knows   less than of my elevation by Colonel Croix,--at the risk of all, I   am here and working for you. Perhaps I love power. Perhaps this   country with its strange unimaginable future. Perhaps I merely love   politics, which you have glorified--perhaps--well, when we do meet,   sir, you will avoid me no longer. Do you find me lacking in pride?   Reflect how another woman would have pursued you with love-letters,   persecuted you. I have exercised a restraint that has left its   mark, not only out of pride for myself, but out of a deep   understanding of your multitude of anxieties and interests; nor   should I dare to think of you at all were I not so sure of my power   to help you--now and always. Think, sir, of what such a   partnership--of which the world should never be cognizant--would   mean. I purpose to have a <i>salon</i>, and it shall be largely composed   of your enemies. Not a secret but that shall yield to me, not a   conspiracy but that you shall be able to forestall in time. I   believe that I was born devoted to your interests. Heart and soul I   shall be devoted to them as long as I live, and whether I am   permitted to know you or not. I could ruin you if I chose. I feel   that I have the power within me even for that. But God forbid! I   should have gone mad first. But ask yourself, sir, if I could not   be of vital assistance to your career, did we work in common. And   ask yourself other things--and truthfully. E.C.C    
 P.S. In a meeting held here last night the two generals poured   vials of their own molten iron into the veins of the rank and file,   belted them together in a solid bunch, vowed that you were a dealer   in the black arts and reducing them to knaves and fools. Their   words sank, no doubt of that. But I uprooted them, and blew them   away. For I professed to be seized with an uncontrollable fit of   laughter at the nonsense of forty-seven men--<i>the flower of the   State</i>--terrified of a bare third, and of a man but just in his   thirties. I rapidly recounted your failures in your first Congress,   dwelling on them, harping on them; and then I stood up like a   Chorus, and proclaimed the victories of C's career. C, who had   scowled when I went off into hysterics, almost knelt over my hand   at parting; and the rest departed secure in your fancied destiny,   their waxen brains ready for your clever fingers. At least you will   acknowledge the receipt of this, sir? Conceive my anxiety till I   know it has not fallen into the wrong hands!</blockquote>    
A messenger brought the note directly after breakfast, and Hamilton  hastily retreated with it to the privacy of his room. His horse awaited  him, but he read the epistle no less than four times. Once he moved  uneasily, and once he put his hand to his neck as if he felt a silken  halter. He smiled, but his face flushed deeply. Her bait, her veiled  threat, affected him little. But all that was unsaid pulled him like a  powerful magnet. He struggled for fully twenty minutes with the  temptation to ride to that paradise on the hill as fast as his horse  would carry him. But although he usually got into mischief when absent  from Betsey, contradictorily he was fonder of his wife when she was  remote; moreover, her helplessness appealed to him, and he rejected the  idea of deliberate disloyalty, even while his pulses hammered and the  spirit of romance within him moved turbulently in its long sleep. He  glanced out of the window. Beyond the tree-tops gleamed the river; above  were the hills, with their woods and grassy intervals. It was an  exquisite country, green and primeval; a moderate summer, the air warm  but electric. The nights were magnificent. Hamilton dreamed for a time,  then burned the letter in a fit of angry impatience.    
"I have nothing better to do!" he thought. "Good God!"    
An answer was imperative. He took a long ride first, however, then  scrawled a few hasty lines, as if he had found just a moment in which to  read her letter, but thanking her warmly for her interest and  information; ending with a somewhat conscience-stricken hope for the  instructive delight of her personal acquaintance when he should find the  leisure to be alive once more. So rested the matter for a time.
