  The light from the door that was always open illumined the room. The  rising sun must have struck full upon it, because it was almost as  bright as day there. Slade was in his butternut uniform, and his rifle  leaned against the wall. Now that he had made the slight opening Dick  could understand their words.
  &#8220;There are spies within Vicksburg, sir,&#8221; said Slade. &#8220;Colonel Dustin  detected one last night, but in the darkness he escaped down this  ravine. The alarm was spread and he could not have got outside our  lines. I must catch him. It will be a credit to me to do so. I was  under your command, and, although not in active service owing to your  wound, your word will go far. I want you to get me an order to search  every house or place in which he could hide.&#8221;
  &#8220;Not too much zeal, my worthy Slade. Talleyrand said that, but you  never heard of him. Excessive suspicion is not a good thing. It was  your chief fault as an overseer, although I willingly pay tribute to  your energy and attention to detail. This business of hunting spies is  greatly overdone. The fate of Vicksburg will be settled by the cannon  and the rifles.&#8221;
  &#8220;But, sir, they can do us great harm.&#8221;
  &#8220;Listen to that, my good Slade.&#8221;
  The deep booming note of the distant cannon entered the cave.
  &#8220;That is the sound of Grant's guns. He can fight better with those  weapons than with spies.&#8221;
  But Slade persisted, and Colonel Woodville, with an occasional word  from his daughter, fenced with him, always using a light bantering  tone, while the lad who lay so near listened, his pulses beating hard  in his temples and throat.
  &#8220;Your vigilance is to be commended, my good Slade,&#8221; Dick heard  Colonel Woodville say, &#8220;but to-day at least I cannot secure such a  commission for you from General Pemberton. We hear that Grant is  massing his troops for a grand attack, and there is little time to  thresh up all our own quarters for spies. We must think more of our  battle line. To-morrow we may have a plan. Come back to me then, and we  will talk further on these matters.&#8221;
  &#8220;But think, sir, what a day may cost us!&#8221;
  &#8220;You show impatience, not to say haste, Slade, and little is ever  achieved by thoughtless haste. The enemy is closing in upon us, and it  must be our chief effort to break his iron ring. Ah, here is my nephew!  He may give us further news on these grave matters.&#8221;
  Dick saw the entrance darken for a moment, then lighten again, and  that gallant youth, Victor Woodville, with whom he had fought so good a  fight, stood in the room. He was still pale and he carried his left arm  in a sling, but it was evident that his recovery from his wound had  been rapid. Dick saw the stern face of the old colonel brighten a bit,  while the tender smile curved again about the thin lips of the  spinster.
  Young Woodville gave a warm greeting to his uncle and elderly  cousin, and nodded to Slade. Dick believed from his gesture that he did  not like the guerilla leader, or at least he hoped so.
  &#8220;Victor,&#8221; said the colonel, &#8220;what word do you bring?&#8221;
  &#8220;Grant is advancing his batteries, and they seem to be massing for  attack. It will surely come in a day or two.&#8221;
  &#8220;As I thought. Then we shall need all our energies for immediate  battle. And now, Mr. Slade, as I said before, I will see you again  to-morrow about the matter of which we were speaking. I am old,  wounded, and I grow weary. I would rest.&#8221;
  Slade rose to go. He was not a pleasant sight. His clothes were  soiled and stained, and his face was covered with ragged beard. The  eyes were full of venom and malice.
  &#8220;Good day, Colonel Woodville,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I feel that I must  bring the matter up again. As a scout and leader of irregulars for the  Confederacy. I must be active in order to cope with the enemy's own  scouts and spies. I shall return early to-morrow morning.&#8221;
  Colonel Woodville waved his hand and Slade, bowing, withdrew.
  &#8220;Why was he so persistent, Uncle Charles?&#8221; asked Victor. &#8220;He seemed  to have some underlying motive.&#8221;
  &#8220;He always has such a motive, Victor. He is a man who suspects  everybody because he knows everybody has a right to suspect him. He may  even have been suspecting me, his old, and, I fear, too generous  employer. He has a mania about a spy hidden somewhere in Vicksburg.&#8221;
  Young Victor Woodville laughed gayly.
  &#8220;What folly,&#8221; he said, &#8220;for your old overseer, a man of Northern  origin to boot, to suspect you, of all men, of helping a Yankee in any  way. Why, Uncle Charles, everybody knows that you'd annihilate 'em if  you could, and that you were making good progress with the task until  you got that wound.&#8221;
  Colonel Woodville drew his great, white eyebrows together in his  characteristic way.
  &#8220;I admit, Victor, that I'm the prince of Yankee haters,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;They've ruined me, and if they succeed they'll ruin our state and the  whole South, too. We've fled for refuge to a hole in the ground, and  yet they come thundering at the door of so poor an abode. Listen!&#8221;
  They heard plainly the far rumble of the cannon. The intensity of  the fire increased with the growing day. Shells and bombs were falling  rapidly on Vicksburg. The face of Colonel Woodville darkened and the  eyes under the white thatch burned.
  &#8220;Nevertheless, Victor,&#8221; he said, &#8220;hate the Yankees as I do, and I  hate them with all my heart and soul, there are some things a gentleman  cannot do.&#8221;
  &#8220;What for instance, Uncle?&#8221;
  &#8220;He cannot break faith. He cannot do evil to those who have done  good to him. He must repay benefits with benefits. He cannot permit the  burden of obligation to remain upon him. Go to the door, Victor, and  see if any one is lurking there.&#8221;
  Young Woodville went to the entrance and returned with word that no  one was near.
  &#8220;Victor,&#8221; resumed Colonel Woodville, &#8220;this man Slade, who was so  preposterously wrong, this common overseer from the hostile section  which seeks with force to put us down, this miserable fellow who had  the presumption to suspect me, lying here with a wound, received in the  defense of the Confederacy, was nevertheless right.&#8221;
  Victor stared, not understanding, and Colonel Woodville raised  himself a little higher on his pillows.
  &#8220;Since when,&#8221; he asked of all the world, &#8220;has a Woodville refused to  pay his debts? Since when has a Woodville refused asylum to one who  protected him and his in the hour of danger? Margaret, lift the blanket  and invite our young friend in.&#8221;
  Dick was on his feet in an instant, and came into the chamber,  uttering thanks to the man who, in spite of so much bitterness against  his cause, could yet shelter him.
  Young Woodville exclaimed in surprise.
  &#8220;The Yankee with whom I fought at Bellevue!&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;And the one who ignored your presence at Jackson,&#8221; said Miss  Woodville.
  The two lads shook hands.
  &#8220;And now,&#8221; said Colonel Woodville, his old sharpness returning, &#8220;we  shall be on even terms, young sir. Your uniform bears a faint  resemblance to that of your own army, and Slade, cunning and cruel, may  have had you shot as a spy. You would be taken within our lines and  this is no time for long examinations.&#8221;
  &#8220;I know how much I owe you, sir,&#8221; said Dick, &#8220;and I know how much  danger my presence here brings upon you. I will leave as soon as the  ravine is clear. The gathering of the troops for battle will give me a  chance.&#8221;
  &#8220;You will do nothing of the kind. Having begun the task we will  carry it through. Our cave home rambles. There is a little apartment  belonging to Victor, in which you may put yourself in shape. I advise  you to lie quiet here for a day or two, and then if I am still able to  put my hand on you I may turn you over with full explanations to the  authorities.&#8221;
  Dick noted the significance of the words, &#8220;if I am still able to put  my hand on you,&#8221; but he merely spoke of his gratitude and went with  young Woodville into the little apartment. It was on the right side of  the hall, and a round shutterless hole opened into the ravine,  admitting light and air. The &#8220;window,&#8221; which was not more than a foot  in diameter faced toward the east and gave a view of earthworks, and  the region beyond, where the Union army stood.
  The room itself contained but little, a cot, some blankets,  clothing, and articles of the toilet.
  &#8220;Mason,&#8221; said Woodville, &#8220;make yourself as comfortable as you can  here. I did not know until I escaped from Jackson that it was you who  ignored my presence there. You seem in some manner to have won the good  opinion of my uncle, and, in any event, he could not bear to remain in  debt to a Yankee. If you're careful you're safe here for the day,  although you may be lonesome. I must go at once to our lines. Cousin  Margaret will bring you something to eat.&#8221;
  They shook hands again.
  &#8220;I can't do much fighting,&#8221; said Woodville, &#8220;owing to this wounded  arm of mine, but I can carry messages, and the line is so long many are  to be taken.&#8221;
  He went out and Miss Woodville came soon with food on a tray. Dick  suspected that they could ill spare it, but he must eat and he feared  to offer pay. It embarrassed him, too, that she should wait upon him,  but, in their situation, it was absolutely necessary that she do so,  even were there a servant somewhere, which he doubted. But she left the  tray, and when she returned for it an hour later she had only a few  words to say.
  Dick stood at the round hole that served as a window. There were  bushes about it, and, at that point, the cliff seemed to be almost  perpendicular. He was safe from observation and he looked over a vast  expanse of country. The morning was dazzlingly clear, and he saw  sections of the Confederate earthworks with their men and guns, and far  beyond them other earthworks and other guns, which he knew were those  of his own people.
  While he stood there alone, free from the tension that had lasted  while Slade was present, he realized the great volume of fire that the  Northern cannon were pouring without ceasing upon Vicksburg. The deep  rumble was continually in his ears, and at times his imagination made  the earth shake. He saw two shells burst in the air, and a shattering  explosion told that a third struck near by. To the eastward smoke was  always drifting. The Southern cannon seldom replied.
  He resolved to attempt escape during the coming night. It hurt him  to bring danger upon the Woodvilles and he wished, too, to fulfill his  mission. Others, beyond question, would reach the fleet with the  message, but he wished to reach it also.
  Yet nothing new occurred during all the long day. Miss Woodville  brought him more food at noon, but scarcely spoke. Then he returned to  the hole in the cliff, and remained there until twilight. Young  Woodville came, and he gathered from his manner that there had been no  important movement of the armies, that all as yet was preparation. But  he inferred that the storm was coming, and he told Victor that he meant  to leave that night.
  He was opposed vehemently. The line of Southern sentinels watched  everywhere. Slade was most vigilant. He might come at any time into the  ravine. No, he must wait. The next night, perhaps, but in any event he  must remain a while.
  Nor did he depart the next night either. Instead, two or three days  passed, and he was still in the house dug in the hillside, a guest and  yet a captive. The bombardment had gone on, his food was still brought  to him by Miss Woodville, and once or twice Victor came, but Dick, as  he was in honor bound, asked him no question about the armies.
  The waiting, the loneliness and the suspense were terrible to one so  young, and so ambitious. And yet he had fared better than he had a  right to expect, a fact, however, that did not relieve his situation.
  Another night came, and he went to sleep in his lonely cell in the  wall, but he was awakened while it was yet intensely dark by a  cannonade far surpassing in violence any that had gone before. He  rushed to the hole, but he could see nothing in the ravine. Yet the  whole plateau seemed to shake with the violence of the concussions and  the crash of exploding shells.
  The fire came from all sides, from the river as well as the land.  The boom of the huge mortars on the boats there sounded above  everything. Dick knew absolutely now that the message he was to carry  had been delivered by somebody else.
  He heard under the continued thunder of the guns sharp commands, and  the tread of many troops moving. He knew that the Southern forces were  going into position, and he felt himself that the tremendous fire was  the prelude to a great attack. His excitement grew. He strained his  eyes, but he could see nothing in the dark ravine, or out there where  the cannon roared, save the rapid, red flashes under the dim horizon.  He had his watch and he had kept it running. Now he was able to make  out that it was only three o'clock in the morning. A long time until  day and he must wait until then to know what such a furious convulsion  would achieve.
  The slow time passed, and there was no decrease of the fire. Once or  twice he came away from the window and listened at the entrance to his  little room, but he could hear nothing stirring in the larger chamber.  Yet it was incredible that Colonel Woodville and his daughter should  not be awake. They would certainly be listening with an anxiety and  suspense not less than his.
  Dawn came after painful ages, and slowly the region out there where  the Union army lay rose into the light. But it was a red dawn, a dawn  in flame and smoke. Scores of guns crashed in front, and behind the  heavy booming of the mortars on the boats formed the overnote of the  storm.
  The opening was not large, but it afforded the lad a good view, and  he thrust his head out as far as he could, every nerve in him leaping  at the deep roar of the cannonade. He had no doubt that the assault was  about to be made. He was wild with eagerness to see it, and it was a  cruel hurt to his spirit that he was held there, and could not take a  part in it.
  He thought of rushing from the place, and of seeking a way through  the lines to his own army, but a little reflection showed him that it  would be folly. He must merely be a witness, while Colonel Winchester,  Warner, Pennington, the sergeant, Colonel Hertford, all whom he knew  and the tens of thousands whom he did not know, fought the battle.
  A tremendous sound, distant and steady, would not blot out much  smaller sounds nearby, and now he heard noises in the larger chamber.  The voice of Colonel Woodville was raised in sharp command.
  &#8220;Lift me up!&#8221; he said, &#8220;I must see! Must I lie here, eating my soul  out, when a great battle is going on! Help me up, I say! Wound or no  wound, I will go to the door!&#8221;
  Then the voice of Miss Woodville attempting to soothe was heard, but  the colonel broke forth more furiously than ever, not at her, but at  his unhappy fate.
  Dick, spurred by impulse, left his alcove and entered the room.
  &#8220;Sir,&#8221; he said respectfully to Colonel Woodville, &#8220;you are eager to  see, and so am I. May I help you?&#8221;
  Colonel Woodville turned a red eye upon him.
  &#8220;Young man,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have shown before a sense of fitness, and  your appearance now is most welcome. You shall help me to the door, and  I will lean upon you. Together we will see what is going to happen,  although I wish for one result, and you for another. No, Margaret, it  is not worth while to protest any further. My young Yankee and I will  manage it very well between us.&#8221;
  Miss Woodville stepped aside and smiled wanly.
  &#8220;I think it is best, Miss Woodville,&#8221; Dick said in a low tone.
  &#8220;Perhaps,&#8221; she replied.
  Colonel Woodville impatiently threw off the cover. He wore a long  purple dressing gown, and his wound was in the leg, but it was partly  healed. Dick helped him out of the bed and then supported him with his  arm under his shoulder. Within that singular abode the roar of the guns  was a steady and sinister mutter, but beneath it now appeared another  note.
  Colonel Woodville had begun to swear. It was not the torrent of loud  imprecation that Dick had heard in Jackson, but subdued, and all the  more fierce because it was so like the ferocious whine of a powerful  and hurt wild animal. Swearing was common enough among the older men of  the South, even among the educated, but Colonel Woodville now surpassed  them all.
  Dick heard oaths, ripe and rich, entirely new to him, and he heard  the old ones in new arrangements and with new inflections. And yet  there was no blasphemy about it. It seemed a part of time and place,  and, what was more, it seemed natural coming from the lips of the old  colonel.
  They reached the door, the cut in the side of the ravine, and at  once a wide portion of the battlefield sprang into the light, while the  roar of the guns was redoubled. Dick would have stepped back now, but  Colonel Woodville's hand rested on his shoulder and his support was  needed.
  &#8220;My glasses, Margaret!&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;I must see! I will see!  If I am but an old hound, lying here while the pack is in full cry, I  will nevertheless see the chase! And even if I am an old hound I could  run with the best of them if that infernal Yankee bullet had not taken  me in the leg!&#8221;
  Miss Woodville brought him the glasses, a powerful pair, and he  glued them instantly to his eyes. Dick saw only the field of battle,  dark lines and blurs, the red flare of cannon and rifle fire, and  towers and banks of smoke, but the colonel saw individual human beings,  and, with his trained military eye, he knew what the movements meant.  Dick felt the hand upon his shoulder trembling with excitement. He was  excited himself. Miss Woodville stood just behind them, and a faint  tinge of color appeared in her pale face.
  &#8220;The Yankees are getting ready to charge,&#8221; said the colonel. &#8220;At the  point we see they will not yet rush forward. They will, of course, wait  for a preconcerted signal, and then their whole army will attack at  once. But the woods and ravines are filled with their skirmishers,  trying to clear the way. I can see them in hundreds and hundreds, and  their rifles make sheets of flame. All the time the cannon are firing  over their heads. Heavens, what a bombardment! I've never before  listened to its like!&#8221;
  &#8220;What are our troops doing, father?&#8221; asked Miss Woodville.
  &#8220;Very little yet, and they should do little. Pemberton is showing  more judgment than I expected of him. The defense should hold its fire  until the enemy is well within range and that's what we're doing!&#8221;
  The colonel leaned a little more heavily upon him, but Dick steadied  himself. The old man still kept the glasses to his eyes, and swept them  back and forth in as wide an arc as their position permitted. The hills  shook with the thunder of the cannon, and the brilliant sun, piercing  through the smoke, lighted up the vast battle line.
  &#8220;The attack of the skirmishers grows hotter,&#8221; said the old man. &#8220;The  thickets blaze with the fire of their rifles. Heavy masses of infantry  are moving forward. Now they stop and lie on their arms. They are  awaiting the word from other parts of the field, and it shows with  certainty that a grand attack is coming. Two batteries of eight guns  each have come nearer. I did not think it possible for the fire of  their cannon to increase, but it has done so. Young sir, would you care  to look through the glasses?&#8221;
  &#8220;I believe not, Colonel. I will trust to the naked eye and your  report.&#8221;
  It was an odd feeling that made Dick decline the glasses. If he  looked he must tell to the others what he saw, and he wished to show  neither exultation nor depression. The colonel, the duty of courtesy  discharged, resumed his own position of witness and herald.
  &#8220;The columns of infantry are getting up again,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see a  man in what I take to be a general's uniform riding along their front.  He must be making a speech. No doubt he knows the desperate nature of  the attack, and would inspire them. Now he is gone and other officers,  colonels and majors are moving about.&#8221;
  &#8220;What are the skirmishers doing, Colonel?&#8221;
  &#8220;Their fire is not so hot. They must be drawing back. They have made  the prelude, and the importance of their role has passed. The masses of  infantry are drawing together again. Now I see men on horseback with  trumpets to their lips. Yes, the charge is coming. Ah-h! That burnt  them!&#8221;
  There was a terrific crash much nearer, and Dick knew that it was  the Southern batteries opening fire. The shoulder upon which the  colonel's hand rested shook a little, but it was from excitement. He  said nothing and Colonel Woodville continued:
  &#8220;The smoke is so heavy I can't see what damage was done! Now it has  cleared away! There are gaps in the Yankee lines, but the men have  closed up, and they come on at the double quick with their cannon still  firing over their heads!&#8221;
  In his excitement he took his hand off Dick's shoulder and leaned  forward a little farther, supporting himself now against the earthen  wall. Dick stood just behind him, shielded from the sight of any one  who might be passing in the ravine, although there was little danger  now from searchers with a great battle going on. Meanwhile he watched  the combat with an eagerness fully equal to that of the old colonel.
  The mighty crash of cannon and rifles together continued, but for a  little while the smoke banked up in front so densely that the whole  combat was hidden from them. Then a wind slowly rolled the smoke away.  The figures of the men began to appear like shadowy tracery, and then  emerged, distinct and separate from the haze.
  &#8220;They are nearer now,&#8221; said the Colonel. &#8220;I can plainly see their  long lines moving and their light guns coming with them. But our  batteries are raking them horribly. Their men are falling by the scores  and hundreds.&#8221;
  Miss Woodville uttered a deep sigh and turned her face away. But she  looked again in a few moments. The terrible spell was upon her, too.
  Dick's nerves were quivering. His heart was with the assailants and  theirs with the assailed, but he would not speak aloud against the  hopes of Colonel Woodville and his daughter, since he was in their  house, such as it was, and, in a measure, under their protection.
  &#8220;Their charge is splendid,&#8221; continued the colonel, &#8220;and I hope  Pemberton has made full use of the ground for defense! He will need all  the help he can get! Oh, to be out of the battle on such a day! The  smoke is in the way again and I can see nothing. Now it has passed and  the enemy is still advancing, but our fire grows hotter and hotter! The  shells and the grape and the canister and the bullets are smashing  through them. They cannot live under it! They must go back!&#8221;
  Nevertheless the blue lines came steadily toward the Southern  earthworks. Dick saw officers, some ahorse, and some afoot, rushing  about and encouraging the men, and he saw many fall and lie still while  the regiments passed on.
  &#8220;They are in the nearer thickets,&#8221; cried the colonel, &#8220;and now  they're climbing the slopes! Ah, you riflemen, your target is there!&#8221;
  The Northern army was so near now that the Southern rifle fire was  beating upon it like a storm. Never flinching, the men of the west and  northwest hurled themselves upon the powerful fortified positions. Some  reached shelves of the plateau almost at the mouths of the guns and  hung there, their comrades falling dead or dying around them, but now  the rebel yell began to swell along the vast line, and reached the ears  of those in the ravine.
  &#8220;The omen of victory!&#8221; exclaimed the colonel exultantly. &#8220;Our brave  lads feel that they're about to triumph! Grant can't break through our  line! Why doesn't he call off his men? It's slaughter!&#8221;
  Dick's heart sank. He knew that the colonel's words were true. The  Southern army, posted in its defenses, was breaking the ring of steel  that sought to crush it to death. Groups of men in blue who had seized  ground in the very front of the defenses either died there or were  gradually driven back. The inner ring along its front of miles  thundered incessantly on the outer ring, and repelled every attempt to  crush it.
  &#8220;They yield,&#8221; said the colonel, after a long time. &#8220;The Northern  fire has sunk at many points, and there! and there! they're retreating!  The attack has failed and the South has won a victory!&#8221;
  &#8220;But Grant will come again,&#8221; said Dick, speaking his opinion for the  first time.
  &#8220;No doubt of it,&#8221; said Colonel Woodville, &#8220;but likely he will come  to the same fate.&#8221;
  He spoke wholly without animosity. The battle now died fast. The men  in gray had been invincible. Their cannon and rifles had made an  impenetrable barrier of fire, and Grant, despite the valor of his  troops, had been forced to draw off. Many thousands had fallen and the  Southern generals were exultant. Johnston would come up, and Grant,  having such heavy losses, would be unable to withstand the united  Confederate armies.
  But Grant, as Colonel Woodville foresaw, had no idea of retreating.  Fresh troops were pouring down the great river for him, and while he  would not again attempt to storm Vicksburg, the ring of steel around it  would be made so broad and strong that Pemberton could not get out nor  could Johnston get in.
  When the last cannon shot echoed over the far hills Colonel  Woodville turned away from the door of his hillside home.
  &#8220;I must ask your shoulder again, young sir,&#8221; he said to Dick. &#8220;What  I have seen rejoices me greatly, but I do not say it to taunt you. In  war if one wins the other must lose, and bear in mind that you are the  invader.&#8221;
  &#8220;May I help you back to your bed, sir?&#8221; asked Dick.
  &#8220;You may. You are a good young man. I'm glad I saved you from that  scoundrel, Slade. As the score between us is even I wish that you were  out of Vicksburg and with your own people.&#8221;
  &#8220;I was thinking, too, sir, that I ought to go. I may take a quick  departure.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then if you do go I wish you a speedy and safe journey, but I tell  you to beware of one, Slade, who has a malicious heart and a long  memory.&#8221;
  Dick withdrew to his own cell, as he called it, and he passed bitter  hours there. The repulse had struck him a hard blow. Was it possible  that Grant could not win? And if he could not win what terrible risks  he would run in the heart of the Confederacy, with perhaps two armies  to fight! He felt that only the Mississippi, that life-line connecting  him with the North, could save him.
  But as dusk came gradually in the ravine he resolved that he would  go. His supper, as usual, was brought to him by Miss Woodville. She was  as taciturn as ever, speaking scarcely a half-dozen words. When he  asked her if Victor had gone through the battle unharmed she merely  nodded, and presently he was alone again, with the dusk deepening in  the great gully.
  Dick was confident that nobody but Colonel Woodville, his daughter,  and himself were in the cave-home. It was but a small place, and new  callous places on her hands indicated that she was doing the cooking  and all other work. His resolve to risk everything and go was  strengthened.
  He waited patiently until the full night had come and only the usual  sounds of an army in camp arose. Then he made ready. He had surrendered  his holster and pistols to Colonel Woodville, and so he must issue  forth unarmed, but it could not be helped. He had several ten dollar  gold pieces in his pocket, and he put one of them on the tiny table in  his cell. He knew that it would be most welcome, and he could not  calculate how many hundreds in Confederacy currency it was worth. He  was glad that he could repay a little at least.
  Then he stepped lightly toward the larger chamber in which Colonel  Woodville lay. The usual candle was burning on the table near his bed,  but the great bald head lay motionless on the pillow, and the heavy  white eyebrows drooped over closed lids. Sound asleep! Dick was glad of  it. The colonel, with his strong loyalty to the South, might seek to  hold him, at least as his personal prisoner, and now the trouble was  avoided.
  He moved gently across the floor, and then passed toward the open  door. How good that puff of fresh air and freedom felt on his face! He  did not know that Colonel Woodville raised his head on the pillow,  glanced after him, and then let his head sink back and his eyes close  again. A low sigh came between the colonel's lips, and it would have  been difficult to say whether it was relief or regret.
  Dick stepped into the narrow path cut in the side of the ravine and  inhaled more draughts of the fresh air. How sweet and strong it was!  How it filled one's lungs and brought with it life, courage and  confidence! One had to live in a hole in a hill before he could  appreciate fully the blessed winds that blew about the world. He knew  that the path ran in front of other hollows dug in the earth, and he  felt sorry for the people who were compelled to burrow in them. He felt  sorry, in truth, for all Vicksburg, because now that he was outside his  fears for Grant disappeared, and he knew that he must win.
  While he remained in the path a deep boom came from the direction of  the Union army and a huge shell burst over the town. It was followed in  a moment by another and then by many others. While the besieged  rejoiced in victory the besiegers had begun anew the terrible  bombardment, sending a warning that the iron ring still held.
  Dick paused no longer, but ran rapidly along the path until he  emerged upon the open plateau and proceeded toward the center of the  town. He judged that in the hours following a great battle, while there  was yet much confusion, he would find his best chance.
  He had reckoned rightly. There was a great passing to and fro in  Vicksburg, but its lights were dim. Oil and candles alike were scarce,  and there was little but the moon's rays to disclose a town to the eye.  The rejoicings over the victory had brought more people than usual into  the streets, but the same exultation made them unsuspicious, and Dick  glided among them in the dusk, almost without fear.
  He had concluded that &#8220;the longest way around was the shortest way  through,&#8221; and he directed his steps toward the river. He had formed a  clear plan at last, and he believed that it would succeed. Twisting and  turning, always keeping in the shadows, he made good progress,  descended the bluff, and at last stood behind the ruins of an old  warehouse near the stream.
  Southern batteries were not far away from him and he heard the men  talking. Then, strengthening his resolution, he came from behind the  ruins, flung himself almost flat on the ground, and crawled toward the  river, pushing in front of him a board, which some Northern gun had  shot from the warehouse.
  He knew that his task was difficult and dangerous, though in the  last resort he could rush to the water and spring in. But he was almost  at the edge before any sentinel saw the black shadow passing over the  ground.
  A hail came, and Dick flattened himself against the ground and lay  perfectly still. Evidently the sentinel was satisfied that his fancy  had been making merry with him, as he did not look further at the  shadow, and Dick, after waiting two or three minutes, resumed his slow  creeping.
  He reached the edge, shoved the board into it, and dropped gently  into the water beside it, submerged to the head. Then, pushing his  support before him, he struck out for the middle of the stream.
