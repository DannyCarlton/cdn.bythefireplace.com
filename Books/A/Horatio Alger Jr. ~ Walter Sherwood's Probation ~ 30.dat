  Walter had hardly time to consider what to do in the light of the   discovery he had made before the matter was taken out of his hands. 
  &quot;Young feller, you'd better get off that hoss!&quot; fell on his ears in  a  rough voice. 
  He turned, and saw two stalwart men eyeing him suspiciously. 
  &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Walter earnestly, &quot;till I read this notice I had  no  idea that the horse was stolen.&quot; 
  &quot;That's neither here nor there. You'd better get off the hoss.&quot; 
  Walter felt that this was a command, and obeyed at once. 
  &quot;Very well, gentlemen,&quot; he said. &quot;I will leave the horse in your   hands, and depend upon you to return it to the owner.&quot; 
  As Walter spoke he turned to walk off, but the man who had first   accosted him got in his way. 
  &quot;I don't want to have any trouble with you, sir. Please get out of  my  way, and let me go.&quot; 
  &quot;Not by a long shot.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you propose to do with me?&quot; 
  &quot;Take you to the lockup.&quot; 
  Walter was now really alarmed. 
  &quot;You'll have to go with us, young feller!&quot; said Crane. 
  &quot;And leave the hoss?&quot; asked Penton. &quot;We'd ought to take charge of  it,  and get the reward.&quot; 
  &quot;That's so, Penton. You go and get a constable. We'll stand by the   hoss.&quot; 
  Penton hurried off, and returned shortly with a constable in  uniform. 
  &quot;What's up?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;This young feller's rid into town with Colonel Richard Owen's  hoss.&quot; 
  &quot;But I'd ought to secure the hoss,&quot; said the constable, who felt  that  perhaps he might be entitled to the reward offered. 
  &quot;Look here, Cyrus Stokes, you secure the thief&#8212;that's your  lookout.&quot; 
  &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; said Walter, &quot;I object to being called a thief. I have   already told you I did not steal the horse.&quot; 
  The constable seized Walter by the arm and walked off with him. To  add  to his mortification, people whom they met on the street looked at  him  curiously.
