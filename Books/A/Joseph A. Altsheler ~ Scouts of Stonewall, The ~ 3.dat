  Harry took some orders to brigadiers and colonels.  He saw that   concentration was going on rapidly and he shared the belief of his   comrades that the army would march in the morning.  He felt a new  impulse  of ambition and energy.  It continually occurred to him that  while he was  doing much he might do more.  He saw how his leader  worked, with rapidity  and precision, and without excitement, and he  strove to imitate him. 
  The influence of Jackson was rapidly growing stronger upon the mind  of  the brilliant, sensitive boy, so susceptible to splendor of both  thought  and action.  The general, not yet great to the world, but  great already  to those around him, dominated the mind of the boy.   Harry was proud to  serve him. 
  He saw that Jackson had taken no sleep, and he would take none  either.  Soon the question was forgotten, and he toiled all through the  afternoon,  glad to be at the heart of affairs so important. 
  Winchester was a sprightly little city, one of the best in the  great  valley, inhabited by cultivated people of old families, and  Southern to  the core.  Harry and his young comrades had found a good  welcome there.  They had been in many houses and they had made many  friends.  The  Virginians liked his bright face and manners.  Now they  could not fail to  see that some great movement was afoot, and more  than once his new  friends asked him its nature, but he replied  truthfully that he did not  know.  In the throb of great action  Winchester disappeared from his  thoughts.  Every faculty was bent upon  the plans of Jackson, whatever  they might be. 
  The afternoon drew to a close and then the short winter twilight  passed  swiftly.  The last night of the Old Year had come, and Harry  was to enter  at dawn upon one of the most vivid periods in the life of  any boy that  ever lived, a period paralleled perhaps only by that of  the French lads  who followed the young Bonaparte into the plains of  Italy.  Harry with  all his dreams, arising from the enormous  impression made upon him by  Jackson, could not yet foresee what lay  before him. 
  He was returning on foot from one of his shorter errands.  He had  ridden  throughout the afternoon, but the time came when he thought the  horse  ought to rest, and with the coming of the twilight he had  walked.  He was not conscious of any weakness.  His body, in a way, had  become a  mere mechanism.  It worked, because the will acted upon it  like a spring,  but it was detached, separate from his mind.  He took  no more interest in  it than he would in any other machine, which, when  used up, could be cast  aside, and be replaced with a new one. 
  He glanced at the camp, stretching through the darkness.  Much  fewer  fires were burning than usual, and the men, warned to sleep  while they  could, had wrapped themselves already in their blankets.   Then he entered  the tent of Jackson with the reply to an order that  he had taken to a  brigadier. 
  The general stood by a wall of the tent, dictating to an aide who  sat at  the little table, and who wrote by the light of a small oil  lamp.  Harry saluted and gave him the reply.  Jackson read it.  As he  read Harry  staggered but recovered himself quickly.  The overtaxed  body was making a  violent protest, and the vague feeling that he could  throw away the old  and used-up machine, and replace it with a new one  was not true.  He  caught his breath sharply and his face was red with  shame.  He hoped that  his general had not seen this lamentable  weakness of his. 
  Jackson, after reading the reply, resumed his dictation.  Harry was  sure  that the general had not seen.  He had not noticed the weakness  in an  aide of his who should have no weakness at all!  But Jackson had  seen and  in a few hours of contact he had read the brave, bright young  soul of his  aide.  He finished the dictation and then turning to  Harry, he said  quietly: 
  &#8220;I can't think of anything more for you to do, Mr. Kenton, and I  suppose  you might as well rest.  I shall do so myself in a half hour.   You'll  find blankets in the large tent just beyond mine.  A half  dozen of my  aides sleep in it, but there are blankets enough for all  and it's first  come first served.&#8221; 
  Harry gave the usual military salute and withdrew.  Outside the  tent,  the body that he had used so cruelly protested not only a second  time but  many times.  It was in very fact and truth detached from the  will,  because it no longer obeyed the will at all.  His legs wobbled  and bent  like those of a paralytic, and his head fell forward through  very  weakness. 
  Luckily the tent was only a few yards away, and he managed to reach  it  and enter.  It had a floor of planks and in the dark he saw three  youths,  a little older than himself, already sound asleep in their  blankets.  He promptly rolled himself in a pair, stretched his length  against the  cloth wall, and balmy sleep quickly came to make a  complete reunion of  the will and of the tired body which would be  fresh again in the morning,  because he was young and strong and  recovered fast. 
  Harry slept hard all through the night and nature completed her  task of  restoring the worn fibers.  He was roused shortly after dawn  and the  cooks were ready with breakfast for the army.  He ate hungrily  and when  he would stop, one of his comrades who had slept with him in  the tent  told him to eat more. 
  &#8220;You need a lot to go on when you march with Jackson,&#8221; he said.   &#8220;Besides,  you won't be certain where the next is coming from.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've learned that already,&#8221; said Harry, as he took his advice. 
  A half hour later he was on his horse near Jackson, ready to  receive his  commands, and in the early hours of the New Year the army  marched out of  Winchester, the eager wishes of the whole population  following it. 
  It was the brightest of winter mornings, almost like spring it  seemed.  The sky was a curving and solid sheet of sunlight, and the  youths of the  army were for the moment a great and happy family.  They  were marching to  battle, wounds and death, but they were too young and  too buoyant to  think much about it. 
  Harry soon learned that they were going toward Bath and Hancock,  two  villages on the railway, both held by Northern troops.  He  surmised that  Jackson would strike a sudden blow, surprise the  garrisons, cut the  railway, and then rush suddenly upon some greater  force.  A campaign in  the middle of winter.  It appealed to him as  something brilliant and  daring.  The pulses which had beat hard so  often lately began to beat  hard again. 
  The army went swiftly across forest and fields.  As the brigade had   marched back the night before, so the whole army marched forward  to-day.  The fact that Jackson's men always marched faster than other  men was  forced again upon Harry's attention.  He remembered from his  reading an  old comment of Napoleon's referring to war that there were  only two or  three men in Europe who knew the value of time.  Now he  saw that at least  one man in America knew its value, and knew it as  fully as Napoleon ever  did. 
  The day passed hour by hour and the army sped on, making only a  short  halt at noon for rest and food.  Harry joined the Invincibles  for a few  moments and was received with warmth by Colonel Leonidas  Talbot,  Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire and all his old friends. 
  &#8220;I am sorry to lose you, Harry,&#8221; said Colonel Talbot, &#8220;but I am  glad that  you are on the immediate staff of General Jackson.  It's an  honor.  I feel already that we're in the hands of a great general, and  the  feeling has gone through the whole army.  There's an end, so far  as this  force is concerned, to doubt and hesitation.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And we, the Southerners who are called the cavaliers, are led by a   puritan,&#8221; said Lieutenant-Colonel St. Hilaire.  &#8220;Because if there ever   was a puritan, General Jackson is one.&#8221; 
  Harry passed on, intending to speak with his comrades, Langdon and   St. Clair.  He heard the young troops talking freely everywhere, never   forgetting the fact that they were born free citizens as good as  anybody,  and never hesitating to comment, often in an unflattering  way, upon their  officers.  Harry saw a boy who had just taken off his  shoes and who was  tenderly rubbing his feet. 
  &#8220;I never marched so fast before,&#8221; he said complainingly.  &#8220;My feet  are  sore all over.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Put on your shoes an' shut up,&#8221; said another boy.  &#8220;Stonewall  Jackson  don't care nothin' about your feet.  You're here to fight.&#8221; 
  Harry walked on, but the words sank deep in his mind.  It was an   uneducated boy, probably from the hills, who had given the rebuke,   but he saw that the character of Stonewall Jackson was already  understood  by the whole army, even to the youngest private.  He found  Langdon and  St. Clair sitting together on a log.  They were not tired,  as they were  mounted officers, but they were full of curiosity. 
  &#8220;What's passing through Old Jack's head?&#8221; asked Langdon, the  irreverent  and the cheerful. 
  &#8220;I don't know, and I don't suppose anybody will ever know all  that's  passing there.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'll wager my year's pay against a last year's bird nest that he  isn't  leading us away from the enemy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He certainly isn't doing that.  We're moving on two little towns,   Bath and Hancock, but there must be bigger designs beyond.&#8221; 
  &#8220;This is New Year's Day, as you know,&#8221; said St. Clair in his  pleasant  South Carolina drawl, &#8220;and I feel that Tom there is going to  earn the  year's pay that he talks so glibly about wagering.&#8221; 
  &#8220;At any rate, Arthur,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;if we go into battle you'll  be  dressed properly for it, and if you fall you'll die in a  gentleman's  uniform.&#8221; 
  St. Clair smiled, showing that he appreciated Langdon's flippant  comment.  Harry glanced at him.  His uniform was spotless, and it was  pressed as  neatly as if it had just come from the hands of a tailor.   The gray  jacket of fine cloth, with its rows of polished brass  buttons, was  buttoned as closely as that of a West Point cadet.  He  seemed to be in  dress and manner a younger brother of the gallant  Virginia captain,  Philip Sherburne, and Harry admired him.  A soldier  who dressed well amid  such trying obstacles was likely to be a soldier  through and through.  Harry was learning to read character from  extraneous things, things that  sometimes looked like trifles to  others. 
  &#8220;I merely came over here to pass the time of day,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;We  start  again in two or three minutes.  Hark, there go the bugles, and I  go with  them!&#8221; 
  He ran back, sprang on his horse a few seconds before Jackson  himself was  in the saddle, and rode away again. 
  The general sent him on no missions for a while, and Harry rode in   silence.  Observant, as always, he noticed the long ridges of the   mountains, showing blue in the distance, and the occasional glimmer of   water in the valley.  It was beautiful, this valley, and he did not   wonder that the Virginians talked of it so much.  He shared their  wrath  because the hostile Northern foot already pressed a portion, and  he felt  as much eagerness as they to drive away the invader. 
  He also saw pretty soon that the long lines of the mountains, so  blue and  beautiful against the shining sun, were losing their clear  and vivid  tints.  The sky above them was turning to gray, and their  crests were  growing pale.  Then a wind chill and sharp with the edge  of winter began  to blow down from the slopes.  It had been merely  playing at summer that  morning and, before the first day of January  1862, closed, winter rushed  down upon Virginia, bringing with it the  fiercest and most sanguinary  year the New World ever knew&#8212;save the  one that followed it, and the one  that followed that. 
  The temperature dropped many degrees in an hour.  Just as the young   troops of Grant, marching to Donelson, deceived by a warm morning had   cast aside their heavy clothing to be chilled to the bone before the  day  was over, so the equally young troops of Jackson now suffered in  the same  way, and from the same lack of thought. 
  Most of their overcoats and cloaks were in the wagons, and there  was no  time to get them, because Jackson would not permit any delays.   They  shivered and grumbled under their breath.  Nevertheless the army  marched  swiftly, while the dark clouds, laden with snow and cold,  marched up with  equal swiftness from the western horizon. 
  A winter campaign!  It did not seem so glorious now to many of the  boys  who in the warmth and the sunshine had throbbed with the thought  of it.  They inquired once more about those wagons containing their  overcoats and  blankets, and they learned that they had followed easier  roads, while the  troops themselves were taking short cuts through the  forests and across  the fields.  They might be reunited at night, and  they might not.  It was not considered a matter of the first importance  by Jackson. 
  Harry had been wise enough to retain his military cloak strapped to  his  saddle, and he wrapped it about his body, drawing the collar as  high as  he could.  One of his gauntleted hands held the reins, and the  other  swung easily by his side.  He would have given his cloak to some  one of  the shivering youths who marched on foot near him, but he knew  that  Jackson would not permit any such open breach of discipline. 
  The boy watched the leader who rode almost by his side.  Jackson  had put  on his own cavalry cloak, but it was fastened by a single  button at the  top and it had blown open.  He did not seem to notice  the fact.  Apparently he was oblivious of heat and cold alike, and rode  on, bent a  little forward in the saddle, his face the usual  impenetrable mask.  But Harry knew that the brain behind that brow  never ceased to work,  always thinking and planning, trying this  combination and that, ready to  make any sacrifice to do the work that  was to be done. 
  The long shadows came, and the short day that had turned so cold  was over,  giving way to the night that was colder than the day.  They  were on the  hills now and even the vigorous Jackson felt that it was  time to stop  until morning.  The night had turned very dark, a fierce  wind was blowing,  and now and then a fine sift of snow as sharp as  hail was blown against  their faces. 
  The wagons with the heavy clothing, blankets and food had not come  up,  and perhaps would not arrive until the next day.  Gloom as dark as  the  night itself began to spread among the young troops, but Jackson  gave  them little time for bemoaning their fate.  Fires were quickly  built from  fallen wood.  The men found warmth and a certain mental  relief in  gathering the wood itself.  The officers, many of them boys  themselves,  shared in the work.  They roamed through the forest  dragging in fallen  timber, and now and then, an old rail fence was  taken panel by panel to  join the general heap. 
  The fires presently began to crackle in the darkness, running in  long,  irregular lines, and the young soldiers crowded in groups about  them.  At the same time they ate the scanty rations they carried in  their  knapsacks, and wondered what had become of the wagons.  Jackson  sent  detachments to seek his supply trains, but Harry knew that he  would not  wait for it in the morning.  The horses drawing the heavy  loads over the  slippery roads would need rest as badly as the men, and  Jackson would go  on.  If food was not there&#8212;well then his troops must  march on empty  stomachs. 
  Youth changes swiftly and the high spirits with which the soldiers  had  departed in the morning were gone.  The night had become extremely  cold.  Fierce winds whistled down from the crests of the mountains and  pierced  their clothing with myriads of little icy darts.  They crept  closer and  closer to the fire.  Their faces burned while their backs  froze, and the  menacing wind, while it chilled them to the marrow with  its breath,  seemed to laugh at them in sinister fashion.  They thought  with many a  lament of their warm quarters in Winchester. 
  Harry shared the common depression to a certain extent.  He had  recalled  that morning how the young Napoleon started on his great  campaign of  Italy, and there had been in his mind some idea that it  would be repeated  in the Virginia valleys, but he recalled at night  that the soldiers of  the youthful Bonaparte had marched and fought in  warm days in a sunny  country.  It was a different thing to conduct a  great campaign, when the  clouds heavy with snow were hovering around  the mountain tops, and the  mercury was hunting zero.  He shivered and  looked apprehensively into the  chilly night.  His apprehension was not  for a human foe, but for the  unbroken spirits of darkness and mystery  that can cow us all. 
  No tents were pitched.  Jackson shared the common lot, sitting by a  fire  with some of the higher officers, while three or four other young  aides  were near.  The sifts of snow turned after a while into a fine  but steady  snow, which continued half an hour.  The backs of the  soldiers were  covered with white, while their faces burned.  Then  there was a shuffling  sound at every fire, as the men turned their  backs to the blaze and their  faces to the forest. 
  Harry watched General Jackson closely.  He was sitting on a fallen  log,  which the soldiers had drawn near to one of the largest fires,  and he was  staring intently into the coals.  He did not speak, nor did  he seem to  take any notice of those about him.  Harry knew, too, that  he was not  seeing the coals, but the armies of the enemy on the other  side of the  cold mountain. 
  Jackson after a while beckoned to the young aides and he gave to  every  one in turn the same command. 
  &#8220;Mount and make a complete circuit of the army.  Report to me  whether all  the pickets are watchful, and whether any signs of the  enemy can be seen.&#8221; 
  Harry had tethered his horse in a little grove near by, where he  might be  sheltered as much as possible from the cold, and the faithful  animal  which had not tasted food that day, whimpered and rubbed his  nose against  his shoulder when he came. 
  &#8220;I'm sorry, old boy,&#8221; whispered Harry, &#8220;I'd give you food if I  could,  but since I can't give you food I've got to give you more  work.&#8221; 
  He put on the bridle, leaped into the saddle, which had been left  on the  horse's back, and rode away on his mission.  The password that  night was  &#8220;Manassas,&#8221; and Harry exchanged it with the pickets who  curved in a great  circle through the lone, cold forest.  They were  always glad to see him.  They were alone, save when two of them met at  the common end of a beat,  and these youths of the South were friendly,  liking to talk and to hear  the news of others. 
  Toward the Northern segment of the circle he came to a young giant  from  the hills who was walking back and forth with the utmost vigor  and  shaking himself as if he would throw off the cold.  His brown face   brightened with pleasure when he saw Harry and exchanged the password. 
  &#8220;Two or three other officers have been by here ridin' hosses,&#8221; he  said in  the voice of an equal speaking to his equal, &#8220;an' they don't  fill me  plum' full o' envy a-tall, a-tall.  I guess a feller tonight  kin keep  warmer walkin' on the ground than ridin' on a hoss.  What  might your name  be, Mr. Officer?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Kenton.  I'm a lieutenant, at present on the staff of General  Jackson.  What is yours?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Seth Moore, an' I'm always a private, but at present doin'  sentinel duty,  but wishin' I was at home in our double log house  'tween the blankets.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Have you noticed anything, Seth?&#8221; asked Harry, not at all offended  by  the nature of his reply. 
  &#8220;I've seen some snow, an' now an' then the cold top of a mountain,  an'&#8212;&#8221; 
  &#8220;An' what, Seth?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Do you see that grove straight toward the north four or five  hundred  yards away?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, but I can make nothing of it but a black blur.  It's too far  away  to tell the trunks of the trees apart.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's too fur fur me, too, an' my eyes are good, but ten or fifteen   minutes ago, leftenant, I thought I saw a shadder at the edge of the   grove.  It 'peared to me that the shadder was like that of a horse  with a  man on it.  After a while it went back among the trees an' o'  course I  lost it thar.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You feel quite sure you saw the shadow, Seth?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, leftenant.  I'm shore I ain't mistook.  I've hunted 'coons  an'  'possums at night too much to be mistook about shadders.  I  reckon,  if I may say so, shadders is my specialty, me bein' somethin'  o' a night  owl.  As shore as I'm standin' here, leftenant, and as  shore as you're  settin' there on your hoss, a mounted man come to the  edge of that wood  an' stayed thar a while, watchin' us.  I'd have  follered him, but I  couldn't leave my beat here, an' you're the first  officer I've saw since.  It may amount to nothin, an' then again it  mayn't.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm glad you told me.  I'll go into the grove myself and see if  anybody  is there now.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Leftenant, if I was you I'd be mighty keerful.  If it's a spy  it'll be  easy enough for him under the cover of the trees to shoot you  in the open  comin' toward him.&#8221; 
  Harry knew that Jackson planned a surprise of some kind and Seth  Moore's  words about the mounted man alarmed him.  He did not doubt the  accuracy  of the young mountaineer's eyesight, or his coolness, and he  resolved  that he would not go back to headquarters until he knew more  about that  &#8220;shadow.&#8221;  But Moore's advice about caution was not to be  unheeded. 
  &#8220;If you keep in the edge of our woods here,&#8221; said Moore, &#8220;an' ride  along  a piece you'll come to a little valley.  Then you kin go up that  an' come  into the grove over thar without being seed.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Good advice.  I'll take it.&#8221; 
  Harry loosened one of the pistols in his belt and rode cautiously  through  the wood as Seth Moore had suggested.  The ground sloped  rapidly, and  soon he reached the narrow but deep little valley with a  dense growth of  trees and underbrush on either side.  The valley led  upward, and he came  into the grove just as Moore had predicted. 
  This forest was of much wider extent than he had supposed.  It  stretched  northward further than he could see, and, although it was  devoid of  undergrowth, it was very dark among the trees.  He rode his  horse behind  the trunk of a great oak, and, pausing there, examined  all the forest  within eyeshot. 
  He saw nothing but the long rows of tree trunks, white on the  northern  side with snow, and he heard nothing but the cold rustle of  wind among  boughs bare of branches.  Yet he had full confidence in the  words of Seth  Moore.  He could neither see him nor hear him, but he  was sure that  somebody besides himself was in the wood.  Once more the  soul and spirit  of his great ancestor were poured into him, and for  the moment he, too,  was the wilderness rover, endowed with nerves  preternaturally acute. 
  Hidden by the great tree trunks he listened attentively.  His  horse,  oppressed by the cold and perhaps by the weariness of the day,  was  motionless and made no sound.  He waited two or three minutes and  then he  was sure that he heard a slight noise, which he believed was  made by the  hoofs of a horse walking very slowly.  Then he saw the  shadow. 
  It was the dim figure of a man on horseback, moving very cautiously  at  some distance from Harry.  He urged his own horse forward a little,   and the shadow stopped instantly.  Then he knew that he had been seen,   and he sat motionless in the saddle for an instant or two, not knowing   what to do. 
  After all, the man on horseback might be a friend.  He might be  some  scout from a band of rangers, coming to join Jackson; and not yet  sure  that the army in the woods was his.  Recovering from his  indecision he  rode forward a little and called: 
  &#8220;Who are you?&#8221; 
  The shadow made no reply, and horse and rider were motionless.   They  seemed for an instant to be phantoms, but then Harry knew that  they were  real.  He was oppressed by a feeling of the weird and  menacing.  He would  make the sinister figure move and his hand dropped  toward his pistol belt. 
  &#8220;Stop, I can fire before you!&#8221; cried the figure sharply, and then  Harry  suddenly saw a pistol barrel gleaming across the stranger's  saddle bow. 
  Harry checked his hand, but he did not consider himself beaten by  any  means.  He merely waited, wary and ready to seize his opportunity. 
  &#8220;I don't want to shoot,&#8221; said the man in a clear voice, &#8220;and I  won't  unless you make me.  I'm no friend.  I'm an enemy, that is, an  official  enemy, and I think it strange, Harry Kenton, almost the hand  of fate,  that you and I come face to face again under such  circumstances.&#8221; 
  Harry stared, and then the light broke.  Now he remembered both the  voice  and the figure. 
  &#8220;Shepard!&#8221; he exclaimed. 
  &#8220;It's so.  We're engaged upon the same duty.  I've just been  inspecting  the army of General Jackson, calculating its numbers, its  equipment,  and what it may do.  Keep your hand away from that pistol.   I might not  hit you, but the chances are that I would.  But as I  said, I don't want  to shoot.  It wouldn't help our cause or me any to  maim or kill you.  Suppose we call it peace between us for this  evening.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I agree to call it peace because I have to do it.&#8221; 
  Shepard laughed, and his laugh was not at all sarcastic or  unpleasant. 
  &#8220;Why a rage to kill?&#8221; he said.  &#8220;You and I, Harry Kenton, will find   before this war is over that we'll get quite enough of fighting in   battles without seeking to make slaughter in between.  Besides, having   met you several times, I've a friendly feeling for you.  Now turn and   ride back to your own lines and I'll go the other way.&#8221; 
  The blood sprang into Harry's face and his heart beat hard.  There  was  something dominating and powerful in the voice.  It now had the  tone of a  man who spoke to one over whom he ruled.  Yet he could do  nothing.  He saw that Shepard was alert and watchful.  He felt  instinctively that  his foe would fire if he were forced to do so and  that he would not miss.  Then despite himself, he felt admiration for  the man's skill and power,  and a pronounced intellectual quality that  he discovered in him. 
  &#8220;Very well,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;I'll turn and go back, but I want to tell  you,  Mr. Shepard, that while you have been estimating what General  Jackson's  army can do you must make that estimate high.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I've already done so,&#8221; called Shepard&#8212;Harry was riding away as he   spoke.  The boy at the edge of the wood looked back, but the shadow  was  already gone.  He rode straight across the open and Seth Moore met  him. 
  &#8220;Did you find anything?&#8221; the young mountaineer asked. 
  &#8220;Yes, there was a mounted man in a blue uniform, a spy, who has  been  watching, but he made off.  You had good eyes, Seth, and I'm  going to  report this at once to General Jackson.&#8221; 
  Harry knew that he was the bearer of an unpleasant message.   General  Jackson was relying upon surprise, and it would not please  him to know  that his movements were watched by an active and  intelligent scout or  spy.  But the man had already shown his greatness  by always insisting  upon hearing the worst of everything. 
  He found the chief, still sitting before one of the fires and  reported to  him fully.  Jackson listened without comment, but at the  end he said to  two of the brigadiers who were sitting with him: 
  &#8220;We march again at earliest dawn.  We will not wait for the  wagons.&#8221; 
  Then he added to Harry: 
  &#8220;You've done good service.  Join the sleepers, there.&#8221; 
  He pointed to a group of young officers rolled in their blankets,  and  Harry obeyed quickly.
