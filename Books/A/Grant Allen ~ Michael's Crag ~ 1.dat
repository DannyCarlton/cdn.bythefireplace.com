"Then you don't care for the place yourself, Tyrrel?" Eustace Le Neve  said, musingly, as he gazed in front of him with a comprehensive  glance at the long gray moor and the wide expanse of black and stormy  water.    
"It's bleak, of course; bleak and cold, I grant you; all this upland  plateau about the Lizard promontory seems bleak and cold everywhere;  but to my mind it has a certain wild and weird picturesqueness of its  own for all that. It aims at gloominess. I confess in its own way I  don't dislike it."    
"For my part," Tyrrel answered, clinching his hand hard as he spoke,  and knitting his brow despondently, "I simply hate it. If I wasn't the  landlord here, to be perfectly frank with you, I'd never come near  Penmorgan. I do it for conscience' sake, to be among my own people.  That's my only reason. I disapprove of absenteeism; and now the land's  mine, why, I must put up with it, I suppose, and live upon it in spite  of myself. But I do it against the grain. The whole place, if I tell  you the truth, is simply detestable to me."    
He leaned on his stick as he spoke, and looked down gloomily at the  heather. A handsome young man, Walter Tyrrel, of the true Cornish  type--tall, dark, poetical-looking, with pensive eyes and a thick  black mustache, which gave dignity and character to his otherwise  almost too delicately feminine features. And he stood on the open moor  just a hundred yards outside his own front door at Penmorgan, on the  Lizard peninsula, looking westward down a great wedge-shaped gap in  the solid serpentine rock to a broad belt of sea beyond without a ship  or a sail on it. The view was indeed, as Eustace Le Neve admitted, a  somewhat bleak and dreary one. For miles, as far as the eye could  reach, on either side, nothing was to be seen but one vast heather-  clad upland, just varied at the dip by bare ledges of dark rock and a  single gray glimpse of tossing sea between them. A little farther on,  to be sure, winding round the cliff path, one could open up a glorious  prospect on either hand over the rocky islets of Kynance and Mullion  Cove, with Mounts Bay and Penzance and the Land's End in the distance.  That was a magnificent site--if only his ancestors had had the sense  to see it. But Penmorgan House, like most other Cornish landlords'  houses, had been carefully placed--for shelter's sake, no doubt--in a  seaward hollow where the view was most restricted; and the outlook one  got from it, over black moor and blacker rocks, was certainly by no  means of a cheerful character. Eustace Le Neve himself, most cheery  and sanguine of men, just home from his South American railway-laying,  and with the luxuriant vegetation of the Argentine still fresh in his  mind, was forced to admit, as he looked about him, that the position  of his friend's house on that rolling brown moor was far from a  smiling one.    
"You used to come here when you were a boy, though," he objected,  after a pause, with a glance at the great breakers that curled in upon  the cove; "and you must surely have found it pleasant enough then,  what with the bathing and the fishing and the shooting and the  boating, and all the delights of the sea and the country."    
Walter Tyrrel nodded his head. It was clear the subject was extremely  distasteful to him.    
"Yes--till I was twelve or thirteen," he said, slowly, as one who  grudges assent, "in my uncle's time, I liked it well enough, no doubt.  Boys don't realize the full terror of sea or cliff, you know, and are  perfectly happy swimming and climbing. I used to be amphibious in  those days, like a seal or an otter--in the water half my time; and I  scrambled over the rocks--great heavens, it makes me giddy now just to  <i>think</i> where I scrambled. But when I was about thirteen years old"--his  face grew graver still--"a change seemed to come over me, and I began  . . . well, I began to hate Penmorgan. I've hated it ever since. I  shall always hate it. I learned what it all meant, I suppose--rocks,  wrecks, and accidents. I saw how dull and gloomy it was, and I  couldn't bear coming down here. I came as seldom as I dared, till my  uncle died last year and left it to me. And then there was no help for  it. I <i>had</i> to come down. It's a landlord's business, I consider, to  live among his tenants and look after the welfare of the soil,  committed to his charge by his queen and country. He holds it in  trust, strictly speaking, for the nation. So I felt I must come and  live here. But I hate it, all the same. I hate it! I hate it!"    
He said it so energetically, and with such strange earnestness in his  voice, that Eustace Le Neve, scanning his face as he spoke, felt sure  there must be some good reason for his friend's dislike of his  ancestral home, and forebore (like a man) to question him further.  Perhaps, he thought, it was connected in Tyrrel's mind with some  painful memory, some episode in his history he would gladly forget;  though, to be sure, when one comes to think of it, at thirteen such  episodes are rare and improbable. A man doesn't, as a rule, get  crossed in love at that early age; nor does he generally form lasting  and abiding antipathies. And indeed, for the matter of that, Penmorgan  was quite gloomy enough in itself, in all conscience, to account for  his dislike--a lonely and gaunt-looking granite-built house, standing  bare and square on the edge of a black moor, under shelter of a rocky  dip, in a treeless country. It must have been a terrible change for a  bachelor about town, like Walter Tyrrel, to come down at twenty-eight  from his luxurious club and his snug chambers in St. James' to the  isolation and desolation of that wild Cornish manor-house. But the  Tyrrels, he knew, were all built like that; Le Neve had been with  three of the family at Rugby; and conscience was their stumbling-  block. When once a Tyrrel was convinced his duty lay anywhere, no  consideration on earth would keep him from doing it.    
"Let's take a stroll down by the shore," Le Neve suggested,  carelessly, after a short pause, slipping his arm through his  friend's.    
"Your cliffs, at least, must be fine; they look grand and massive; and  after three years of broiling on a South American line, this fresh  sou'wester's just the thing, to my mind, to blow the cobwebs out of  one."    
He was a breezy-looking young man, this new-comer from beyond the sea  --a son of the Vikings, Tyrrel's contemporary in age, but very unlike  him in form and features; for Eustace Le Neve was fair and big-built,  a florid young giant, with tawny beard, mustache, and whiskers, which  he cut in a becoming Vandyke point of artistic carelessness. There was  more of the artist than of the engineer, indeed, about his frank and  engaging English face--a face which made one like him as soon as one  looked at him. It was impossible to do otherwise. Exuberant vitality  was the keynote of the man's being. And he was candidly open, too. He  impressed one at first sight, by some nameless instinct, with a  certain well-founded friendly confidence. A lovable soul, if ever  there was one, equally liked at once by men and women.    
"Our cliffs are fine," Walter Tyrrel answered, grudgingly, in the tone  of one who, against his will, admits an adverse point he sees no  chance of gainsaying. "They're black, and repellant, and iron-bound,  and dangerous, but they're certainly magnificent. I don't deny it.  Come and see them, by all means. They're the only lions we have to  show a stranger in this part of Cornwall, so you'd better make the  most of them."    
And he took, as if mechanically, the winding path that led down the  gap toward the frowning cove in the wall of cliff before them.    
Eustace Le Neve was a little surprised at this unexpected course, for  he himself would naturally have made rather for the top of the  promontory, whence they were certain to obtain a much finer and more  extensive view; but he had only arrived at Penmorgan the evening  before, so he bowed at once to his companion's more mature experience  of Cornish scenery. They threaded their way through the gully, for it  was little more--a great water-worn rent in the dark serpentine rocks,  with the sea at its lower end--picking their path as they went along  huge granite boulders or across fallen stones, till they reached a  small beach of firm white sand, on whose even floor the waves were  rolling in and curling over magnificently. It was a curious place,  Eustace thought, rather dreary than beautiful. On either side rose  black cliffs, towering sheer into the air, and shutting out overhead  all but a narrow cleft of murky sky. Around, the sea dashed itself in  angry white foam against broken stacks and tiny weed-clad skerries. At  the end of the first point a solitary islet, just separated from the  mainland by a channel of seething water, jutted above into the waves,  with hanging tresses of blue and yellow seaweed. Tyrrel pointed to it  with one hand. "That's Michael's Crag," he said, laconically. "You've  seen it before, no doubt, in half a dozen pictures. It's shaped  exactly like St. Michael's Mount in miniature. A marine painter fellow  down here's forever taking its portrait."    
Le Neve gazed around him with a certain slight shudder of unspoken  disapprobation. This place didn't suit his sunny nature. It was even  blacker and more dismal than the brown moorland above it. Tyrrel  caught the dissatisfaction in his companion's eye before Le Neve had  time to frame it in words.    
"Well, you don't think much of it?" he said, inquiringly.    
"I can't say I do," Le Neve answered, with apologetic frankness. "I  suppose South America has spoilt me for this sort of thing. But it's  not to my taste. I call it gloomy, without being even impressive."    
"Gloomy," Tyrrel answered; "oh, yes, gloomy, certainly. But  impressive; well, yes. For myself, I think so. To me, it's all  terribly, unspeakably, ineffably impressive. I come here every day,  and sit close on the sands, and look out upon the sea by the edge of  the breakers. It's the only place on this awful coast one feels  perfectly safe in. You can't tumble over here, or...roll anything down  to do harm to anybody."    
A steep cliff path led up the sheer face of the rock to southward. It  was a difficult path, a mere foothold on the ledges; but its  difficulty at once attracted the engineer's attention. "Let's go up  that way!" he said, waving his hand toward it carelessly. "The view  from on top there must be infinitely finer."    
"I believe it is," Tyrrel replied, in an unconcerned voice, like one  who retails vague hearsay evidence. "I haven't seen it myself since I  was a boy of thirteen. I never go along the top of the cliffs on any  account."    
Le Neve gazed down on him, astonished. "You <i>believe</i> it is!" he  exclaimed, unable to conceal his surprise and wonder. "You never go up  there! Why, Walter, how odd of you! I was reading up the Guidebook  this morning before breakfast, and it says the walk from this point on  the Penmorgan estate to Kynance Cove is the most magnificent bit of  wild cliff scenery anywhere in Cornwall."    
"So I'm told," Tyrrel answered, unmoved. "And I remember, as a boy, I  thought it very fine. But that was long since. I never go by it."    
"Why not?" Le Neve cried.    
Tyrrel shrugged his shoulders and shook himself impatiently. "I don't  know." he answered, in a testy sort of voice. "I don't like the cliff  top... It's so dangerous, don't you know? So unsafe. So unstable. The  rocks go off so sheer, and stones topple over so easily."    
Le Neve laughed a little laugh of half-disguised contempt. He was  moving over toward the path up the cliff side as they spoke. "Why, you  used to be a first-class climber at school," he said, attempting it,  "especially when you were a little chap. I remember you could scramble  up trees like a monkey. What fun we had once in the doctor's orchard!  And as to the cliffs, you needn't go so near you have to tumble over  them. It seems ridiculous for a landowner not to know a bit of scenery  on his own estate that's celebrated and talked about all over  England."    
"I'm not afraid of tumbling over, for myself," Tyrrel answered, a  little nettled by his friend's frank tone of amusement. "I don't feel  myself so useful to my queen and country that I rate my own life at  too high a figure. It's the people below I'm chiefly concerned about.  There's always someone wandering and scrambling about these cliffs,  don't you see?--fishermen, tourists, geologists. If you let a loose  stone go, it may fall upon them and crush them."    
The engineer looked back upon him with a somewhat puzzled expression.  "Well, that's carrying conscience a point too far," he said, with one  strong hand on the rock and one sure foot in the first convenient  cranny. "If we're not to climb cliffs for fear of showering down  stones on those who stand below, we won't dare to walk or ride or  drive or put to sea for fear of running over or colliding against  somebody. We shall have to stop all our trains and keep all our  steamers in harbor. There's nothing in this world quite free from  risk. We've got to take it and lump it. You know the old joke about  those dangerous beds--so many people die in them. Won't you break your  rule just for once, and come up on top here to see the view with me?"    
Tyrrel shook his head firmly. "Not to-day," he answered, with a quiet  smile. "Not by that path, at any rate. It's too risky for my taste.  The stones are so loose. And it overhangs the road the quarrymen go to  the cave by."    
Le Neve had now made good his foothold up the first four or five  steps. "Well, you've no objection to my going, at any rate?" he said,  with a wave of one hand, in his cheerful good-humor. "You don't put a  veto on your friends here, do you?"    
"Oh, not the least objection," Tyrrel answered, hurriedly, watching  him climb, none the less, with nervous interest. "It's...it's a purely  personal and individual feeling. Besides," he added, after a pause," I  can stop below here, if need be, and warn the quarrymen."    
"I'll be back in ten minutes," Le Neve shouted from the cliff.    
"No, don't hurry," his host shouted back. "Take your own time, it's  safest. Once you get to the top you'd better walk along the whole  cliff path to Kynance. They tell me its splendid; the view's so wide;  and you can easily get back across the moor by lunch-time. Only, mind  about the edge, and whatever you do, let no stones roll over."    
"All right," Le Neve made answer, clinging close to a point of rock.  "I'll do no damage. It's opening out beautifully on every side now. I  can see round the corner to St. Michael's Mount; and the point at the  end there must be Tol-Pedn-Penwith."
