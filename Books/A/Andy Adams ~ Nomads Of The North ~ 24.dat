  Meshaba, the old Cree, sat on the sunny side of a rock on the   sunny side of a slope that looked up and down the valley. Meshaba   &#8212;who many, many years ago had been called The Giant&#8212;was very old.   He was so old that even the Factor's books over at Fort O' God had  no  record of his birth; nor the &quot;post logs&quot; at Albany House, or   Cumberland House, or Norway House, or Fort Churchill. Perhaps  farther  north, at Lac La Biche, at Old Fort Resolution, or at Fort  McPherson  some trace of him might have been found. His skin was  crinkled and  weather-worn, like dry buckskin, and over his brown,  thin face his  hair fell to his shoulders, snow-white. His hands  were thin, even his  nose was thin with the thinness of age. But  his eyes were still like  dark garnets, and down through the  greater part of a century their  vision had come undimmed. 
  They roved over the valley now. At Meshaba's back, a mile on the   other side of the ridge, was the old trapper's cabin, where he  lived  alone. The winter had been long and cold, and in his  gladness at the  coming of spring Meshaba had come up the ridge to  bask in the sun and  look out over the changing world. For an hour  his eyes had travelled  up and down the valley like the eyes of an  old and wary hawk. The dark  spruce and cedar forest edged in the  far side of the valley; between  that and the ridge rolled the  meadowy plain&#8212;still covered with  melting snow in places, and in  others bare and glowing, a dull green  in the sunlight. From where  he sat Meshaba could also see a rocky  scarp of the ridge that  projected out into the plain a hundred yards  away. But this did  not interest him, except that if it had not been in  his line of  vision he could have seen a mile farther down the valley. 
  In that hour of Sphinx-like watching, while the smoke curled   slowly up from his black pipe, Meshaba had seen life. Half a mile   from where he was sitting a band of caribou had come out of the   timber and wandered into a less distant patch of low bush. They  had  not thrilled his old blood with the desire to kill, for there  was  already a fresh carcass hung up at the back of his cabin.  Still  farther away he had seen a hornless moose, so grotesque in  its spring  ugliness that the parchment-like skin of his face had  cracked for half  an instant in a smile, and out of him had come a  low and appreciative  grunt; for Meshaba, in spite of his age,  still had a sense of humour  left. Once he had seen a wolf, and  twice a fox, and now his eyes were  on an eagle high over his head.  Meshaba would not have shot that  eagle, for year after year it had  come down through time with him, and  it was always there soaring  in the sun when spring came. So Meshaba  grunted as he watched it,  and was glad that Upisk had not died during  the winter. 
  &quot;Kata y ati sisew,&quot; he whispered to himself, a glow of   superstition in his fiery eyes. &quot;We have lived long together, and  it  is fated that we die together, Oh Upisk. The spring has come  for us  many times, and soon the black winter will swallow us up  for ever.&quot; 
  His eyes shifted slowly, and then they rested on the scarp of the   ridge that shut out his vision. His heart gave a sudden thump in  his  body. His pipe fell from his mouth to his hand; and he stared  without  moving, stared like a thing of rock. 
  On a flat sunlit shelf not more than eighty or ninety yards away   stood a young black bear. In the warm glow of the sunlight the  bear's  spring coat shone like polished jet. But it was not the  sudden  appearance of the bear that amazed Meshaba. It was the fact  that  another animal was standing shoulder to shoulder with  Wakayoo, and  that it was not a brother bear, but a huge wolf.  Slowly one of his  thin hands rose to his eyes and he wiped away  what he thought must  surely be a strange something that was  fooling his vision. In all his  eighty years and odd he had never  known a wolf to be thus friendly  with a bear. Nature had made them  enemies. Nature had fore-doomed  their hatred to be the deepest  hatred of the forests. Therefore, for a  space, Meshaba doubted his  eyes. But in another moment he saw that the  miracle had truly come  to pass. For the wolf turned broadside to him  and it WAS a wolf! A  huge, big-boned beast that stood as high at the  shoulders as  Wakayoo, the bear; a great beast, with a great head,  and&#8212; 
  It was then that Meshaba's heart gave another thump, for the tail   of a wolf is big and bushy in the springtime, and the tail of this   beast was as bare of hair as a beaver's tail! 
  &quot;Ohne moosh!&quot; gasped Meshaba, under his breath&#8212;&quot;a dog!&quot; 
  He seemed to draw slowly into himself, slinking backward. His   rifle stood just out of reach on the other side of the rock. 
  At the other end of that eighty or ninety yards Neewa and Miki   stood blinking in the bright sunlight, with the mouth of the  cavern  in which Neewa had slept so many months just behind them.  Miki was  puzzled. Again it seemed to him that it was only  yesterday, and not  months ago, that he had left Neewa in that den,  sleeping his lazy head  off. And now that he had returned to him  after his own hard winter in  the forests he was astonished to find  Neewa so big. For Neewa had  grown steadily through his four  months' nap and he was half again as  big as when he went to sleep.  Could Miki have spoken Cree, and had  Meshaba given him the  opportunity, he might have explained the  situation. 
  &quot;You see, Mr. Indian&quot;&#8212;he might have said&#8212;&quot;this dub of a bear and   I have been pals from just about the time we were born. A man  named  Challoner tied us together first when Neewa, there, was just  about as  big as your head, and we did a lot of scrapping before we  got properly  acquainted. Then we got lost, and after that we  hitched up like  brothers; and we had a lot of fun and excitement  all through last  summer, until at last, when the cold weather  came, Neewa hunted up  this hole in the ground and the lazy cuss  went to sleep for all  winter. I won't mention what happened to me  during the winter. It was  a-plenty. So this spring I had a hunch  it was about time for Neewa to  get the cobwebs out of his fool  head, and came back. And&#8212;here we are!  But tell me this: WHAT  MAKES NEEWA SO BIG?&quot; 
  It was at least that thought&#8212;the bigness of Neewa&#8212;that was   filling Miki's head at the present moment. And Meshaba, in place  of  listening to an explanation, was reaching for his rifle&#8212;while  Neewa,  with his brown muzzle sniffing the wind, was gathering in a  strange  smell. Of the three, Neewa saw nothing to be wondered at  in the  situation itself. When he had gone to sleep four and a half  months ago  Miki was at his side; and to-day, when he awoke, Miki  was still at his  side. The four and a half months meant nothing to  him. Many times he  and Miki had gone to sleep, and had awakened  together. For all the  knowledge he had of time it might have been  only last night that he  had fallen asleep. 
  The one thing that made Neewa uneasy now was that strange odour he   had caught in the air. Instinctively he seized upon it as a   menace&#8212;at least as something that he would rather NOT smell than   smell. So he turned away with a warning WOOF to Miki. When Meshaba   peered around the edge of the rock, expecting an easy shot, he  caught  only a flash of the two as they were disappearing. He fired  quickly. 
  To Miki and Neewa the report of the rifle and the moaning whirr of   the bullet over their backs recalled memories of a host of things,   and Neewa settled down to that hump-backed, flat-eared flight of  his  that kept Miki pegging along at a brisk pace for at least a  mile. Then  Neewa stopped, puffing audibly. Inasmuch as he had had  nothing to eat  for a third of a year, and was weak from long  inactivity, the run came  within an ace of putting him out of  business. It was several minutes  before he could gather his wind  sufficiently to grunt. Miki,  meanwhile, was carefully smelling of  him from his rump to his muzzle.  There was apparently nothing  missing, for he gave a delighted little  yap at the end, and, in  spite of his size and the dignity of increased  age, he began  frisking about Neewa In a manner emphatically expressive  of his  joy at his comrade's awakening. 
  &quot;It's been a deuce of a lonely winter, Neewa, and I'm tickled to   death to see you on your feet again,&quot; his antics said. &quot;What'll we   do? Go for a hunt?&quot; 
  This seemed to be the thought in Neewa's mind, for he headed   straight up the valley until they came to an open fen where he   proceeded to quest about for a dinner of roots and grass; and as  he  searched he grunted&#8212;grunted in his old, companionable, cubbish  way.  And Miki, hunting with him, found that once more the  loneliness had  gone out of his world.
