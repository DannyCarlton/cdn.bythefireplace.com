    The lower part of the cabin was divided into two rooms, over which   was a loft. There was no staircase; but there was a short ladder by   which the ascent was made. 
  &quot;You're to sleep up there,&quot; said Jack, pointing to the loft. &quot;Me  and  the old woman sleep below.&quot; 
  &quot;All right,&quot; said Bradley, gaping. &quot;I can sleep anywhere to-night.   I'm powerful sleepy.&quot; 
  He ascended the ladder first, and Ben followed. There was no   bedstead, but a straw pallet was stretched in one corner, with a   blanket in place of a quilt. 
  &quot;I sha'n't undress, Ben,&quot; said Bradley, throwing himself down on  the  rude bed. &quot;I can't keep my eyes open long enough. I think I never   felt so sleepy in the whole course of my life.&quot; 
  &quot;I am tired, but not sleepy,&quot; returned Ben. 
  &quot;I won't undress, either. I can sleep just as well in my clothes.&quot; 
  Scarcely a minute had passed when Bradley was breathing in the   unconsciousness of slumber. 
  As Ben lay down beside him, he could not help feeling surprised at   his companion's yielding so suddenly to the power of sleep. That he   should be tired was not surprising; but when seated outside he had   not seemed unusually drowsy, that is, up to the time of his drinking   the wine. A quick suspicion flashed upon Ben's mind. Had the wine   anything to do with this sudden drowsiness? 
  Ben had not much experience of life; but he had heard of liquors   being drugged, and it seemed possible that the wine which had been   offered to Bradley might have been tampered with. If so, it was only   too evident what was the object of their host. It was natural to   suppose that the two travelers were provided with money, and it was   undoubtedly the intention of Jack Carter to rob them in their sleep. 
  This was not a pleasant thought, nor one calculated to soothe Ben  to  sleep. He was only a boy, and to find himself in a robber's den was   certainly rather a startling discovery. If he had been able to   consult with his companion, it would have been a relief; but Bradley   was in a profound sleep. 
  Ben nudged him, but without the slightest effect. He was insensible   as a log. Finding more vigorous measures necessary, the boy shook   him, but succeeded only in eliciting a few muttered words. 
  &quot;I can't wake him,&quot; thought Ben, more and more disturbed in mind.  &quot;I  am sure it must be the wine which makes him sleep so heavily. What   can I do?&quot; 
  This question was more easily asked than answered. Ben was quite   aware that single-handed he could not cope with a powerful man like   Carter. With Bradley's help he would have felt secure; but no   assistance could now be expected from his companion. So far as he   could see, he must submit to be robbed, and to see his companion   robbed. Of course, there was a chance that he might be mistaken. It   was possible that Bradley's might be a natural sleep, induced by   excessive fatigue, and there might be nothing sinister in the   intentions of their host. 
  Ben, however, found it difficult to convince himself of this, much   as he desired to do so. The existence of a gang of robbers in the   vicinity, referred to by Bradley, was not calculated to reassure  him.  If Carter did not belong to this gang, his personal appearance  was  certainly calculated to foster the suspicion of his connection  with  them, and the suspicion was strengthened by the fact of his  living in  this lonely place without any apparent inducement. 
  For the first time, perhaps, since he had left the East, he wished   himself in the security of home. As Deacon Pitkin's hired boy,  living  on frugal diet, he would have been better off than here at  the mercy  of a mountain bandit. 
  But Ben was a boy of spirit, and not inclined to submit in a   cowardly manner without first considering if in any possible manner   he could guard against the danger which menaced him. Fatigued as he   was by the day's ride, he would, under ordinary circumstances, have   fallen asleep quickly; but now anxiety and apprehension kept him   broad awake. 
  &quot;If I could only rouse Bradley,&quot; he said to himself, &quot;I should feel   more comfortable. I don't like the responsibility of deciding what  is  best to be done.&quot; 
  His thoughts were interrupted by the sound of low voices below.   Evidently Carter and his wife were conversing, and probably about   them. Anxious to hear what was said, as this might give him a clue  to  their plans, Ben rose softly from his low couch, and drew near  the  edge of the opening through which he had mounted into the loft.  In  this position he was able to hear what was said. 
  &quot;They must have money,&quot; said Carter. &quot;They would need it to get  them  out to the mines. Whatever it is, I am bound to have it.&quot; 
  &quot;The man seems strong,&quot; replied the wife. &quot;You may not find it an   easy task to master him.&quot; 
  &quot;What can he do?&quot; returned Carter contemptuously. &quot;He is in a dead   sleep. I put enough stuff into his wine to keep him in a stupor for   twelve good hours. If I'm not a match for a sleeping man, I'll go  and  hang myself.&quot; 
  &quot;But the boy-he took no wine.&quot; 
  &quot;No; he's one of them temperance sneaks. But he's only a baby. I   could lay him out with one hand.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't harm him, Jack!&quot; said the woman. &quot;I can't help feeling  kindly  to him. Our boy, had he lived, would have been about his age. I   can't help thinking of that.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't be silly! Because we had a boy once, mustn't interfere with   business.&quot; 
  &quot;But you won't hurt him, Jack?&quot; pleaded the woman, who, hard as she   seemed, appeared to have a soft side to her nature. 
  &quot;No; I won't hurt the brat if he behaves himself and doesn't get   bumptious. Likely enough he'll be fast asleep. Boys at his age   generally sleep well.&quot; 
  &quot;In the morning they will discover that they have been robbed. What   will you say to them?&quot; 
  &quot;Tell them it's none of my business; that I know nothing about it.&quot; 
  &quot;But if the boy is awake, and sees you at work, Jack?&quot; 
  &quot;Then it will be different. It would have been better for him to   have taken the wine.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you think he suspected anything?&quot; 
  &quot;No; how could he suspect that the wine was drugged? He is one of   them temperance sneaks, I tell you.&quot; 
  &quot;How soon are you going up, Jack?&quot; 
  &quot;In half an hour. I want to give the boy time enough to get asleep.   That will make matters easy.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't you think I had better go up, Jack?&quot; 
  &quot;Why should you? Why should I let a woman do my work?&quot; 
  &quot;Then I should know the boy would receive no harm.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, that's it, is it? You make a great fuss about the boy.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; I can't help thinking about my own boy.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, drop that! It makes me sick. Wasn't he my boy as well as  yours?  I'm sorry he's gone. I could have brought him up to be a help  to us  in our business.&quot; 
  &quot;Never, Jack, never!&quot; exclaimed his wife fervently. 
  &quot;Hello! what's that?&quot; 
  &quot;I mean that I should have been unwilling to have our son grow up  no  better than we are. He, at any rate, should have been a good man.&quot; 
  &quot;What's up now, old woman? You haven't been attending Sunday-school   lately, have you?&quot; demanded Jack, with a sneer. 
  &quot;I did once, Jack, and I haven't quite forgotten what I learned   there, though it don't look like it now.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you going back on me?&quot; demanded Jack fiercely. 
  &quot;No, Jack, it's too late for that. I have helped you, and I mean to   help you, but to-night the sight of that boy, and the thought of our   son, who died so long ago, have given me a turn. If it was a man, it   would be different. But you have promised you won't harm him, and no   more need be said.&quot; 
  &quot;Too much has been said already, to my thinkin',&quot; growled Jack.   &quot;However, that's over, and I expect you to help me if I need help.&quot; 
  Ben heard every word that was said, and it confirmed his  suspicions.  There was no doubt that an attempt would be made to rob  him and his  companion before morning, and the prospect was not  pleasant. By  submitting quietly he would come to no harm, and the loss  of the  money would not be irreparable. He and Bradley had each started  with  a hundred dollars, supplied by Miss Doughlas, and thus far but   little of this sum had been spent. Their employer would doubtless   send them a further supply if they were robbed, but they would be   reluctant to apply to her, since the loss would be partly the result   of their imprudence. 
  Ben felt that he was in a tight place, and he was not quite certain   what he should or could do.
