All happy times must end, and the happier the sooner. At one short  week's close they hurried on to Perugia.    
And how full Alan had been of Perugia beforehand! He loved every  stone of the town, every shadow of the hillsides, he told Herminia  at Florence; and Herminia started on her way accordingly well  prepared to fall quite as madly in love with the Umbrian capital as  Alan himself had done.    
The railway journey, indeed, seemed extremely pretty. What a march  of sweet pictures! They mounted with creaking wheels the slow  ascent up the picturesque glen where the Arno runs deep, to the  white towers of Arezzo; then Cortona throned in state on its lonely  hill-top, and girt by its gigantic Etruscan walls; next the low  bank, the lucid green water, the olive-clad slopes of reedy  Thrasymene; last of all, the sere hills and city-capped heights of  their goal, Perugia.    
For its name's sake alone, Herminia was prepared to admire the  antique Umbrian capital. And Alan loved it so much, and was so  determined she ought to love it too, that she was ready to be  pleased with everything in it. Until she arrived there--and then,  oh, poor heart, what a grievous disappointment! It was late April  weather when they reached the station at the foot of that high hill  where Augusta Perusia sits lording it on her throne over the wedded  valleys of the Tiber and the Clitumnus. Tramontana was blowing.  No rain had fallen for weeks; the slopes of the lower Apennines,  ever dry and dusty, shone still drier and dustier than Alan had yet  beheld them. Herminia glanced up at the long white road, thick in  deep gray powder, that led by endless zigzags along the dreary  slope to the long white town on the shadeless hill-top. At first  sight alone, Perugia was a startling disillusion to Herminia. She  didn't yet know how bitterly she was doomed hereafter to hate every  dreary dirty street in it. But she knew at the first blush that  the Perugia she had imagined and pictured to herself didn't really  exist and had never existed.    
She had figured in her own mind a beautiful breezy town, high set  on a peaked hill, in fresh and mossy country. She had envisaged  the mountains to her soul as clad with shady woods, and strewn with  huge boulders under whose umbrageous shelter bloomed waving masses  of the pretty pale blue Apennine anemones she saw sold in big  bunches at the street corners in Florence. She had imagined, in  short, that Umbria was a wilder Italian Wales, as fresh, as green,  as sweet-scented, as fountain-fed. And she knew pretty well whence  she had derived that strange and utterly false conception. She had  fancied Perugia as one of those mountain villages described by  Macaulay, the sort of hilltop stronghold    
<blockquote><i><small> <br>"That, hid by beech and pine, <br>Like an eagle's nest hangs on the crest <br>Of purple Apennine."</small></i></blockquote><br>
Instead of that, what manner of land did she see actually before  her? Dry and shadeless hill-sides, tilled with obtrusive tilth to  their topmost summit; ploughed fields and hoary olive-groves  silvering to the wind, in interminable terraces; long suburbs,  unlovely in their gaunt, bare squalor, stretching like huge arms of  some colossal cuttlefish over the spurs and shoulders of that  desecrated mountain. No woods, no moss, no coolness, no greenery;  all nature toned down to one monotonous grayness. And this dreary  desert was indeed the place where her baby must be born, the baby  predestined to regenerate humanity!    
Oh, why did they ever leave that enchanted Florence!    
Meanwhile Alan had got together the luggage, and engaged a  ramshackle Perugian cab; for the public vehicles of Perugia are  perhaps, as a class, the most precarious and incoherent known to  science. However, the luggage was bundled on to the top by Our  Lady's grace, without dissolution of continuity; the lean-limbed  horses were induced by explosive volleys of sound Tuscan oaths to  make a feeble and spasmodic effort; and bit by bit the sad little  cavalcade began slowly to ascend the interminable hill that rises  by long loops to the platform of the Prefettura.    
That drive was the gloomiest Herminia had ever yet taken. Was it  the natural fastidiousness of her condition, she wondered, or was  it really the dirt and foul smells of the place that made her  sicken at first sight of the wind-swept purlieus? Perhaps a little  of both; for in dusty weather Perugia is the most endless town to  get out of in Italy; and its capacity for the production of  unpleasant odors is unequalled no doubt from the Alps to Calabria.  As they reached the bare white platform at the entry to the upper  town, where Pope Paul's grim fortress once frowned to overawe the  audacious souls of the liberty-loving Umbrians, she turned mute  eyes to Alan for sympathy. And then for the first time the  terrible truth broke over her that Alan wasn't in the least  disappointed or disgusted; he knew it all before; he was accustomed  to it and liked it! As for Alan, he misinterpreted her glance,  indeed, and answered with that sort of proprietary pride we all of  us assume towards a place we love, and are showing off to a  newcomer: "Yes, I thought you'd like this view, dearest; isn't it  wonderful, wonderful? That's Assisi over yonder, that strange  white town that clings by its eyelashes to the sloping hill-side:  and those are the snowclad heights of the Gran Sasso beyond; and  that's Montefalco to the extreme right, where the sunset gleam just  catches the hill-top."    
His words struck dumb horror into Herminia's soul. Poor child, how  she shrank at it! It was clear, then, instead of being shocked and  disgusted, Alan positively admired this human Sahara. With an  effort she gulped down her tears and her sighs, and pretended to  look with interest in the directions he pointed. <i>She</i> could see  nothing in it all but dry hill-sides, crowned with still drier  towns; unimagined stretches of sultry suburb; devouring wastes of  rubbish and foul immemorial kitchen-middens. And the very fact  that for Alan's sake she couldn't bear to say so--seeing how  pleased and proud he was of Perugia, as if it had been built from  his own design--made the bitterness of her disappointment more  difficult to endure. She would have given anything at that moment  for an ounce of human sympathy.    
She had to learn in time to do without it.    
They spent that night at the comfortable hotel, perhaps the best in  Italy. Next morning, they were to go hunting for apartments in the  town, where Alan knew of a suite that would exactly suit them.  After dinner, in the twilight, filled with his artistic joy at  being back in Perugia, his beloved Perugia, he took Herminia out  for a stroll, with a light wrap round her head, on the terrace of  the Prefettura. The air blew fresh and cool now with a certain  mountain sharpness; for, as Alan assured her with pride, they stood  seventeen hundred feet above the level of the Mediterranean. The  moon had risen; the sunset glow had not yet died off the slopes of  the Assisi hill-sides. It streamed through the perforated belfry  of San Domenico; it steeped in rose-color the slender and turreted  shaft of San Pietro, "Perugia's Pennon," the Arrowhead of Umbria.  It gilded the gaunt houses that jut out upon the spine of the Borgo  hill into the valley of the Tiber. Beyond, rose shadowy Apennines,  on whose aerial flanks towns and villages shone out clear in the  mellow moonlight. Far away on their peaks faint specks of  twinkling fire marked indistinguishable sites of high hill-top  castles.    
Alan turned to her proudly. "Well, what do you think of that?" he  asked with truly personal interest.    
Herminia could only gasp out in a half reluctant way, "It's a  beautiful view, Alan. Beautiful; beautiful; beautiful!"    
But she felt conscious to herself it owed its beauty in the main  to the fact that the twilight obscured so much of it. To-morrow  morning, the bare hills would stand out once more in all their  pristine bareness; the white roads would shine forth as white and  dusty as ever; the obtrusive rubbish heaps would press themselves  at every turn upon eye and nostril. She hated the place, to say  the truth; it was a terror to her to think she had to stop so long  in it.    
Most famous towns, in fact, need to be twice seen: the first time  briefly to face the inevitable disappointment to our expectations;  the second time, at leisure, to reconstruct and appraise the  surviving reality. Imagination so easily beggars performance.  Rome, Cairo, the Nile, are obvious examples; the grand exceptions  are Venice and Florence,--in a lesser degree, Bruges, Munich, Pisa.  As for Umbria, 'tis a poor thing; our own Devon snaps her fingers  at it.    
Moreover, to say the truth, Herminia was too fresh to Italy to  appreciate the smaller or second-rate towns at their real value.  Even northerners love Florence and Venice at first sight; those  take their hearts by storm; but Perugia, Siena, Orvieto, are an  acquired taste, like olives and caviare, and it takes time to  acquire it. Alan had not made due allowance for this psychological  truth of the northern natures. A Celt in essence, thoroughly  Italianate himself, and with a deep love for the picturesque, which  often makes men insensible to dirt and discomfort, he expected to  Italianize Herminia too rapidly. Herminia, on the other hand,  belonged more strictly to the intellectual and somewhat inartistic  English type. The picturesque alone did not suffice for her.  Cleanliness and fresh air were far dearer to her soul than the  quaintest street corners, the oddest old archways; she pined in  Perugia for a green English hillside.    
The time, too, was unfortunate, after no rain for weeks; for  rainlessness, besides doubling the native stock of dust, brings out  to the full the ancestral Etruscan odors of Perugia. So, when next  morning Herminia found herself installed in a dingy flat, in a  morose palazzo, in the main street of the city, she was glad that  Alan insisted on going out alone to make needful purchases of  groceries and provisions, because it gave her a chance of flinging  herself on her bed in a perfect agony of distress and disappointment,  and having a good cry, all alone, at the aspect of the home where  she was to pass so many eventful weeks of her existence.    
Dusty, gusty Perugia! O baby, to be born for the freeing of woman,  was it here, was it here you must draw your first breath, in an air  polluted by the vices of centuries!
