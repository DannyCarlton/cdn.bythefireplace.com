  For a brief space after the breaking of the scow-sweep Kent did   not move. He felt Marette's arms closing tighter and tighter  around  his neck. He caught a flash of her upturned face, the flush  of a few  moments before replaced by a deathly pallor, and he knew  that without  explanation on his part she understood the almost  hopeless situation  they were in. He was glad of that. It gave him  a sense of relief to  know that she would not go into a panic, no  matter what happened. He  bowed his face to hers, so that he felt  the velvety smoothness of her  cheek. She turned her mouth to him,  and they kissed. His embrace was  crushing for a moment, fierce  with his love for her, desperate with  his determination to keep  her from harm. 
  His brain was working swiftly. There was possibly one chance in   ten that the scow&#8212;rudderless and without human guidance&#8212;would  sweep  safely between the black walls and jagged teeth of the  Chute. Even if  the scow made this passage, they would be in the  power of the Police,  unless some splendid whimsicality of Fate  sent it ashore before the  launch came through. 
  On the other hand, if it was carried far enough through the lower   rapids, they might swim. And&#8212;there was the rifle laying across  the  pack. That, after all, was his greatest hope&#8212;if the scow made  the  passage of the Chute. The bulwarks of the scow would give them  greater  protection than the thinner walls of the launch would give  to their  pursuers. In his heart there raged suddenly a hatred for  that Law of  which he had been a part. It was running them to  destruction, and he  would fight. There would not be more than  three men in the launch, and  he would kill them, if killing became  a necessity. 
  They were speeding like an unbridled race-horse through the   boiling rapids now. The clumsy craft under their feet twisted and   turned. The dripping tops of great rocks shot past a little out of   their channel. And Marette, with one arm still about his neck, was   facing the peril ahead with him. They could see the Dragon's  Tooth,  black and grim, waiting squarely in their path. In another  hundred and  twenty seconds they would be upon it&#8212;or past it.  There was no time  for Kent to explain. He sprang to his pack,  whipped a knife from his  pocket, and cut the stout babiche rope  that reenforced its straps. In  another instant he was back at  Marette's side, fastening the babiche  about her waist. The other  end he gave to her, and she tied it about  his wrist. She smiled as  she finished the knot. It was a strange,  tense little smile, but  it told him that she was not afraid, that she  had great faith in  him, and knew what the babiche meant. 
  &quot;I can swim, Jeems,&quot; she cried. &quot;If we strike the rock.&quot; 
  She did not finish because of the sudden cry that came to his   lips. He had almost forgotten the most vital of all things. There  was  not time to unlace his boots. With his knife he cut the laces  in a  single downward thrust. Swiftly he freed his own feet, and  Marette's.  Even in this hour of their peril it thrilled him to see  how quickly  Marette responded to the thoughts that moved him. She  tore at her  outer garments and slipped them off as he wriggled out  of his heavy  shirt. A slim, white-underskirted little thing, her  glorious hair  flying in the wind that came through the Chute, her  throat and arms  bare, her eyes shining at Kent, she came again  close within his arms,  and her lips framed softly his name. And a  moment later she turned her  face up, and cried quickly, 
  &quot;Kiss me, Jeems&#8212;kiss me&#8212;&quot; 
  Her warm lips clung to his, and her bare arms encircled his neck   with the choking grip of a child's. He looked ahead and braced   himself on his feet, and after that he buried one of his hands in  the  soft mass of her hair and pressed her face against his naked  breast. 
  Ten seconds later the crash came. Squarely amidships the scow   struck the Dragon's Tooth. Kent was prepared for the shock, but  his  attempt to hold his feet, with Marette in his arms, was  futile. The  bulwark saved them from crashing against the slippery  face of the rock  itself. Amid the roar of water that filled his  ears he was conscious  of the rending of timbers. The scow bulged  up with the mighty force  beneath, and for a second or two it  seemed as though that force was  going to overturn and submerge it.  Then slowly it began to slip off  the nose of the rock. 
  Holding to the rail with one hand and clinging to Marette with his   other arm, Kent was gripped in the horror of what was happening.  The  scow was slipping INTO THE RIGHT HAND CHANNEL! In that channel  there  was no hope&#8212;only death. 
  Marette was squarely facing the thing ahead. In this hour when   each second held a lifetime of suspense Kent saw that she  understood.  Yet she did not cry out. Her face was dead white. Her  hair and arms  and shoulders were dripping with the splash of  water. But she was not  terrified as he had seen terror. When she  turned her eyes to him, he  was amazed by the quiet, calm look that  was in them. Her lips  trembled. 
  His soul expressed itself in a wordless cry that was drowned in   another crash of timber as a jutting snag of the Tooth crumpled up   the little cabin as if it had been pasteboard. He felt  overwhelming  him the surge of a thing mightier than the menace of  the Chute. He  could not lose! It was inconceivable. Impossible!  With HER to fight  for&#8212;this slim, wonderful creature who smiled at  him even as she saw  death. 
  And then, as his arm closed still more tightly about her, the   monsters of power and death gave him their answer. The scow swung   free of the Dragon's Tooth, half-filled with water. Its cracked  and  broken carcass was caught in the rock jaws of the eastern  channel. It  ceased to be a floating thing. It was inundation,  dissolution, utter  obliteration almost without shock. And Kent  found himself in the  thundering rush of waters, holding to  Marette. 
  For a space they were under. Black water and white froth fumed and   exploded over them. It seemed an age before fresh air filled  Kent's  nostrils. He thrust Marette upward and cried out to her. He  heard her  answer. 
  &quot;I'm all right&#8212;Jeems!&quot; 
  His swimming prowess was of little avail now. He was like a chip.   All his effort was to make of himself a barrier between Marette's   soft body and the rocks. It was not the water itself that he  feared,  but the rocks. 
  There were scores and hundreds of them, like the teeth of a mighty   grinding machine. And the jaw was a quarter of a mile in length.  He  felt the first shock, the second, the third. He was not  thinking of  time or distance, but was fighting solely to keep  himself between  Marette and death. The first time he failed, a  blind sort of rage  burned in his brain. 
  He saw her white body strained over a slippery, deluge-worn rock.   Her head was flung back, and he saw the long masses of her hair   streaming out in the white froth, and he thought for an instant  that  her fragile body had been broken. He fought still more  fiercely after  that. And she knew for what he was fighting. Only  in an unreal sort of  way was he conscious of shock and hurt. It  gave him no physical pain.  Yet he sensed the growing dizziness in  his head, an increasing lack of  strength in his arms and body. 
  They were halfway through the Chute when he shot against a rock   with terrific force. The contact tore Marette from him. He plunged   for her, missed his grip, and then saw her opposite him, clinging  to  the same rock. The babiche rope had saved her. Fastened about  her  waist and tied to his wrist, it still held them together&#8212;with  the  five feet of rock between them. 
  Panting, their life half beaten out of them, their eyes met over   that rock. Now that he was out of the water, the blood began   streaming from Kent's arms and shoulders and face, but he smiled  at  her as a few moments before she had smiled at him. Her eyes  were  filled with the pain of his hurts. He nodded back in the  direction  from which they had come. 
  &quot;We're out of the worst of it,&quot; he tried to shout. &quot;As soon as   we've got our wind, I will climb over the rock to you. It won't  take  us longer than a couple of minutes, perhaps less, to make the  quiet  water at the end of the channel.&quot; 
  She heard him and nodded her reply. He wanted to give her   confidence. And he had no intention of resting, for her position   filled him with a terror which he fought to hide. The babiche  rope,  not half as large around as his little finger, had swung her  to the  downstream side of the rock. It was the slender thread of  buckskin and  his own weight that were holding her. If the buckskin  should break&#8212; 
  He thanked God that it was the tough babiche that had been around   his pack. An inch at a time he began to draw himself up on the  rock.  The undertow behind the rock had flung a mass of Marette's  long hair  toward him, so that it was a foot or two nearer to him  than her  clinging hands. He worked himself toward that, for he saw  that he  could reach it more quickly than he could reach her. At  the same time  he had to keep his end of the babiche taut. It was,  from the  beginning, an almost superhuman task. The rock was  slippery as oil.  Twice his eyes shot down-stream, with the thought  that it might be  better to cast himself bodily into the water, and  after that draw  Marette to him by means of the babiche. What he  saw convinced him that  such action would be fatal. He must have  Marette in his arms. If he  lost her&#8212;even for a few seconds&#8212;the  life would be beaten from her  body in that rock-strewn maelstrom  below. 
  And then, suddenly, the babiche cord about his wrist grew loose.   The reaction almost threw him back. With the loosening of it a cry   came from Marette. It all happened in an instant, in almost less  time  than his brain could seize upon the significance of it&#8212;the  slipping  of her hands from the rock, the shooting of her white  body away from  him in the still whiter spume of the rapids, The  rock had cut the  babiche, and she was gone! With a cry that was  like the cry of a  madman he plunged after her. The water engulfed  him. He twisted  himself up, freeing himself from the undertow.  Twenty feet ahead of  him&#8212;thirty&#8212;he caught a glimpse of a white  arm and then of Marette's  face, before she disappeared in a wall  of froth. 
  Into that froth he shot after her. He came out of it blinded,   groping wildly for her, crying out her name. His fingers caught  the  end of the babiche that was fastened about his own wrist, and  he  clutched it savagely, believing for a moment that he had found  her.  Thicker and more deadly the rocks of the lower passage rose  in his  way. They seemed like living things, like devils filled  with the  desire to torture and destroy. They struck and beat at  him. Their  laughter was the roar of a Niagara. He no longer cried  out. His brain  grew heavy, and clubs were beating him&#8212;beating and  breaking him into  a formless thing. The rock-drifts of spume,  lather-white, like the  frosting of a monster cake, turned gray and  then black. 
  He did not know when he ceased fighting. The day went out. Night   came. The world was oblivion. And for a space he ceased to live.
