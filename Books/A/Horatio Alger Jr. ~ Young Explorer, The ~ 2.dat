    Ben's father had died three months before. He had lost his mother   when ten years old, and having neither brother nor sister was left   quite alone in the world. At one time his father had possessed a few   thousand dollars, but by unlucky investments he had lost nearly all,   so that Ben's inheritance amounted to less than four hundred  dollars. 
  This thought troubled Mr. Stanton, and on his death-bed he spoke   about it to his son. 
  &quot;I shall leave you almost destitute, Ben,&quot; he said. &quot;If I had acted   more wisely it would have been different.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't trouble yourself about that, father,&quot; said Ben promptly. &quot;I   am young and strong, and I shall be sure to get along.&quot; 
  &quot;You will have to work hard, and the world is a hard taskmaster.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't feel afraid, father. I am sure I shall succeed.&quot; 
  The dying father was cheered by Ben's confident words. Our hero was   strong and sturdy, his limbs active, and his face ruddy with health.   He looked like a boy who could get along. He was not a sensitive   plant, and not to be discouraged by rebuffs. The father's brow   cleared. 
  &quot;I am glad you are not afraid to meet what is in store for you,&quot; he   said. &quot;I believe you will do your part, and God helps those who help   themselves.&quot; 
  After his father's death, Ben became an inmate of his uncle's  family  while the estate was being settled. He paid for his board  partly by  work in the shop, and partly by doing chores. This brings us  to the  day when the conversation detailed in the first chapter took  place. 
  On the following morning Ben was sent on an errand to the village   store. On his way he overtook Deacon Pitkin. 
  &quot;Good mornin', Ben!&quot; said the deacon. &quot;Where are you goin'?&quot; 
  &quot;To the store, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;So am I. Ef you ain't in a hurry, le'ss walk along together.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, sir,&quot; answered Ben. &quot;I think I know what's comin,&quot; he   said to himself. 
  &quot;You're stayin' at your Uncle Job's, ain't you?&quot; asked Deacon   Pitkin. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't calc'late to keep on there, do you?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir; he would like to have me stay and work in the shop, but I   don't fancy shoemaking.&quot; 
  &quot;Jest so. I wouldn't ef I was you. It's an onsartin business.   There's nothin' like farmin' for stiddy work.&quot; 
  &quot;The old man kept me at work pretty stiddy,&quot; thought Ben. &quot;He'd   always find something for me to do.&quot; 
  &quot;'Ive been thinkin' that I need a boy about your age to help me on   my farm. I ain't so young as I was, and I've got a crick in my back.   I don't want a man-&quot; 
  &quot;You'd have to pay him too high wages,&quot; Ben said to himself. 
  &quot;A strong, capable boy like you could give me all the help I need.&quot; 
  &quot;I expect I could,&quot; said Ben demurely. 
  &quot;I was sayin' to Mrs. Pitkin this mornin' that I thought it would  be  a good plan to take you till you was twenty-one.&quot; 
  &quot;What did she say?&quot; asked Ben, interested. 
  &quot;Waal, she didn't say much,&quot; answered the deacon slowly; &quot;but I   guess she hasn't no objections.&quot; 
  &quot;Didn't she say that I had an awful appetite?&quot; asked Ben, smiling. 
  &quot;She said you was pretty hearty,&quot; answered the deacon, rather   surprised at Ben's penetration. &quot;Boys should curb their appetites.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think I could curb mine,&quot; said Ben thoughtfully. 
  &quot;I guess there wouldn't be any trouble about that,&quot; returned the   deacon, whose meanness ran in a different channel from his wife's,   and who took less note of what was eaten at his table. &quot;Ef you think   you'd like to engage, and we could make a bargain, you might begin   next week.&quot; 
  &quot;Jest so,&quot; said Ben. 
  The deacon looked at him rather sharply, but Ben didn't appear to   intend any disrespect in repeating his favorite phrase. 
  &quot;Did your father leave you much?&quot; inquired Deacon Pitkin. 
  &quot;A few hundred dollars,&quot; said Ben carelessly. 
  &quot;Indeed!&quot; said the deacon, gratified. &quot;What are you goin' to do  with  it?&quot; 
  &quot;Uncle Job thinks it would be best to put it in the bank.&quot; 
  &quot;Jest so. It would fetch you some interest every year-enough to   clothe you, likely. I'll tell you what I'll do, Ben. I'll give you   your board the first year, and your interest will buy your clothes.   The second year I'll give you twenty dollars and board, and maybe   twenty more the third year.&quot; 
  Ben shook his head. 
  &quot;I guess we can't make a bargain, Deacon Pitkin,&quot; he said. 
  Deacon Pitkin knew that he had made a very mean offer, and felt  that  he could afford to increase it somewhat; but he was a close hand  at  a bargain, and meant to get Ben as cheap as he could. 
  &quot;What was you expectin'?&quot; he asked cautiously. &quot;You must remember   that you're only a boy, and can't expect men's wages.&quot; 
  Ben had no idea, as we know, of engaging to work for Deacon Pitkin   at all; but he decided that the easiest way to avoid it was to put   such a value on his services as to frighten the old man. 
  &quot;I am almost as strong as a man,&quot; he said, &quot;and I can earn a great   deal more than my board the first year.&quot; 
  &quot;I might be willin' to give you twenty dollars the first year,&quot;  said  the deacon. 
  &quot;I've been thinking,&quot; said Ben soberly, &quot;that I ought to have a   hundred and fifty dollars and board the first year.&quot; 
  Deacon Pitkin fairly gasped for breath. He was fairly overpowered  by  Ben's audacity. 
  &quot;A-hundred-and-fifty-dollars!&quot; he ejaculated, turning his wrinkled   face toward our hero. 
  &quot;That's about the figure,&quot; said Ben cheerfully. &quot;A hundred and  fifty  dollars and board, or three hundred dollars, and I'll board with  my  uncle.&quot; 
  &quot;Is the boy crazy?&quot; asked the deacon, in a bewildered tone. 
  &quot;You'd have to pay a man as much as twenty dollars a month,&quot;  pursued  Ben. &quot;That's about a hundred dollars a year more.&quot; 
  &quot;Benjamin,&quot; said the deacon solemnly, &quot;do you want to ruin me?&quot; 
  &quot;No, sir, I hope not,&quot; answered our hero innocently. 
  &quot;Then why do you ask such an unheard-of price?&quot; 
  &quot;I think I'm worth it,&quot; said Ben. 
  &quot;Boys haven't much jedgment,&quot; said the deacon. &quot;You'd better let me   talk over this matter with your Uncle Job.&quot; 
  &quot;It won't be any use, Deacon Pitkin. Uncle Job won't interfere with   me.&quot; 
  &quot;You can't get such wages anywhere. You'll have to work for less.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps I can't get my price in Hampton,&quot; said Ben. 
  &quot;Of course you can't. There ain't no one goin' to pay you men's   wages.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps you are right, Deacon Pitkin. In that case, my mind is  made  up.&quot; 
  &quot;What will you do?&quot; asked the deacon, showing some curiosity. 
  &quot;I'll leave town.&quot; 
  &quot;It's a resky thing, Benjamin. You ain't old enough to take care of   yourself.&quot; 
  &quot;I think I can do it. Deacon Pitkin. I am not afraid to try. Still,   if you'll give me a hundred and fifty dollars and board&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;You must think I'm crazy,&quot; said the deacon hastily. &quot;I don't throw   money away that way.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I'm afraid we can't make a bargain, deacon. Here is the  store,  and I'll bid you good morning.&quot; 
  &quot;If you think better of my offer, you can let me know, Benjamin.  You  can talk it over with your uncle.&quot; 
  &quot;All right, sir. If you think better of mine, just let me know   within a week, or I may be gone from Hampton.&quot; 
  &quot;That's a cur'us boy,&quot; said the deacon meditatively. &quot;He's got the   most conceited idea of his vally to work of any boy I ever came   across. A hundred and fifty dollars and board! What'll Mrs. Pitkin   say when I tell her? She ain't much sot on the boy's comin' anyway.   She thinks he's too hearty; but I don't mind that, so much. He's   strong and good to work, an' he's the only boy in town that would   suit me.&quot; 
  &quot;I wonder what the deacon thinks of me,&quot; soliloquized Ben. &quot;I   thought I should scare him a little when I named my price. If I'd   thought he would take me at that figure, I'd have said more. It   wouldn't suit me to work for him at all.&quot; 
  In the evening Deacon Pitkin came over to see Job Stanton, and   renewed his offer for Ben's services. 
  &quot;The boy's got wild idees about pay,&quot; he said; &quot;but boys haven't   much jedgment. You're a sensible man, Mr. Stanton, and you and me  can  make a fair bargain.&quot; 
  &quot;It won't be of much use, Deacon Pitkin. Ben's got his idees, an'  he  sticks to 'em.&quot; 
  &quot;But you're his uncle. You can make him see his true interest.&quot; 
  &quot;Ben's young,&quot; said Job, suspending his work; &quot;but he's got to look   out for himself. He may make mistakes, but I've promised not to   interfere. I've got confidence in him that he'll come out right in   the end. Truth is, deacon, he don't want to work at farmin', and   that's why he asked you such a steep price. He knew you wouldn't   agree to give it.&quot; 
  This put the matter in a new light, and Deacon Pitkin reluctantly   concluded that he must abandon the idea of obtaining Ben as a helper   on his farm.
