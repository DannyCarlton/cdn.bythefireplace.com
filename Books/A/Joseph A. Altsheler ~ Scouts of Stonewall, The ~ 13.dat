  Harry, like the rest of the army, slept soundly through the rest of  the  night and they rose to a brilliant first day of June.  The scouts  said  that the whole force of Fremont was not far behind, while the  army of  Shields was marching on a parallel line east of the  Massanuttons, and  ready at the first chance to form a junction with  Fremont. 
  Youth seeks youth and Harry and Dalton found a little time to talk  with  St. Clair and Langdon. 
  &#8220;We've broken their ring and passed through,&#8221; said Langdon, &#8220;but as  sure  as we live we'll all be fighting again in a day.  If the Yankees  follow  too hard Old Jack will turn and fight 'em.  Now, why haven't  the Yankees  got sense enough to let us alone and go home?&#8221; 
  &#8220;They'll never do it,&#8221; said Dalton gravely.  &#8220;We've got to  recognize that  fact.  I'm never going to say another word about the  Yankees not being  willing to fight.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They're too darned willing,&#8221; said Happy Tom.  &#8220;That's the  trouble.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I woke up just about the dawn,&#8221; said Dalton.  &#8220;Everybody was  asleep,  but the general, and I saw him praying.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then it means fighting and lots of it,&#8221; said St. Clair.  &#8220;I'm  going to  make the best use I can of this little bit of rest, as I  don't expect  another chance for at least a month.  Stonewall Jackson  thinks that one  hour a day for play keeps Jack from being a dull boy.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Just look at our colonels, will you?&#8221; said Happy Tom.  &#8220;They're   believers in what Arthur says.&#8221; 
  Colonel Leonidas Talbot and Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire  were  sitting in a corner of a rail fence opposite each other, and  their bent  gray heads nearly touched.  But their eyes were on a small  board between  them and now and then they moved carved figures back and  forth. 
  &#8220;They're playing chess,&#8221; whispered Happy Tom.  &#8220;They found the  board and  set of men in the captured baggage, and this is their first  chance to use  them.&#8221; 
  &#8220;They can't possibly finish a game,&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;No,&#8221; said Tom, &#8220;they can't, and it's just as well.  Why anybody  wants to  play chess is more than I can understand.  I'd rather watch a  four-mile  race between two turtles.  It's a lot swifter and more  thrilling.&#8221; 
  &#8220;It takes intelligence to play chess, Happy,&#8221; said St. Clair. 
  &#8220;And time, too,&#8221; rejoined Happy.  &#8220;If a thing consumes a lifetime  anyway,  what's the use of intelligence?&#8221; 
  A bugle sounded.  The two colonels raised their gray heads and gave  the  chess men and the board to an orderly.  The four boys returned to  their  horses, and in a few minutes Jackson's army was once more on the  march,  the Acadian band near the head of the column playing as  joyously as if it  had never lost a member in battle.  The mountains  and the valley between  were bathed in light once more.  The heavy dark  green foliage on the  slopes of the Massanuttons rested the eye and the  green fields of the  valley were cheering. 
  &#8220;I don't believe I'd ever forget this valley if I lived to be a  thousand,&#8221;  said Harry.  &#8220;I've marched up and down it so much and every  second of the  time was so full of excitement.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Here's one day of peace, or at least it looks so,&#8221; said Dalton. 
  But Jackson beckoned to Harry, bade him ride to the rear and report  if  there was any sign of the enemy.  They had learned to obey quickly  and  Harry galloped back by the side of the marching army.  Even now  the men  were irrepressible and he was saluted with the old familiar  cries: 
  &#8220;Hey, Johnny Reb, come back!  You're going toward the Yankees, not  away  from 'em.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Let him go ahead, Bill.  He's goin' to tell the Yankees to stop or  he'll  hurt 'em.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That ain't the way to ride a hoss, bub.  Don't set up so straight  in the  saddle.&#8221; 
  Harry paid no attention to this disregard of his dignity as an  officer.  He had long since become used to it, and, if they enjoyed it,  he was glad  to furnish the excuse.  He reached the rear guard of  scouts and  skirmishers, and, turning his horse, kept with them for a  while, but they  saw nothing.  Sherburne, with a detachment of the  cavalry was there,  and Ashby, who commanded all the horse, often  appeared. 
  &#8220;Fremont's army is not many miles behind,&#8221; said Sherburne.  &#8220;If we  were  to ride a mile or two toward it we could see its dust.  But the  Yanks are  tired and they can't march fast.  I wish I knew how far up  the Luray  Shields and his army are.  We've got to look out for that  junction of  Shields and Fremont.&#8221; 
  &#8220;We'll pass the Gap before they can make the junction,&#8221; said Harry   confidently. 
  &#8220;How's Old Jack looking?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Same as ever.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That is, like a human sphinx.  Well, you can never tell from his  face  what he's thinking, but you can be sure that he's thinking  something  worth while.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You think then I can report to him that the pursuit will not catch  up  to-day?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I'm sure of it.  I've talked with Ashby also about it and he says   they're yet too far back.  Harry, what day is this?&#8221; 
  Harry smiled at the sudden question, but he understood how  Sherburne,  amid almost continuous battle, had lost sight of time. 
  &#8220;I heard someone say it was the first of June,&#8221; he replied. 
  &#8220;No later than that?  Why, it seemed to me that it must be nearly  autumn.  Do you know, Harry, that on this very day, two years ago, I  was up there  in those mountains to the west with a jolly camping  party.  I was just a  boy then, and now here I am an old man.&#8221; 
  &#8220;About twenty-three, I should say.&#8221; 
  &#8220;A good guess, but anyway I've been through enough to make me feel  sixty.  I promise you, Harry, that if ever I get through this war alive  I'll  shoot the man who tries to start another.  Look at the fields!   How fine  and green they are!  Think of all that good land being torn  up by the  hoofs of cavalry and the wheels of cannon!&#8221; 
  &#8220;If you are going to be sentimental I'll leave you,&#8221; said Harry,  and the  action followed the word.  He rode away, because he was afraid  he would  grow sentimental himself. 
  The army continued its peaceful march up the valley and most of the  night  that followed.  Harry was allowed to obtain a few hours sleep in  the  latter part of the night in one of the captured wagons.  It was a  covered  wagon and he selected it because he noticed that the night,  even if it  was the first of June, was growing chill.  But he had no  time to be  particular about the rest.  He did not undress&#8212;he had not  undressed in  days&#8212;but lying between two sacks of meal with his head  on a third sack  he sank into a profound slumber. 
  When Harry awoke he felt that the wagon was moving.  He also heard  the  patter of rain on his canvas roof.  It was dusky in there, but he  saw in  front of him the broad back of the teamster who sat on the  cross seat and  drove. 
  &#8220;Hello!&#8221; exclaimed Harry, sitting up.  &#8220;What's happened?&#8221; 
  A broad red face was turned to him, and a voice issuing from a slit   almost all the way across its breadth replied: 
  &#8220;Well, if little old Rip Van Winkle hasn't waked up at last!  Why,   you've slept nigh on to four hours, and nobody in Stonewall Jackson's   army is ever expected to sleep more'n three and that's gospel truth,   as shore's my name is Sam Martin.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But, Sam, you don't tell me what's happened!&#8221; 
  &#8220;It's as simple as A, B, C.  We're movin' ag'in, and that fine June  day  yestiddy that we liked so much is gone forever.  The second o'  June ain't  one little bit like the first o' June.  It's cold and it's  wet.  Can't  you hear the rain peltin' on the canvas?  Besides, the  Yanks are comin'  up, too.  I done heard the boomin' o' cannon off  there toward the rear.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, why wasn't I called!  Here I am sleeping away, and the enemy  is  already in touch with us!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Don't you worry any 'bout that, sonny.  Don't you be so anxious to  git  into a fight, 'cause you'll have plenty of chances when you can't  keep  out o' it.  'Sides, Gin'ral Jackson ain't been expectin' you.   We're up  near the head o' the line an' 'bout an hour ago when we was  startin' a  whiskered man on a little sorrel hoss rid up an' said:  'Which o' my staff  have you got in there?  I remember 'signin' one to  you last night.'  I bows very low an' I says: 'Gin'ral Jackson, I don't  know his name.  He was too sleepy to give it, but he's a real young  fellow, nice an'  quiet.  He ain't give no trouble at all.  He's been  sleepin' so hard I  think he has pounded his ear clean through one o'  them bags o' meal.'  Gin'ral Jackson laughs low an' just a little, and  then he takes a peek  into the wagon.  'Why, it's young Harry Kenton!'  he says.  'Let him sleep  on till he wakes.  He deserves it!'  Then he  lets fall the canvas an' he  ups an' rides away.  An' if I was in your  place, young Mr. Kenton,  I'd feel mighty proud to have Stonewall  Jackson say that I deserved more  rest.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am proud, but I've got to go now.  I don't know where I'll find  my  horse.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I know, an' what's more I'll tell.  An orderly came back with him   saddled an' bridled an' he's hitched to this here wagon o' mine.   Good-bye, Mr. Kenton, I'm sorry you're goin' 'cause you've been a  nice,  pleasant boarder, sayin' nothin' an' givin' no trouble.&#8221; 
  Harry thanked him, and then in an instant was out of the wagon and  on his  horse.  It required only a few minutes to overtake Jackson and  his staff,  who were riding soberly along in the rain.  He noticed with  relief that  he was not the last to join the chief.  Two or three  others came up  later.  Jackson nodded pleasantly to them all as they  came. 
  But the morning was gloomy in the extreme.  Harry was glad to  shelter  himself with the heavy cavalry cloak from the cold rain.  All  the skies  were covered with sullen clouds, and the troops trudged  silently on in  deep mud.  Now and then a wind off the mountains  threshed the rain  sharply into their faces.  From the rear came the  deep, sullen mutter  which Harry so readily recognized as the sound of  the big guns.  Sam  Martin was right.  The enemy was most decidedly &#8220;in  touch.&#8221; 
  Dalton handed Harry some cold food and he ate it in the saddle.   Jackson  rode on saying nothing, his head bowed a little, his gaze far  away.  The officers of his staff were also silent.  Jackson after a  while reined  his horse out of the road, and his staff, of course,  followed.  The  troops filed past and Jackson said: 
  &#8220;We will soon pass the Gap in the Massanuttons, and Shields cannot  come  out there ahead of us.  That danger is left behind.&#8221; 
  &#8220;What of the junction between Shields and Fremont, General?&#8221; asked  one of  the older officers. 
  Jackson cast one glance at the somber heavens. 
  &#8220;Providence favors us,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;The south fork of the Shenandoah  flows  between Fremont and Shields.  It is swollen already by the rains  and the  rushing torrents from the mountains, and if I read the skies  right we're  going to have other long and heavy rains.  They can't ford  the Shenandoah  and they can't stop to bridge it.  It will be a long  time before they can  bring a united force against us.&#8221; 
  But while he spoke the mutter of the guns grew louder.  Jackson  listened  attentively a long time, and then sent several of his staff  officers to  the rear with orders to the cavalry, the Invincibles under  Talbot,  and one other regiment to hold the enemy off at all costs.  As  Harry  galloped back the mutter of the cannon grew into thunder.  There  was also  the sharper crash of rifle fire.  Presently he saw the flash  of the  firing and numerous spires of smoke rising. 
  His own message was to the Invincibles and he delivered the brief  note to  Colonel Talbot, who read it quickly and then tore it up. 
  &#8220;Stay with us a while, Harry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and you can then report  more  fully to the general what is going on.  They crowd us hard.  Look  how  their sharpshooters are swarming in the woods and fields yonder.&#8221; 
  An orchard to the left of the road and only a short distance away  was  filled with the Union riflemen.  Running from tree to tree and  along the  fences they sent bullets straight into the ranks of the  Invincibles.  Four guns were turned and swept the orchard with shell,  but the wary  sharpshooters darted to another point, and again came the  hail of  bullets.  Colonel Talbot bade his weary men turn, but at the  moment,  Sherburne, with a troop of cavalry, swept down on the riflemen  and sent  them flying.  Harry saw Colonel Talbot's lips moving, and he  knew that he  was murmuring thanks because Sherburne had come so  opportunely. 
  &#8220;We're not having an easy time,&#8221; he said to Harry.  &#8220;They press us  hard.  We drive them back for a time, and they come again.  They have  field guns,  too, and they are handled with great skill.  If I do not  mistake greatly,  they are under the charge of Carrington, who, you  remember, fought us at  that fort in the valley before Bull Run, John  Carrington, old John  Carrington, my classmate at West Point, a man who  wouldn't hurt a fly,  but who is the most deadly artillery officer in  the world.&#8221; 
  Harry remembered that famous duel of the guns in the hills and  Colonel  Talbot's admiration of his opponent, Carrington.  Now he could  see it  shining in his eyes as strongly as ever. 
  &#8220;Why are you so sure, colonel, that it's Carrington?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;Because nobody else could handle those field guns as he does.  He  brings  'em up, sends the shot and shell upon us, then hitches up like  lightning,  is away before we can charge, and in a minute or two is  firing into our  line elsewhere.  Trust Carrington for such work, and  I'm glad he hasn't  been killed.  John's the dearest soul in the world,  as gentle as a woman.  Down!  Down! all of you!  There are the muzzles  of his guns in the bushes  again!&#8221; 
  Colonel Talbot's order was so sharp and convincing that most of the   Invincibles mechanically threw themselves upon their faces, just as  four  field pieces crashed and the shell and shrapnel flew over their  heads.  That rapid order had saved them, but the officers on horseback  were not  so lucky.  A captain was killed, Lieutenant-Colonel St.  Hilaire was  grazed on the shoulder, and the horse of Colonel Talbot  was killed under  him. 
  But Colonel Talbot, alert and agile, despite his years, sprang  clear of  the falling horse and said emphatically to his second in  command,  Lieutenant-Colonel Hector St. Hilaire: 
  &#8220;The last doubt is gone!  It's Carrington as sure as we live!&#8221; 
  Then he gave a quick order to his men to rise and fire with the  rifles,  but the woods protected the gunners, and, when Sherburne with  his cavalry  charged into the forest, Carrington and his guns were  gone. 
  Colonel Talbot procured another horse, and the Invincibles, sore of  body  and mind, resumed their slow and sullen retreat.  Harry left them  and  rode further along the front of the rear guard.  Under the somber  skies  and in the dripping rain there was a long line of flashing  rifles and the  flaming of big guns at intervals. 
  Fremont was pushing the pursuit and pushing it hard.  Harry  recognized  anew the surpassing skill of Jackson in keeping his enemies  separated by  mountains and streams, while his own concentrated force  marched on.  He felt that Fremont would hold Jackson in battle if he  could until the  other Northern armies came up, and he felt also that  Jackson would lead  Fremont beyond a junction with the others and then  turn.  Yet these  Northern men were certainly annoying.  They did not  seem to mind defeats.  Here they were fighting as hard as ever,  pursuing and not pursued. 
  Harry, turning to the left, saw a numerous body of cavalry under  Ashby,  supported by guns also, and he joined them.  Ashby on his  famous white  horse was riding here and there, exposing himself again  and again to the  fire of the enemy, who was pressing close.  He nodded  to Harry, whom he  knew. 
  &#8220;You can report to General Jackson,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that the enemy is   continually attacking, but that we are continually beating him off.&#8221; 
  Just as he spoke a trumpet sounded loud and clear in the edge of a  wood  only three or four hundred yards away.  There was a tremendous  shout from  many men, and then the thunder of hoofs.  A cavalry  detachment, more than  a thousand strong, rushed down upon them, and to  right and left of the  horse, regiments of infantry, supported by field  batteries, charged also. 
  The movement was so sudden, so violent and so well-conceived that  Ashby's  troops were swept away, despite every effort of the leader,  who galloped  back and forth on his white horse begging them to stand.   So powerful was  the rush that the cavalry were finally driven in  retreat and with them  the Invincibles. 
  Some of the troops, worn by battles and marches until the will  weakened  with the body, broke and ran up the road.  Harry heard behind  him the  triumphant shouts of their pursuers and he saw the Northern  bayonets  gleaming as they came on in masses.  Ashby was imploring his  men to stand  but they would not.  The columns pressing upon them were  too heavy and  they scarcely had strength enough left to fight. 
  More and yet more troops came into battle.  The Northern success  for the  time was undoubted.  The men in blue were driving in the  Southern rear  guard, and Ashby was unable to hold the road. 
  But the two colonels at last succeeded in drawing the Invincibles  across  the turnpike, where they knelt in good order and sent volley  after volley  into the pursuing ranks.  Fremont's men wavered and then  stopped, and  Ashby, upbraiding his horsemen and calling their  attention to the  resolute stand of the infantry, brought them into  action again.  Infantry  and cavalry then uniting, drove back the  Northern vanguard, and, for the  time being, the Southern rear guard  was safe once more. 
  But the Invincibles and the cavalry were almost exhausted.  Harry  found  St. Clair wounded, not badly, but with enough loss of blood for  Colonel  Talbot to send him to one of the wagons.  He insisted that he  was still  fit to help hold the road, but Colonel Talbot ordered two of  the soldiers  to put him in the wagon and he was compelled to submit. 
  &#8220;We can't let you die now from loss of blood, you young  fire-eater,&#8221;  said Colonel Talbot severely, &#8220;because you may be able to  serve us better  by getting killed later on.&#8221; 
  St. Clair smiled wanly and with his formal South Carolina  politeness said: 
  &#8220;Thanks, sir, it helps a lot when you're able to put it in such a   satisfactory way.&#8221; 
  Harry, who was unhurt, gave St. Clair a strong squeeze of the hand. 
  &#8220;You'll be up and with us again soon, Arthur,&#8221; he said consolingly,   and then he rode away to Ashby. 
  &#8220;You may tell General Jackson that we can hold them back,&#8221; said the   cavalry leader grimly.  &#8220;You have just seen for yourself.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have, sir,&#8221; replied Harry, and he galloped away from the rear.   But he soon met the general himself, drawn by the uncommonly heavy   firing.  Harry told him what had happened, but the expression of   Jackson's face did not change. 
  &#8220;A rather severe encounter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but Ashby can hold them.&#8221; 
  All that day, nearly all that night and all the following day Harry   passed between Jackson and Ashby or with them.  It was well for the   Virginians that they were practically born on horseback and were  trained  to open air and the forests.  For thirty-six hours the cavalry  were in  the saddle almost without a break.  And so was Harry.  He had  forgotten  all about food and rest.  He was in a strange, excited mood.   He seemed  to see everything through a red mist.  In all the  thirty-six hours the  crash of rifles or the thud of cannon ceased  scarcely for a moment.  It went on just the same in day or in night.   The Northern troops,  although led by no such general as Stonewall  Jackson, showed the splendid  stuff of which they were made.  They were  always eager to push hard and  yet harder. 
  The Southern troops burnt the bridges over the creeks as they  retreated,  but the Northern men waded through the water and followed.   The clouds of  cavalry were always in touch.  A skirmish was  invariably proceeding at  some point.  Toward evening of the second  day's pursuit, they came to  Mount Jackson, to which they had retreated  once before, and there went  into camp in a strong place. 
  But the privates themselves knew that they could not stay there  long.  They might turn and beat off Fremont's army, but then they would  have to  reckon with the second army under Shields and the yet heavier  masses that  McDowell was bringing up.  But Jackson himself gave no  sign of  discouragement.  He went cheerfully among the men, and saw  that attention,  as far as possible at such a time, was given to their  needs.  Harry  hunted up St. Clair and found him with a bandaged  shoulder sitting in his  wagon.  He was sore but cheerful. 
  &#8220;The doctor tells me, Harry, that I can take my place in the line  in  three more days,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I intend to make it two.  I fancy  that we  need all the men we can get now, and that I won't be driven  back to this  wagon.&#8221; 
  &#8220;If I were as well fixed as you are, Arthur,&#8221; said Langdon, who  appeared  at this moment on the other side of the wagon, &#8220;I'd stay  where I was.  But it's so long since I've been hauled that I'm afraid  the luxury would  overpower me.  Think of lying on your back and  letting the world float  peacefully by!  Did I say 'think of it'?  I  was wrong.  It is  unthinkable.  Now, Harry, what plans has Old Jack  got for us?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Well, he'll get us out of this.  We're sure of that.  But when?   That's  the question.&#8221; 
  The question remained without an answer.  Early the next morning  they  were on the march again under lowering skies.  The heavens from  horizon  to horizon were a sodden gray and began to drip rain.  Harry  was sent  again to the rear-guard, where Ashby's cavalry hung like a  curtain,  backed by the Invincibles and one or two other skeleton  regiments. 
  Harry joined Sherburne and now the drip of the rain became a steady  beat.  Chilling winds from the mountains swept over them.  He had  preserved  through thick and thin, through battle and through march  that big cavalry  cloak, and now he buttoned it tightly around him. 
  He saw down the road puffs of smoke and heard the lashing fire of  rifles,  but it did not make his pulses beat any faster now.  He had  grown so used  to it that it seemed to be his normal life.  A bullet  fired from a rifle  of longer range than the others plumped into the  mud at the feet of his  horse, but he paid no attention to it. 
  He joined Sherburne, who was using his glasses, watching through  the  heavy, thick air the Northern advance.  The brilliant young  cavalryman,  while as bold and enduring as ever, had changed greatly in  the last two  or three weeks.  The fine uniform was stained and  bedraggled.  Sherburne  himself had lost more than twenty pounds and  his face was lined and  anxious far more than the face of a mere boy of  twenty-three should have  been. 
  &#8220;I think they'll press harder than ever,&#8221; said Sherburne. 
  &#8220;Why?&#8221; 
  &#8220;The Shenandoah river, or rather the north fork of it, isn't far  ahead.  They'd like to coop us up against it and make us fight, while  their army  under Shields and all their other armies&#8212;God knows how  many they  have&#8212;are coming up.&#8221; 
  &#8220;The river is bridged, isn't it?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, but it takes a good while to get an army such as ours, loaded  down  with prisoners and spoil, across it, and if they rushed us just  when we  were starting over it, we'd have to turn and give battle.   Jupiter,  how it rains!  Behold the beauties of war, Harry!&#8221; 
  The wind suddenly veered a little, and with it the rain came hard  and  fast.  It seemed to blow off the mountains in sheets and for a  moment or  two Harry was blinded.  The beat of the storm upon leaves  and earth was  so hard that the cracking of the rifles was dulled and  deadened.  Nevertheless the rifle fire went on, and as well as Harry  could judge,  without any decrease in violence. 
  &#8220;Hear the bugles now!&#8221; said Sherburne.  &#8220;Their scouts are warning  them of  the approach to the Shenandoah.  They'll be coming up in a  minute or two  in heavier force.  Ah, see, Ashby understands, too!   He's massing the men  to hold them back!&#8221; 
  The rain still poured with all the violence of a deluge, but the  Northern  force, horse and cannon, pushed forward through the mud and  opened with  all their might.  Ashby's cavalry and the infantry in  support replied.  There was something grim and awful to Harry in this  fight in the raging  storm.  Now and then, he could not see the flame  of the firing for the  rain in his eyes.  By a singular chance a bullet  cut the button of his  cloak at the throat and the cloak flew open  there.  In a minute he was  soaked through and through with water, but  he did not notice it. 
  The cavalry, the Invincibles and the other regiments were making a   desperate stand in order that the army might cross the bridge of the   Shenandoah.  Harry was seized with a sort of fury.  Why should these  men  try to keep them from getting across?  It was their right to  escape.  Presently he found himself firing with his pistols into the  great pillar  of fire and smoke and rain in front of him.  Mud splashed  up by the  horses struck him in the face now and then, and stung like  gunpowder,  but he began to shout with joy when he saw that Ashby was  holding back  the Northern vanguard. 
  Ahead of him the Southern army was already rumbling over the  bridge,  while the swollen and unfordable waters of the Shenandoah  raced beneath  it.  But the Northern brigades pressed hard.  Harry did  not know whether  the rain helped them or hurt them, but at any rate it  was terribly  uncomfortable.  It poured on them in sheets and sheets  and the earth  seemed to be a huge quagmire.  He wondered how the men  were able to keep  their ammunition dry enough to fire, but that they  did was evident from  the crash that went on without ceasing. 
  &#8220;In thinking of war before I really knew it,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;I never   thought much of weather.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Does sound commonplace, but it cuts a mighty big figure I can tell  you.  If it hadn't rained so hard just before Waterloo Napoleon would  have got  up his big guns more easily, winning the battle, and perhaps  changing the  history of the world.  Confound it, look at that crowd  pushing forward  through the field to take us in the flank!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Western men, I think,&#8221; said Harry.  &#8220;Here are two of our field  guns,  Sherburne!  Get 'em to throw some grape in there!&#8221; 
  It was lucky that the guns approached at that moment.  Their  commander,  as quick of eye as either Harry or Sherburne, unlimbered  and swept back  the western men who were seeking to turn their flank.   Then Sherburne,  with a charge of his cavalry, sent them back further.   But at the call of  Ashby's trumpet they turned quickly and galloped  after Jackson's army,  the main part of which had now passed the  bridge. 
  &#8220;I suppose we'll burn the bridge after we cross it,&#8221; said Harry. 
  &#8220;Of course.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But how on earth can we set fire to it with this Noah's flood  coming  down?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I don't know.  They'll manage it somehow.  Look, Harry, see the  flames  bursting from the timbers now.  Gallop, men!  Gallop!  We may  get our  faces scorched in crossing the bridge, but when we're on the  other side  it won't be there for the Yankees!&#8221; 
  The Invincibles and the other infantry regiments all were advancing  at  the double quick, with the cavalry closing up the rear.  Behind  them many  bugles rang and through the dense rain they saw the Northern  cavalry  leaders swinging their sabers and cheering on their men, and  they also  saw behind them the heavy masses of infantry coming up. 
  Harry knew that it was touch-and-go.  The bulk of the army was  across,  and if necessary they must sacrifice Ashby's cavalry, but that  sacrifice  would be too great.  Harry had never seen Ashby and his  gallant captains  show more courage.  They fought off the enemy to the  very last and then  galloped for the bridge, under a shower of shell  and grape and bullets.  Ashby's own horse was killed under him, falling  headlong in the mud,  but in an instant somebody supplied him with a  fresh one, upon which he  leaped, and then they thundered over the  burning bridge, Ashby and  Sherburne the last two to begin the  crossing. 
  Harry, who was just ahead of Ashby and Sherburne, felt as if the  flames  were licking at them.  With an involuntary motion he threw up  his hands  to protect his eyes from the heat, and he also had a  horrible sensation  lest the bridge, its supporting timbers burned  through, should fall,  sending them all into the rushing flood. 
  But the bridge yet held and Harry uttered a gasp of relief as the  feet of  his horse struck the deep mud on the other side.  They  galloped on for  two or three hundred yards, and then at the command of  Ashby turned. 
  The bridge was a majestic sight, a roaring pyramid that shot forth  clouds  of smoke and sparks in myriads. 
  &#8220;How under the sun did we cross it?&#8221; Harry exclaimed. 
  &#8220;We crossed it, that's sure, because here we are,&#8221; said Sherburne.   &#8220;I confess myself that I don't know just how we did it, Harry, but  it's  quite certain that the enemy will never cross it.  The fire's too  strong.  Besides, they'd have our men to face.&#8221; 
  Harry looked about, and saw several thousand men drawn up to  dispute the  passage, but the Northern troops recognizing its  impossibility at that  time, made no attempt.  Nevertheless their  cannon sent shells curving  over the stream, and the Southern cannon  sent curving shells in reply.  But the burning bridge roared louder and  the pyramid of flame rose  higher.  The rain, which had never ceased to  pour in a deluge, merely  seemed to feed it. 
  &#8220;Ah, she's about to go now,&#8221; exclaimed Sherburne. 
  The bridge seemed to Harry to rear up before his eyes like a living  thing,  and then draw together a mass of burning timbers.  The next  moment the  whole went with a mighty crash into the river, and the  blazing fragments  floated swiftly away on the flood.  The deep and  rapid Shenandoah flowed  a barrier between the armies of Jackson and  Fremont. 
  &#8220;A river can be very beautiful without a bridge, Harry, can't it?&#8221;   said a voice beside him. 
  It was St. Clair, a heavy bandage over his left shoulder, but a  smoking  rifle in his right hand, nevertheless. 
  &#8220;I couldn't stand it any longer, Harry,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I had to get up  and  join the Invincibles, and you see I'm all right.&#8221; 
  Harry was compelled to laugh at the sodden figure, from which the  rain  ran in streams.  But he admired St. Clair's spirit. 
  &#8220;It was by a hair's breadth, Arthur,&#8221; he said. 
  &#8220;But we won across, just the same, and now I'm going back to that  wagon  to finish my cure.  I fancy that we'll now have a rest of six or  eight  hours, if General Jackson doesn't think so much time taken from  war a  mere frivolity.&#8221; 
  The Southern army drew off slowly, but as soon as it was out of  sight the  tenacious Northern troops undertook to follow.  They  attempted to build a  bridge of boats, but the flood was so heavy that  they were swept away.  Then Fremont set men to work to rebuild the  bridge, which they could do  in twenty-four hours, but Jackson,  meanwhile, was using every one of  those precious hours.
