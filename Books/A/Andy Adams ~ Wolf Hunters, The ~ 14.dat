  Rod had sunk into the snow close to the dead man. His endurance was  gone and he was as weak as a child. He watched every movement Mukoki  made; saw every start, every glance, and became almost sick with fear  whenever the warrior bent down to examine some object.
  Was Wabi dead&#8212;and burned in those ruins?
  Foot by foot Mukoki searched. His feet became hot; the smell of  burning leather filled his nostrils; glowing coals burned through to  his feet. But the old Indian was beyond pain. Only two things filled  his soul. One of these was love for Minnetaki; the other was love for  Wabigoon. And there was only one other thing that could take the place  of these, and that was merciless, undying, savage passion&#8212;passion at  any wrong or injury that might be done to them. The Woongas had sneaked  upon Wabi. He knew that. They had caught him unaware, like cowards; and  perhaps he was dead&#8212;and in those ruins!
  He searched until his feet were scorched and burned in a score of  places, and then he came out, smoke-blackened, but with some of the  terrible look gone out of his face.
  &#8220;He no there!&#8221; he said, speaking for the first time.
  Again he crouched beside the dead man, and grimaced at Rod with a  triumphant, gloating chuckle.
  &#8220;Much dead!&#8221; he grinned.
  In a moment the grimace had gone from his face, and while Rod still  rested he continued his examination of the camp. Close around it the  snow was beaten down with human tracks. Mukoki saw where the outlaws  had stolen up behind the cabin from the forest and he saw where they  had gone away after the attack.
  Five had come down from the cedars, only four had gone away!
  Where was Wabi?
  If he had been captured, and taken with the Indians, there would  have been five trails. Rod understood this as well as Mukoki, and he  also understood why his companion went back to make another  investigation of the smoldering ruins. This second search, however,  convinced the Indian that Wabi's body had not been thrown into the  fire. There was only one conclusion to draw. The youth had made a  desperate fight, had killed one of the outlaws, and after being wounded  in the conflict had been carried off bodily. Wabi and his captors could  not be more than two or three miles away. A quick pursuit would  probably overtake them within an hour.
  Mukoki came to Rod's side.
  &#8220;Me follow&#8212;kill!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Me kill so many quick!&#8221; He pointed  toward the four trails. &#8220;You stay&#8212;&#8221;
  Rod clambered to his feet.
  &#8220;You mean we'll kill 'em, Muky,&#8221; he broke in. &#8220;I can follow you  again. Set the pace!&#8221;
  There came the click of the safety on Mukoki's rifle, and Rod,  following suit, cocked his own.
  &#8220;Much quiet,&#8221; whispered the Indian when they had come to the farther  side of the dip. &#8220;No noise&#8212;come up still&#8212;shoot!&#8221;
  The snow-shoe trail of the outlaws turned from the dip into the  timbered bottoms to the north, and Mukoki, partly crouched, his rifle  always to the front, followed swiftly. They had not progressed a  hundred yards into the plain when the old hunter stopped, a puzzled  look in his face. He pointed to one of the snow-shoe trails which was  much deeper than the others.
  &#8220;Heem carry Wabi,&#8221; he spoke softly. &#8220;But&#8212;&#8221; His eyes gleamed in  sudden excitement. &#8220;They go slow! They no hurry! Walk very slow! Take  much time!&#8221;
  Rod now observed for the first time that the individual tracks made  by the outlaws were much shorter than their own, showing that instead  of being in haste they were traveling quite slowly. This was a mystery  which was not easy to explain. Did the Woongas not fear pursuit? Was it  possible that they believed the hunters would not hasten to give them  battle? Or were they relying upon the strength of their numbers, or,  perhaps, planning some kind of ambush?
  Mukoki's advance now became slower and more cautious. His keen eyes  took in every tree and clump of bushes ahead. Only when he could see  the trail leading straight away for a considerable distance did he  hasten the pursuit. Never for an instant did he turn his head to Rod.  But suddenly he caught sight of something that brought from him a  guttural sound of astonishment. A fifth track had joined the trail!  Without questioning Rod knew what it meant. Wabi had been lowered from  the back of his captor and was now walking. He was on snow-shoes and  his strides were quite even and of equal length with the others.  Evidently he was not badly wounded.
  Half a mile ahead of them was a high hill and between them and this  hill was a dense growth of cedar, filled with tangled windfalls. It was  an ideal place for an ambush, but the old warrior did not hesitate. The  Woongas had followed a moose trail, with which they were apparently  well acquainted, and in this traveling was easy. But Rod gave an  involuntary shudder as he gazed ahead into the chaotic tangle through  which it led. At any moment he expected to hear the sharp crack of a  rifle and to see Mukoki tumble forward upon his face. Or there might be  a fusillade of shots and he himself might feel the burning sting that  comes with rifle death. At the distance from which they would shoot the  outlaws could not miss. Did not Mukoki realize this? Maddened by the  thought that his beloved Wabi was in the hands of merciless enemies,  was the old pathfinder becoming reckless?
  But when he looked into his companion's face and saw the cool deadly  resolution glittering in his eyes, the youth's confidence was restored.  For some reason Mukoki knew that there would not be an ambush.
  Over the moose-run the two traveled more swiftly and soon they came  to the foot of the high hill. Up this the Woongas had gone, their trail  clearly defined and unswerving in its direction. Mukoki now paused with  a warning gesture to Rod, and pointed down at one of the snow-shoe  tracks. The snow was still crumbling and falling about the edges of  this imprint.
  &#8220;Ver' close!&#8221; whispered the Indian.
  It was not the light of the game hunt in Mukoki's eyes now; there  was a trembling, terrible tenseness in his whispered words. He crept up  the hill with Rod so near that he could have touched him. At the summit  of that hill he dragged himself up like an animal, and then, crouching,  ran swiftly to the opposite side, his rifle within six inches of his  shoulder. In the plain below them was unfolded to their eyes a scene  which, despite his companion's warning, wrung an exclamation of dismay  from Roderick's lips.
  [Illustration: The leader stopped in his snow-shoes]
  Plainly visible to them in the edge of the plain were the outlaw  Woongas and their captive. They were in single file, with Wabi  following the leader, and the hunters perceived that their comrade's  arms were tied behind him.
  But it was another sight that caused Rod's dismay.
  From an opening beside a small lake half a mile beyond the Indians  below there rose the smoke of two camp-fires, and Mukoki and he could  make out at least a score of figures about these fires.
  Within rifle-shot of them, almost within shouting distance, there  was not only the small war party that had attacked the camp, but a  third of the fighting men of the Woonga tribe! Rod understood their  terrible predicament. To attack the outlaws in an effort to rescue Wabi  meant that an overwhelming force would be upon them within a few  minutes; to allow Wabi to remain a captive meant&#8212;he shuddered at the  thought of what it might mean, for he knew of the merciless vengeance  of the Woongas upon the House of Wabinosh.
  And while he was thinking of these things the faithful old warrior  beside him had already formed his plan of attack. He would die with  Wabi, gladly&#8212;a fighting, terrible slave to devotion to the last; but  he would not see Wabi die alone. A whispered word, a last look at his  rifle, and Mukoki hurried down into the plains.
  At the foot of the hill he abandoned the outlaw trail and Rod  realized that his plan was to sweep swiftly in a semicircle, surprising  the Woongas from the front or side instead of approaching from the  rear. Again he was taxed to his utmost to keep pace with the avenging  Mukoki. Less than ten minutes later the Indian peered cautiously from  behind a clump of hazel, and then looked back at Rod, a smile of  satisfaction on his face.
  &#8220;They come,&#8221; he breathed, just loud enough to hear. &#8220;They come!&#8221;
  Rod peered over his shoulder, and his heart smote mightily within  him. Unconscious of their peril the Woongas were approaching two  hundred yards away. Mukoki gazed into his companion's face and his eyes  were almost pleading as he laid a bronzed crinkled hand upon the white  boy's arm.
  &#8220;You take front man&#8212;ahead of Wabi,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I take other  t'ree. See that tree&#8212;heem birch, with bark off? Shoot heem there. You  no tremble? You no miss?&#8221;
  &#8220;No,&#8221; replied Rod. He gripped the red hand in his own. &#8220;I'll kill,  Mukoki. I'll kill him dead&#8212;in one shot!&#8221;
  They could hear the voices of the outlaws now, and soon they saw  that Wabi's face was disfigured with blood.
  Step by step, slowly and carelessly, the Woongas approached. They  were fifty yards from the marked birch now&#8212;forty&#8212;thirty&#8212;now only  ten. Roderick's rifle was at his shoulder. Already it held a deadly  bead on the breast of the leader.
  Five yards more&#8212;
  The outlaw passed behind the tree; he came out, and the young hunter  pressed the trigger. The leader stopped in his snow-shoes. Even before  he had crumpled down into a lifeless heap in the snow a furious volley  of shots spat forth from Mukoki's gun, and when Rod swung his own rifle  to join again in the fray he found that only one of the four was  standing, and he with his hands to his breast as he tottered about to  fall. But from some one of those who had fallen there had gone out a  wild, terrible cry, and even as Rod and Makoki rushed out to free  Wabigoon there came an answering yell from the direction of the Woonga  camp.
  Mukoki's knife was in his hand by the time he reached Wabi, and with  one or two slashes he had released his hands.
  &#8220;You hurt&#8212;bad?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;No&#8212;no!&#8221; replied Wabi. &#8220;I knew you'd come, boys&#8212;dear old friends!&#8221;
  As he spoke he turned to the fallen leader and Rod saw him take  possession of the rifle and revolver which he had lost in their fight  with the Woongas weeks before. Mukoki had already spied their precious  pack of furs on one of the outlaw's backs, and he flung it over his  own.
  &#8220;You saw the camp?&#8221; queried Wabi excitedly.
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;They will be upon us in a minute! Which way, Mukoki?&#8221;
  &#8220;The chasm!&#8221; half shouted Rod. &#8220;The chasm! If we can reach the  chasm&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;The chasm!&#8221; reiterated Wabigoon.
  Mukoki had fallen behind and motioned for Wabi and Rod to take the  lead. Even now he was determined to take the brunt of danger by  bringing up the rear.
  There was no time for argument and Wabigoon set off at a rapid pace.  From behind there came the click of shells as the Indian loaded his  rifle on the run. While the other two had been busy at the scene of the  ambush Rod had replaced his empty shell, and now, as he led, Wabi  examined the armament that had been stolen from them by the outlaws.
  &#8220;How many shells have you got, Rod?&#8221; he asked over his shoulder.
  &#8220;Forty-nine.&#8221;
  &#8220;There's only four left in this belt besides five in the gun,&#8221;  called back the Indian youth. &#8220;Give me&#8212;some.&#8221;
  Without halting Rod plucked a dozen cartridges from his belt and  passed them on.
  Now they had reached the hill. At its summit they paused to recover  their breath and take a look at the camp.
  The fires were deserted. A quarter of a mile out on the plain they  saw half a dozen of their pursuers speeding toward the hill. The rest  were already concealed in the nearer thickets of the bottom.
  &#8220;We must beat them to the chasm!&#8221; said the young Indian.
  As he spoke Wabi turned and led the way again.
  Rod's heart fell like a lump within him. We must beat them to the  chasm! Those words of Wabi's brought him to the terrible realization  that his own powers of endurance were rapidly ebbing. His race behind  Mukoki to the burning cabin had seemed to rob the life from the muscles  of his limbs, and each step now added to his weakness. And the chasm  was a mile beyond the dip, and the entrance into that chasm still two  miles farther. Three miles! Could he hold out?
  He heard Mukoki thumping along behind him; ahead of him Wabi was  unconsciously widening the distance between them. He made a powerful  effort to close the breach, but it was futile. Then from close in his  rear there came a warning halloo from the old Indian, and Wabi turned.
  &#8220;He run t'ree mile to burning cabin,&#8221; said Mukoki. &#8220;He no make  chasm!&#8221;
  Rod was deathly white and breathing so hard that he could not speak.  The quick-witted Wabi at once realized their situation.
  &#8220;There is just one thing for us to do, Muky. We must stop the  Woongas at the dip. We'll fire down upon them from the top of the hill  beyond the lake. We can drop three or four of them and they won't dare  to come straight after us then. They will think we are going to fight  them from there and will take time to sneak around us. Meanwhile we'll  get a good lead in the direction of the chasm.&#8221;
  He led off again, this time a little slower. Three minutes later  they entered into the dip, crossed it safely, and were already at the  foot of the hill, when from the opposite side of the hollow there came  a triumphant blood-curdling yell.
  &#8220;Hurry!&#8221; shouted Wabi. &#8220;They see us!&#8221; Even as he spoke there came  the crack of a rifle.
  Bzzzzzzz-inggggg!
  For the first time in his life Rod heard that terrible death-song of  a bullet close to his head and saw the snow fly up a dozen feet beyond  the young Indian.
  For an interval of twenty seconds there was silence; then there came  another shot, and after that three others in quick succession. Wabi  stumbled.
  &#8220;Not hit!&#8221; he called, scrambling to his feet. &#8220;Confound&#8212;that rock!&#8221;
  He rose to the hilltop with Rod close behind him, and from the  opposite side of the lake there came a fusillade of half a dozen shots.  Instinctively Rod dropped upon his face. And in that instant, as he lay  in the snow, he heard the sickening thud of a bullet and a sharp sudden  cry of pain from Mukoki. But the old warrior came up beside him and  they passed into the shelter of the hilltop together.
  &#8220;Is it bad? Is it bad, Mukoki? Is it bad&#8212;&#8221; Wabi was almost sobbing  as he turned and threw an arm around the old Indian. &#8220;Are you  hit&#8212;bad?&#8221;
  Mukoki staggered, but caught himself.
  &#8220;In here,&#8221; he said, putting a hand to his left shoulder.  &#8220;She&#8212;no&#8212;bad.&#8221; He smiled, courage gleaming with pain in his eyes, and  swung off the light pack of furs. &#8220;We give 'em&#8212;devil&#8212;here!&#8221;
  Crouching, they peered over the edge of the hill. Half a dozen  Woongas had already left the cedars and were following swiftly across  the open. Others broke from the cover, and Wabi saw that a number of  them were without snow-shoes. He exultantly drew Mukoki's attention to  this fact, but the latter did not lift his eyes. In a few moments he  spoke.
  &#8220;Now we give 'em&#8212;devil!&#8221;
  Eight pursuers on snow-shoes were in the open of the dip. Six of  them had reached the lake. Rod held his fire. He knew that it was now  more important for him to recover his wind than to fight, and he drew  great drafts of air into his lungs while his two comrades leveled their  rifles. He could fire after they were done if it was necessary.
  There was slow deadly deliberation in the way Mukoki and Wabigoon  sighted along their rifle-barrels. Mukoki fired first; one shot,  two&#8212;with a second's interval between&#8212;and an outlaw half-way across  the lake pitched forward into the snow. As he fell, Wabi fired once,  and there came to their ears shriek after shriek of agony as a second  pursuer fell with a shattered leg. At the cries and shots of battle the  hot blood rushed through Rod's veins, and with an excited shout of  defiance he brought his rifle to his shoulder and in unison the three  guns sent fire and death into the dip below.
  Only three of the eight Woongas remained and they had turned and  were running toward the shelter of the cedars.
  &#8220;Hurrah!&#8221; shouted Rod.
  In his excitement he got upon his feet and sent his fifth and last  shot after the fleeing outlaws. &#8220;Hurrah! Wow! Let's go after 'em!&#8221;
  &#8220;Get down!&#8221; commanded Wabi. &#8220;Load in a hurry!&#8221;
  Clink&#8212;clink&#8212;clink sounded the new shells as Mukoki and Wabigoon  thrust them into their magazines. Five seconds more and they were  sending a terrific fusillade of shots into the edge of the cedars&#8212;ten  in all&#8212;and by the time he had reloaded his own gun Rod could see  nothing to shoot at.
  &#8220;That will hold them for a while,&#8221; spoke Wabi. &#8220;Most of them came in  too big a hurry, and without their snow-shoes, Muky. We'll beat them to  the chasm&#8212;easy!&#8221; He put an arm around the shoulders of the old Indian,  who was still lying upon his face in the snow. &#8220;Let me see, Muky&#8212;let  me see&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Chasm first,&#8221; replied Mukoki. &#8220;She no bad. No hit bone. No  bleed&#8212;much.&#8221;
  From behind Rod could see that Mukoki's coat was showing a growing  blotch of red.
  &#8220;Are you sure&#8212;you can reach the chasm?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  In proof of his assertion the wounded Indian rose to his feet and  approached the pack of furs. Wabi was ahead of him, and placed it upon  his own shoulders.
  &#8220;You and Rod lead the way,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You two know where to find the  opening into the chasm. I've never been there.&#8221;
  Mukoki started down the hill, and Rod, close behind, could hear him  breathing heavily; there was no longer fear for himself in his soul,  but for that grim faithful warrior ahead, who would die in his tracks  without a murmur and with a smile of triumph and fearlessness on his  lips.
