Alexina drew the jewel coffer from the depths of the compartment and opened  it with fingers that felt swollen and numb. But the jewels were there, and  she experienced a feeling of fleeting satisfaction. They were no part of  her fortune, for she believed that only want would ever induce her to sell  them, but at least they were her own personal treasure and a part of the  beauty of life.    
She returned the fallen box to its place and locked the little cupboard,  then took herself in hand. Neither the keeper outside the door of the vault  nor those she met above must suspect that anything was wrong with her. What  she should do she had no idea at the moment, but at all events she must  have time to think.    
She left the bank with her usual light step and her head high, and then she  motored down the Peninsula. As she passed the shipyards she saw crowds of  men standing about; some of them turned and scowled after her. They were on  strike and took her no doubt for the wife or daughter of a millionaire; and  in truth there was never any difference superficially in her appearance  from that of her wealthier friends. She had one ear instead of several hut  it was perfect of its kind. Her wardrobe was by no means as extensive as  Sibyl's or Janet's or a hundred others, but what she had came from the best  houses, that use only the costliest materials. Her face was composed and  proud. There was not a signal out, even from her brilliant expressive eyes,  of the storm within.    
Her mind was no longer stunned. It was seething with disgust and fury. How  dared he? Her own, her exclusive property, inherited and separate....She  felt at this moment exactly as she would have felt if her jewel coffer  instead of the dispatch box had been rifled; it was the instinct of  possession that had been outraged. What was hers was hers as much as the  hair on her head or the thoughts in her mind...an instinct that harked back  to the oldest of the buried civilizations...she wondered if any socialist  really had cultivated the power to feel differently. She was quite certain  that if Kirkpatrick should see a thief fleeing with his purse he would  chase him, collar him, and either chastise him then and there or drag him  to the nearest police station.    
And the thief was her husband, the man of her choice. Alexina felt that  possibly if a brother had stolen her money she would have been less bitter  because less humiliated; one did not select one's brothers....And if she  had still loved Mortimer it would have been bad enough, although no doubt  with the blindness of youthful passion she would immediately have begun to  make excuses for him, reeling a blow as it would have been. But the one  compensation she had found in her matrimonial wilderness was her pride in  the essential honor of her chosen partner, and her complete trust. If there  had been any necessity for giving a power of attorney when she went  to Europe she would have drawn it in his favor without hesitation, so  completely had she forgotten her earlier incitements to precaution....If  she had, no doubt she would have returned to find herself penniless.    
Whether he had stolen the money to speculate with or to extricate himself  from some business muddle she did not pause to wonder. He had lost it; that  was sufficiently evident from his depression. When his powers of bluff  failed him matters were serious indeed.    
He had stolen and lost. The first would have been unforgivable, but the  last was unpardonable.    
And he had taken her money as he would have taken Gora's, or his parents'  had they been alive, because however they might lash him with their  contempt, his body was safe from prison, his precious position in society  unshaken. She knew him well enough to be sure that if he had had forty  thousand dollars of some outsider's money under his hand it would have been  safe no matter what his predicament. He would have accepted the alternative  of bankruptcy without hesitation.    
But with the women of his family a man was always safe. She remembered  something that Gora had once said to the same effect....Yes, she could have  forgiven the theft of an outsider, for at least she would be spared this  sickening suffocating sensation of contempt. It was demoralizing. She hated  herself as much as she hated him. Moreover there would have been some  compensation in sending an outsider to San Quentin.    
And there was the serious problem of readjusting her life. Two thousand  dollars out of a small income was a serious deficit. Simultaneously she was  visited by another horrid thought. Mortimer had heretofore paid half the  household expenses. No doubt he was no longer in a position to pay any.  They would have to live, keep up Ballinger House, dress, pay taxes,  subscribe to charities, maintain their position in society, pay the doctor  and the dentist...a hundred and one other incidentals...out of four  thousand dollars a year. Well, it couldn't be done. They would have to  change their mode of living.    
However, that concerned her little at present. The ordeal loomed of a plain  talk with Mortimer. It was impossible to ignore the theft even had she  wished; which she did not, for it was her disposition to have things out  and over with. But it would be horrible...horribly intimate. She had always  deliberately lived on the surface with her family and friends, respected  their privacies as she held hers inviolate. As her mind flashed back over  her life she realized that this would be the first really serious personal  talk she would ever have held with any one. Or, if her family, and  occasionally, Mortimer, had insisted upon being serious she had maintained  her own attitude of airy humor or delicate insolence.    
She had no shyness of manner but a deep and intense shyness of the soul.  Some day...perhaps...but never yet.

She turned her car after a time, for she feared that her batteries would  run down. The strikers were still lounging and scowling; and this time  having relaxed her mental girths she looked at them with sympathy. She  knew from the liberal education she had received at the hands of Mr. James  Kirkpatrick, and the admissions of Judge Lawton and other thoughtful men,  that the iniquities of employers and labor were pretty equally divided;  greed and lack of tact on the one hand, greed and class hatred and the itch  for power on the part of labor leaders; and a stupidity in the mass that  was more pardonable than the short-sighted stupidities of capital....But  what would you? A few centuries hence the world might be civilized, but not  in her time. Nothing gave her mind less exercise. One thing at least was  certain and that was that when strikes lasted too long the laborers and  their families went hungry, and the employers did not. That settled the  question for her and determined the course of her sympathy. (It was not yet  the fashion to recognize the unfortunate "public," squeezed and helpless  between these two louder demonstrators of sheer human nature.)    
But her mind did not linger in the shipyards. She had problems of her  own....The chief of her compensations, having made a mess of her life, had  been taken from her: her pride and her faith in the man to whom she was  bound. The death of love had been so gradual that she had not noticed it in  time for decent obsequies; she had not sent a regret in its wake....She had  had enough left, more than many women who had made the same blind plunge  into the barbed wire maze of matrimony....And now she had nothing. She  would have liked to drive right out on to a liner about to sail through the  Golden Gate...but she would no doubt have to live on...and on...in changed,  possibly humble, conditions...despising the man she must meet sometime  every day....Yes, she did wish she never had been born.
