Granville helped him on his arm into the judge's room amid profound  silence. All the court was deeply stirred. A few personal friends  hurried after him eagerly. Among them were the Warings, and Mrs.  Clifford, and Elma.    
The judge staggered to a seat, and held Granville's hand long  and silently in his. Then his eye caught Elma's. He turned to her  gratefully. "Thank you, young lady," he said, in a very thick voice.  "You were extremely good. I forget your name. But you helped me  greatly."    
There was such a pathetic ring in those significant words, "I  forget your name," that every eye about stood dimmed with moisture.  Remorse had clearly blotted out all else now from Sir Gilbert  Gildersleeve's powerful brain save the solitary memory of his great  wrong-doing.    
"Something's upon his mind still," Elma cried, looking hard at  him. "He's dying! he's dying! But he wants to say something else  before he dies, I'm certain. ... Mr. Kelmscott, it's to you. Oh,  Cyril, stand back! Mother, leave them alone! I'm sure from his  eye he wants to say something to Mr. Kelmscott."    
They all fell back reverently. They stood in the presence of death  and of a mighty sorrow. Sir Gilbert still held Granville's hand  fast bound in his own. "It'll kill her," he muttered. "It'll kill  her! I'm sure it'll kill her! She'll never get over the thought  that her father was--was the cause of Montague Nevitt's death. And  you'll never care to marry a girl of whom people will say, either  justly or unjustly, 'She's a murderers daughter'.... And that will  kill her, too. For, Kelmscott, she loved you!"    
Granville held the dying man's hand still more gently than ever.  "Sir Gilbert," he said, leaning over him with very tender eyes,  "no event on earth could ever possibly alter Gwendoline's love for  me, or my love for Gwendoline. I know you can't live. This shock  has been too much for you. But if it will make you die any the  happier now to know that Gwendoline and I will still be one, I give  you my sacred promise at this solemn moment, that as soon as she  likes I will marry Gwendoline." He paused for a second. "I don't  understand all this story just yet," he went on. "But of one  thing I'm certain. The sympathy of every soul in court to-day went  with you as you spoke out the truth so manfully. The sympathy of  all England will go with you to-morrow when they come to learn of  it.... Sir Gilbert, till this morning I never admired you, much as  I love Gwendoline. As you made that confession just now in court,  I declare, I admired you. With all the greater confidence now will  I marry your daughter."    
They carried him to the judge's lodgings in the town, and laid  him there peaceably for the doctors to tend him. For a fortnight  the shadow of Gildersleeve still lingered on, growing feebler and  feebler in intellect every day. But the end was certain. It was  softening of the brain, and it proceeded rapidly. The horror of  that unspeakable trial had wholly unnerved him. The great, strong  man cried and sobbed like a baby. Lady Gildersleeve and Gwendoline  were with him all through. He seldom spoke. When he did, it was  generally to murmur those fixed words of exculpation, in a tremulous  undertone, "It was my hands that did it--these great, clumsy hands  of mine--not I--not I. I never, never meant it. It was an accident.  An accident. Justifiable homicide.... What I really regret is for  that poor fellow Waring."    
And at the end of a fortnight he died, once smiling, with Gwendoline's  hand locked tight in his own, and Granville Kelmscott kneeling in  tears by his bedside.    
The Kelmscott property was settled by arrangement. It never came  into court. With the aid of the family lawyers the three half-brothers  divided it amicably. Guy wouldn't hear of Granville's giving up  his claim to the house and park at Tilgate. Granville was to the  manner born, he said, and brought up to expect it; while Cyril and  he, mere waifs and strays in the world, would be much better off,  even so, with their third of the property each, than they ever  before in their lives could have counted upon. As for Cyril, he  was too happy in Guy's exculpation from the greater crime, and his  frank explanation of the lesser--under Nevitt's influence--to care  very much in his own heart what became of Tilgate.    
The only one man who objected to this arrangement was Mr. Reginald  Clifford, C.M.G., of Craighton. The Companion of the Militant  Saints was strongly of opinion that Cyril Waring oughtn't to have  given up his prior claim to the family mansion, even for valuable  consideration elsewhere. Mr. Clifford drew himself up to the full  height of his spare figure, and caught in the tight skin of his  mummy-like face rather tighter than before, as he delivered himself  of this profound opinion. "A man should consult his own dignity,"  he said stiffly, and with great precision; "if he's born to assume  a position in the county, he should assume that position as a sacred  duty. He should remember that his wife and children--"    
"But he hasn't got any wife, papa," Elma ventured to interpose,  with a bright little smile; so <i>that</i> can't count either way."    
"He hasn't a wife <i>at present</i>, to be sure; that's perfectly true,  my dear; no wife <i>at present</i>; but he will probably now, in his  existing circumstances, soon obtain one. A Man of Property should  always marry. Mr. Waring will naturally desire to ally himself to  some family of Good Position in the county; and the lady's relations  would, of course, insist--"    
"Well, it doesn't matter to us, papa," Elma answered maliciously;  "for, as far as we're concerned, you know; you've often said that  nothing on earth would ever induce you to give your consent."    
The Gentleman of Good Position in the county gazed at his daughter  aghast with horror. "My dear child," he said, with positive alarm,  "your remarks are nothing short of Revolutionary. You must remember  that since then circumstances have altered. At that time, Mr.  Waring was a painter--"    
"He's a painter still, I believe," Elma put in, parenthetically.  "The acquisition of property or county rank doesn't seem to have  had the very slightest effect one way or the other upon his drawing  or his colouring."    
Her father disdained to take notice of such flippant remarks. "At  that time," he repeated solemnly, "Mr. Waring was a painter, a mere  ordinary painter; we know him now to be the heir and representative  of a great County Family. If he were to ask you to-day--"    
"But he did ask me a long time ago, you know, papa," Elma put  in demurely. "And at that time, you remember, you objected to the  match; so of course, as in duty bound, I at once refused him."    
"And what did your father say to that, Elma?" Cyril asked, with a  smile, as she narrated the whole circumstances to him some hours  later.    
"Oh, he only said, 'But he'll ask you again now, you may be sure,  my child.' And I replied very gravely, I didn't think you would.  And do you know, Cyril, I really don't think you will, either."    
"Why not, Elma?"    
"Because, you foolish boy, it isn't the least bit in the world  necessary. This has been, all through, a comedy of errors. Tragedy  enough intermixed; but still a comedy of errors. There never was  really any reason on earth why either of us shouldn't have married  the other. And the only thing I now regret myself is that I didn't  do as I first threatened, and marry you outright, just to show  my confidence in you and Guy, at the time when everybody else had  turned most against you."    
"Well, suppose we make up for lost time now by saying Wednesday  fortnight," Cyril suggested, after a short pause, during which both  of them simultaneously had been otherwise occupied.    
"Oh, Cyril, that's awfully quick! It could hardly be managed.  There's the dresses, and all that! And the bridesmaids to arrange  about! And the invitations to issue!... But still, sooner than  put you off any longer now--well, yes, my dear boy--I dare say we  could make it Wednesday fortnight."
