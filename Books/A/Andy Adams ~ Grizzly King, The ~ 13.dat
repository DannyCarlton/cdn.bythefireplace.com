  For still another two hours Thor led Muskwa on that tiresome jaunt  into the north. They had travelled a good twenty miles since leaving  the Bighorn Highway, and to the little tan-faced cub those twenty miles  were like a journey around the world. Ordinarily he would not have gone  that far away from his birthplace until his second year, and very  possibly his third.
  Not once in this hike down the valley had Thor wasted time on the  mountain slopes. He had picked out the easiest trails along the creek.  Three or four miles below the pool where they had left the old bear he  suddenly changed this procedure by swinging due westward, and a little  later they were once more climbing a mountain. They went up a long  green slide for a quarter of a mile, and luckily for Muskwa's legs this  brought them to the smooth plainlike floor of a break which took them  without much more effort out on the slopes of the other valley. This  was the valley in which Thor had killed the black bear twenty miles to  the southward.
  From the moment Thor looked out over the northern limits of his  range a change took possession of him. All at once he lost his  eagerness to hurry. For fifteen minutes he stood looking down into the  valley, sniffing the air. He descended slowly, and when he reached the  green meadows and the creek-bottom he<I> mooshed</I> along straight in  the face of the wind, which was coming from the south and west. It did  not bring him the scent he wanted&#8212;the smell of his mate. Yet an  instinct that was more infallible than reason told him that she was  near, or should be near. He did not take accident or sickness or the  possibility of hunters having killed her into consideration. This was  where he had always started in to hunt for her, and sooner or later he  had found her. He knew her smell. And he crossed and recrossed the  bottoms so that it could not escape him.
  When Thor was love-sick he was more or less like a man: that is to  say, he was an idiot. The importance of all other things dwindled into  nothingness. His habits, which were as fixed as the stars at other  times, took a complete vacation. He even forgot hunger, and the  whistlers and gophers were quite safe. He was tireless. He rambled  during the night as well as the day in quest of his lady-love.
  It was quite natural that in these exciting hours he should forget  Muskwa almost entirely. At least ten times before sunset he crossed and  recrossed the creek, and the disgusted and almost ready-to-quit cub  waded and swam and floundered after him until he was nearly drowned.  The tenth or dozenth time Thor forded the stream Muskwa revolted and  followed along on his own side. It was not long before the grizzly  returned.
  It was soon after this, just as the sun was setting, that the  unexpected happened. What little wind there was suddenly swung straight  into the east, and from the western slopes half a mile away it brought  a scent that held Thor motionless in his tracks for perhaps half a  minute, and then set him off on that ambling run which is the  ungainliest gait of all four-footed creatures.
  Muskwa rolled after him like a ball, pegging away for dear life, but  losing ground at every jump. In that half-mile stretch he would have  lost Thor altogether if the grizzly had not stopped near the bottom of  the first slope to take fresh reckonings. When he started up the slope  Muskwa could see him, and with a yelping cry for him to wait a minute  set after him again.
  Two or three hundred yards up the mountainside the slope shelved  downward into a hollow, or dip, and nosing about in this dip, questing  the air as Thor had quested it, was the beautiful she-grizzly from over  the range. With her was one of her last year's cubs. Thor was within  fifty yards of her when he came over the crest. He stopped. He looked  at her. And Iskwao, &#8220;the female,&#8221; looked at him.
  Then followed true bear courtship. All haste, all eagerness, all  desire for his mate seemed to have left Thor; and if Iskwao had been  eager and yearning she was profoundly indifferent now. For two or three  minutes Thor stood looking casually about, and this gave Muskwa time to  come up and perch himself beside him, expecting another fight.
  As though Thor was a thousand miles or so from her thoughts, Iskwao  turned over a flat rock and began hunting for grubs and ants, and not  to be outdone in this stoic unconcern Thor pulled up a bunch of grass  and swallowed it. Iskwao moved a step or two, and Thor moved a step or  two, and as if purely by accident their steps were toward each other.
  Muskwa was puzzled. The older cub was puzzled. They sat on their  haunches like two dogs, one three times as big as the other, and  wondered what was going to happen.
  It took Thor and Iskwao five minutes to arrive within five feet of  each other, and then very decorously they smelled noses.
  The year-old cub joined the family circle. He was of just the right  age to have an exceedingly long name, for the Indians called him  Pipoonaskoos&#8212; &#8220;the yearling.&#8221; He came boldly up to Thor and his  mother. For a moment Thor did not seem to notice him. Then his long  right arm shot out in a sudden swinging upper-cut that lifted  Pipoonaskoos clean off the ground and sent him spinning two-thirds of  the distance up to Muskwa.
  The mother paid no attention to this elimination of her offspring,  and still lovingly smelled noses with Thor. Muskwa, however, thought  this was the preliminary of another tremendous fight, and with a yelp  of defiance he darted down the slope and set upon Pipoonaskoos with all  his might.
  Pipoonaskoos was &#8220;mother's boy.&#8221; That is, he was one of those cubs  who persist in following their mothers through a second season, instead  of striking out for themselves. He had nursed until he was five months  old; his parent had continued to hunt tidbits for him; he was fat, and  sleek, and soft; he was, in fact, a &#8220;Willie&#8221; of the mountains.
  On the other hand, a few days had put a lot of real mettle into  Muskwa, and though he was only a third as large as Pipoonaskoos, and  his feet were sore, and his back ached, he landed on the other cub like  a shot out of a gun.
  Still dazed by the blow of Thor's paw, Pipoonaskoos gave a yelping  call to his mother for help at this sudden onslaught. He had never been  in a fight, and he rolled over on his back and side, kicking and  scratching and yelping as Muskwa's needle-like teeth sank again and  again into his tender hide.
  Luckily Muskwa got him once by the nose, and bit deep, and if there  was any sand at all in Willie Pipoonaskoos this took it out of him, and  while Muskwa held on for dear life he let out a steady stream of yelps,  informing his mother that he was being murdered. To these cries Iskwao  paid no attention at all, but continued to smell noses with Thor.
  Finally freeing his bleeding nose, Pipoonaskoos shook Muskwa off by  sheer force of superior weight and took to flight on a dead run. Muskwa  pegged valiantly after him. Twice they made the circle of the basin,  and in spite of his shorter legs, Muskwa was a close second in the race  when Pipoonaskoos, turning an affrighted glance sidewise for an  instant, hit against a rock and went sprawling. In another moment  Muskwa was at him again, and he would have continued biting and  snarling until there was no more strength left in him had he not  happened to see Thor and Iskwao disappearing slowly over the edge of  the slope toward the valley.
  Almost immediately Muskwa forgot fighting. He was amazed to find  that Thor, instead of tearing up the other bear, was walking off with  her. Pipoonaskoos also pulled himself together and looked. Then Muskwa  looked at Pipoonaskoos, and Pipoonaskoos looked at Muskwa. The  tan-faced cub licked his chops just once, as if torn between the  prospective delight of mauling Pipoonaskoos and the more imperative  duty of following Thor. The other gave him no choice. With a whimpering  yelp he set off after his mother.
  Exciting times followed for the two cubs. All that night Thor and  Iskwao kept by themselves in the buffalo willow thickets and the  balsams of the creek-bottom. Early in the evening Pipoonaskoos sneaked  up to his mother again, and Thor lifted him into the middle of the  creek. The second visual proof of Thor's displeasure impinged upon  Muskwa the fact that the older bears were not in a mood to tolerate the  companionship of cubs, and the result was a wary and suspicious truce  between him and Pipoonaskoos.
  All the next day Thor and Iskwao kept to themselves. Early in the  morning Muskwa began adventuring about a little in quest of food. He  liked tender grass, but it was not very filling. Several times he saw  Pipoonaskoos digging in the soft bottom close to the creek, and finally  he drove the other cub away from a partly digged hole and investigated  for himself. After a little more excavating he pulled out a white,  bulbous, tender root that he thought was the sweetest and nicest thing  he had ever eaten, not even excepting fish. It was the one<I> bonne  bouche</I> of all the good things he would eventually learn to eat&#8212;the  spring beauty. One other thing alone was at all comparable with it, and  that was the dog-tooth violet. Spring beauties were growing about him  abundantly, and he continued to dig until his feet were grievously  tender. But he had the satisfaction of being comfortably fed.
  Thor was again responsible for a fight between Muskwa and  Pipoonaskoos. Late in the afternoon the older bears were lying down  side by side in a thicket when, without any apparent reason at all,  Thor opened his huge jaws and emitted a low, steady, growling roar that  sounded very much like the sound he had made when tearing the life out  of the big black. Iskwao raised her head and joined him in the tumult,  both of them perfectly good-natured and quite happy during the  operation. Why mating bears indulge in this blood-curdling duet is a  mystery which only the bears themselves can explain. It lasts for about  a minute, and during this particular minute Muskwa, who lay outside the  thicket, thought that surely the glorious hour had come when Thor was  beating up the parent of Pipoonaskoos. And instantly he looked for  Pipoonaskoos.
  Unfortunately the Willie-bear came sneaking round the edge of the  brush just then, and Muskwa gave him no chance to ask questions. He  shot at him in a black streak and Pipoonaskoos bowled over like a fat  baby. For several minutes they bit and dug and clawed, most of the  biting and digging and clawing being done by Muskwa, while Pipoonaskoos  devoted his time and energy to yelping.
  Finally the larger cub got away and again took to flight. Muskwa  pursued him, into the brush and out, down to the creek and back,  halfway up the slope and down again, until he was so tired he had to  drop on his belly for a rest.
  At this juncture Thor emerged from the thicket. He was alone. For  the first time since last night he seemed to notice Muskwa. Then he  sniffed the wind up the valley and down the valley, and after that  turned and walked straight toward the distant slopes down which they  had come the preceding afternoon. Muskwa was both pleased and  perplexed. He wanted to go into the thicket and snarl and pull at the  hide of the dead bear that must be in there, and he also wanted to  finish Pipoonaskoos. After a moment or two of hesitation he ran after  Thor and again followed close at his heels.
  After a little Iskwao came from the thicket and nosed the wind as  Thor had felt it. Then she turned in the opposite direction, and with  Pipoonaskoos close behind her, went up the slope and continued slowly  and steadily in the face of the setting sun.
  So ended Thor's love-making and Muskwa's first fighting; and  together they trailed eastward again, to face the most terrible peril  that had ever come into the mountains for four-footed beast-a peril  that was merciless, a peril from which there was no escape, a peril  that was fraught with death.
