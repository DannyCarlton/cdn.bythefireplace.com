  The first of September came, and with it came the opening of the  fall schools. On the first day, when Andy, at work in the yard, saw the  boys and the girls go by with their books, he felt a longing to go,  too. He knew very well that his education had been very much neglected,  and that he knew less of books than a boy of his age ought to do.
  &#8220;I wish I could go to school this term,&#8221; he said to himself; &#8220;but  it's no use wishin'. Mother needs my wages, and I must keep on  workin'.&#8221;
  The same thought had come to the Misses Grant. Andy had been in  their employ now for six weeks, and by his unfailing good humor and  readiness to oblige, had won their favor. They felt interested in his  progress, and, at the same moment that the thought referred to passed  though Andy's mind, Miss Priscilla said to her sister:
  &#8220;The fall school begins to-day. There's Godfrey Preston just passed  with some books under his arm.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose Andrew would like to be going to school with other boys  of his age.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't you think we could spare him to go half the day?&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Sophia, with alacrity.
  &#8220;There isn't so much work to do now as there was in the summer, and  he could do his chores early in the morning. He could go to school in  the forenoon and work in the afternoon.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so, Priscilla. Shall we give him less wages?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, I think not. He needs the money to give his mother.&#8221;
  &#8220;Call him in and tell him,&#8221; suggested Sophia.
  &#8220;It will do at dinner time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so.&#8221;
  When the dinner was over, and Andy rose from the table, Miss  Priscilla introduced the subject.
  &#8220;Are you a good scholar, Andrew?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm a mighty poor one, ma'am.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you ever study much?&#8221;
  &#8220;No, ma'am, I've had to work ever since I was so high,&#8221; indicating a  point about two feet from the ground.
  &#8220;Dear me,&#8221; said Sophia, &#8220;you must have been very small.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, ma'am, I was very small of my size.&#8221;
  &#8220;I've been thinking, Andrew, that perhaps we could spare you half  the day, so that you could go to school in the forenoon&#8212;you could  learn something in three hours&#8212;should you like it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Would I like it, ma'am? Wouldn't I, though? I don't want to grow up  a poor, ignorant crathur, hardly able to read and write.&#8221;
  &#8220;Then you can go to school to-morrow, and ask the teacher if he will  take you for half the day. You can get up early, and get your chores  done before school.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, yes, ma'am, I can do that easy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I think we have some schoolbooks in the house. Some years ago we  had a nephew stay with us, and go to school. I think his books are  still in the closet.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, ma'am. It'll save me buyin', and I haven't got any money  to spare.&#8221;
  &#8220;We shall give you the same wages, Andrew, though you will work  less.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, ma'am. You're very kind.&#8221;
  &#8220;Try to improve your time in school, as becomes the great-grandson  of such a distinguished orator.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll try, ma'am,&#8221; said Andy, looking a little queer at this  allusion to the great Edmund Burke. In fact, he was ashamed of having  deceived the kind old ladies, but didn't like now to own up to the  deception lest they should lose confidence in him. But he determined  hereafter to speak the truth, and not resort to deception.
  The next morning, at twenty minutes of nine, Andy left the house  provided with books, and joyfully took his way to the schoolhouse,  which was a quarter of a mile distant. As he ascended the small hill on  which it stood, he attracted the attention of a group of boys who had  already arrived. Among them was his old adversary, Godfrey Preston.
  &#8220;Is that Irish boy coming to school?&#8221; he said in a tone of disgust.
  &#8220;What? Andy Burke? I hope so,&#8221; said Charles Fleming, &#8220;he's a good  fellow.&#8221;
  &#8220;He's only an Irish boy,&#8221; said Godfrey, with a sneer.
  &#8220;And I am only an American boy,&#8221; said Charles, good-humoredly.
  &#8220;You can associate with him if you want to; I shan't,&#8221; said Godfrey.
  &#8220;That's where I agree with you, Godfrey,&#8221; said Ben Travers, who made  himself rather a toady of Godfrey's.
  Andy had now come up, so that Charles Fleming did not reply, but  called out, cordially:
  &#8220;Are you coming to school, Andy?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Andy.
  &#8220;I'm glad of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;What's the matter with them fellows,&#8221; as  Godfrey and Bill Travers walked off haughtily, tossing their heads.
  Charles Fleming laughed.
  &#8220;They don't think we are good enough for their company,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I'm not anxious for it,&#8221; said Andy. &#8220;I like yours better.&#8221;
  &#8220;I didn't think you could get away from work to come to school. Are  you working for Miss Grant now?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, but she lets me come to school half the day. She's a bully  ould lady.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, half a loaf's better than no bread. Will you sit with me?  I've got no one at my desk. Say yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's just what I'd like, Charlie, but maybe Godfrey Preston wants  to sit with me. I wouldn't like to disappoint him,&#8221; said Andy, with sly  humor.
  &#8220;Sit with me till he invites you, then.&#8221;
  &#8220;That'll be a long day.&#8221;
  They went into the schoolhouse, and Andy deposited his books in the  desk next to Charlie Fleming's. He couldn't have wished for a better or  more agreeable companion. Charlie was the son of Dr. Fleming, the  village physician, and was a general favorite in the town on account of  his sunny, attractive manner. But, with all his affability, he was  independent and resolute, if need be. He was one of the leaders of the  school. Godfrey aspired also to be a leader, and was to some extent on  account of his father's wealth and high standing, for, as we have seen,  Colonel Preston was not like his son. Still, it is doubtful whether  anyone was much attached to Godfrey. He was too selfish in disposition,  and offensively consequential in manner, to inspire devoted friendship.  Ben Travers, however, flattered him, and followed him about, simply  because he was the son of a rich man. Such cases occur sometimes among  American schoolboys, but generally they are too democratic and sensible  to attach importance to social distinctions in the schoolroom, or in  the playground.
  When the teacher&#8212;a certain Ebenezer Stone, a man of thirty or  upward&#8212;entered, Andy went up to him and asked permission to attend  school a part of the time. As there had been such cases in former  terms, no objection was offered by the teacher, and Andy went back to  his seat, a regularly admitted member of the school.
  It was found necessary to put him in a low class to begin with. He  was naturally bright, but, as we know, his opportunities of learning  had been very limited, and he could not be expected to know much. But  Andy was old enough now to understand the worth of knowledge, and he  devoted himself so earnestly to study that in the course of three weeks  he was promoted to a higher class. This, however, is anticipating.
  When recess came, the scholars poured out upon the playround.  Charles Fleming and Godfrey Preston happened to pass out side by side.
  &#8220;I see you've taken that Irish boy to sit with you,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;You mean Andy Burke? Yes, I invited him to be my desk-fellow.&#8221;
  &#8220;I congratulate you on your high-toned and aristocratic associate,&#8221;  observed Godfrey, sarcastically.
  &#8220;Thank you. I am glad to have him with me.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wouldn't condescend to take him into my seat.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nor do I. There isn't any condescension about it.&#8221;
  &#8220;He works for a living.&#8221;
  &#8220;So does my father, and so does yours. Are you going to cut your  father's acquaintance for that reason?&#8221;
  &#8220;My father could live without work.&#8221;
  &#8220;He doesn't choose to, and that's where he shows his good sense.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's a different kind of work from sawing and splitting wood, and  such low labor.&#8221;
  &#8220;It strikes me, Godfrey, that you ought to have been born somewhere  else than in America. In this country labor is considered honorable.  You ought to be living under a monarchy.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't believe in associating with inferiors.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't look upon Andy Burke as my inferior,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;He is  poor, to be sure, but he is a good fellow, and helps support his mother  and sister, as I would do in his place.&#8221;
  &#8220;Charlie Fleming,&#8221; was heard from the playground, &#8220;come and choose  up for baseball.&#8221;
  Without waiting for an answer, Charlie ran to the field alongside  the schoolhouse, where the game was to take place.
