  Mr. Bickford also seemed a little surprised at Joe's coolness.  Though not a coward in the face of danger, he had been somewhat  impressed by the fierce aspect of the man from Pike County, and really  looked upon him as a reckless daredevil who was afraid of nothing. Joe  judged him more truly. He decided that a man who boasted so loudly was  a sham. If he had talked less, he would have feared him more.
  After his last bloodthirsty declaration the man from Pike County  temporarily subsided.
  He drew out from his pocket a greasy pack of cards, and after  skilfully shuffling them inquired:
  &#8220;What do you say, strangers, to a little game to pass away the  time?&#8221;
  &#8220;I never played keards in my life,&#8221; said Joshua Bickford.
  &#8220;Where was you raised?&#8221; demanded the Pike man contemptuously.
  &#8220;Pumpkin Hollow, State o' Maine,&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;Dad's an orthodox  deacon. He never let any of us play keards. I don't know one from  t'other.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll learn you,&#8221; said the Pike man condescendingly. &#8220;Suppose we  have a game of poker?&#8221;
  &#8220;Ain't that a gambling' game?&#8221; inquired Joshua.
  &#8220;We always play for something,&#8221; said the Pike man. &#8220;It's dern  foolishness playin' for nothing. Shall we have a game?&#8221;
  He looked at Joe as he spoke.
  &#8220;I don't care to play,&#8221; said our hero. &#8220;I don't know much about  cards, and I don't want to play for money.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's dern foolishness,&#8221; said the stranger, whose object it was to  clean out his new friends, being an expert gambler.
  &#8220;Perhaps it is,&#8221; said Joe, &#8220;but I only speak for myself. Mr.  Bickford may feel differently.&#8221;
  &#8220;Will you take a hand, Bickford?&#8221; asked the Pike man, thinking it  possible that Joshua might have some money of which he could relieve  him.
  &#8220;You kin show me how to play if you want to,&#8221; said Joshua, &#8220;but I  won't gamble any.&#8221;
  The Pike man put up his pack of cards in disgust.
  &#8220;Derned if I ever met sich fellers!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You're Methodists,  ain't you?&#8221;
  &#8220;We generally decline doing what we don't want to do,&#8221; said Joe.
  &#8220;Look here, boy,&#8221; blustered the Pike man, &#8220;I reckon you don't know  me. I'm from Pike County, Missouri, I am. I'm a rip-tail roarer, I am.  I kin whip my weight in wildcats.&#8221;
  &#8220;You told us that afore,&#8221; said Joshua placidly.
  &#8220;Derned if I don't mean it, too!&#8221; exclaimed the Pike County man,  with a fierce frown. &#8220;Do you know how I served a man last week?&#8221;
  &#8220;No. Tell us, won't you?&#8221; said Joshua.
  &#8220;We was ridin' together over in Alameda County. We'd met  permiscuous, like we've met to-day. I was tellin' him how four b'ars  attacked me once, and I fit 'em all single-handed, when he laughed, and  said he reckoned I'd been drinkin' and saw double. If he'd knowed me  better, he wouldn't have done it.&#8221;
  &#8220;What did you do?&#8221; asked Joshua, interested.
  Joe, who was satisfied that the fellow was romancing, did not  exhibit any interest.
  &#8220;What did I do?&#8221; echoed the Pike County man fiercely. &#8220;I told him he  didn't know the man he insulted. I told him I was from Pike County,  Missouri, and that I was a rip-tail roarer.&#8221;
  &#8220;And could whip your weight in wildcats,&#8221; suggested Joe.
  The Pike man appeared irritated.
  &#8220;Don't interrupt me, boy,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It ain't healthy.&#8221;
  &#8220;After you'd made them remarks what did you do?&#8221; inquired Joshua.
  &#8220;I told him he'd insulted me and must fight. I always do that.&#8221;
  &#8220;Did he fight?&#8221;
  &#8220;He had to.&#8221;
  &#8220;How did it come out?&#8221;
  &#8220;I shot him through the heart,&#8221; said the man from Pike County  fiercely. &#8220;His bones are bleaching in the valley where he fell.&#8221;
  &#8220;Sho!&#8221; said Joshua.
  The Pike County man looked from one to the other to see what effect  had been produced by his blood-curdling narration. Joshua looked rather  perplexed, as if he didn't quite know what to think, but Joe seemed  tranquil.
  &#8220;I think you said it happened last week,&#8221; said Joe.
  &#8220;If I said so, it is so,&#8221; said the Pike man, who in truth did not  remember what time he had mentioned.
  &#8220;I don't question that. I was only wondering how his bones could  begin to bleach so soon after he was killed.&#8221;
  &#8220;Just so,&#8221; said Joshua, to whom this difficulty had not presented  itself before.
  &#8220;Do you doubt my word, stranger?&#8221; exclaimed the Pike man, putting  his hand to his side and fingering his knife.
  &#8220;Not at all,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;But I wanted to understand how it was.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't give no explanations,&#8221; said the Pike man haughtily, &#8220;and I  allow no man to doubt my word.&#8221;
  &#8220;Look here, my friend,&#8221; said Joshua, &#8220;ain't you rather  cantankerous?&#8221;
  &#8220;What's that?&#8221; demanded the other suspiciously.
  &#8220;No offense,&#8221; said Joshua, &#8220;but you take a feller up so we don't  know exactly how to talk to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I take no insults,&#8221; said the Pike man. &#8220;Insults must be washed out  in blood.&#8221;
  &#8220;Soap-suds is better than blood for washin' purposes,&#8221; said Joshua  practically. &#8220;Seems to me you're spoilin' for a fight all the time.&#8221;
  &#8220;I allow I am,&#8221; said the Pike man, who regarded this as a  compliment. &#8220;I was brought up on fightin'. When I was a boy I could  whip any boy in school.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's why they called you a rip-tail roarer, I guess,&#8221; said  Joshua.
  &#8220;You're right, stranger,&#8221; said the Pike man complacently.
  &#8220;What did you do when the teacher give you a lickin'?&#8221; asked Mr.  Bickford.
  &#8220;What did I do?&#8221; yelled the Pike County man, with a demoniac frown.
  &#8220;Exactly so.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shot him!&#8221; said the Pike man briefly.
  &#8220;Sho! How many teachers did you shoot when you was a boy?&#8221;
  &#8220;Only one. The rest heard of it and never dared touch me.&#8221;
  &#8220;So you could play hookey and cut up all you wanted to?&#8221;
  &#8220;You're right, stranger.&#8221;
  &#8220;They didn't manage that way at Pumpkin Hollow,&#8221; said Mr. Bickford.  &#8220;Boys ain't quite so handy with shootin'-irons. When the master flogged  us we had to stand it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Were you afraid of him?&#8221; asked the Pike man disdainfully.
  &#8220;Well, I was,&#8221; Joshua admitted. &#8220;He was a big man with arms just  like flails, and the way he used to pound us was a caution.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'd have shot him in his tracks,&#8221; said the Pike man fiercely.
  &#8220;You'd have got a wallopin' fust, I reckon,&#8221; said Joshua.
  &#8220;Do you mean to insult me?&#8221; demanded the Pike man.
  &#8220;Oh, lay down, and don't be so cantankerous,&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;You're  allus thinkin' of bein' insulted.&#8221;
  &#8220;We may as well be going,&#8221; said Joe, who was thoroughly disgusted  with their new companion.
  &#8220;Just as you say, Joe,&#8221; said Joshua. &#8220;Here, you pesky critter, come  and let me mount you.&#8221;
  The mustang realized Joe's prediction. After his hearty supper he  seemed to be quite tractable and permitted Mr. Bickford to mount him  without opposition.
  Joe also mounted his horse.
  &#8220;I'll ride along with you if you've no objections,&#8221; said the Pike  man. &#8220;We kin camp together to-night.&#8221;
  So saying, he too mounted the sorry-looking steed which he had  recently dismounted.
  Joe was not hypocrite enough to say that he was welcome. He thought  it best to be candid.
  &#8220;If you are quite convinced that neither of us wishes to insult  you,&#8221; he said quietly, &#8220;you can join us. If you are bent on quarreling,  you had better ride on by yourself.&#8221;
  The Pike man frowned fiercely.
  &#8220;Boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I have shot a man for less than that.&#8221;
  &#8220;I carry a revolver,&#8221; said Joe quietly, &#8220;but I shan't use it unless  it is necessary. If you are so easily offended, you'd better ride on  alone.&#8221;
  This the Pike man did not care to do.
  &#8220;You're a strange boy,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I reckon you're on the square.  I'll go along with you.&#8221;
  &#8220;I would rather you'd leave us,&#8221; thought Joe, but he merely said:  &#8220;Very well.&#8221;
