  All that spring and summer Jan spent in the thick caribou swamps  and  low ridge-mountains along the Barrens. It was two months before he   appeared at the post again, and then he remained only long enough to   patch himself up and secure fresh supplies. 
  M&eacute;lisse had suffered quietly during these two months, a grief and   loneliness filling her heart which none knew but herself. Even from   Iowaka she kept her unhappiness a secret; and yet when the gloom had   settled heaviest upon her, she was still buoyed up by a persistent   hope. Until Jan's last visit to Lac Bain this hope never quite went   out. 
  The first evening after his arrival from the swamps to the west, he   came to the cabin. His beard had grown again. His hair was long and   shaggy, and fell in shining dishevelment upon his shoulders. The   sensitive beauty of his great eyes, once responsive to every passing   humor in M&eacute;lisse, flashing fun at her laughter, glowing softly in   their devotion, was gone. His face was filled with the age-old silence   of the forest man. Firmly and yet gently, it repelled whatever of the   old things she might have said and done, holding her away from him as   if by power of a strong hand. 
  This time M&eacute;lisse knew that there was left not even the last   comforting spark of hope within her bosom. Jan had gone out of her   life for ever, leaving to her, as a haunting ghost of what they two   had once been to each other, the old violin on the cabin wall. 
  After he went away again, the violin became more and more to her  what  it had once been to him. She played it as he had played it,  sobbing  her loneliness and her heart-break through its strings, in  lone hours  clasping it to her breast and speaking to it as Jan had  talked to it  in years gone by. 
  &quot;If you could only tell me&#8212;if you only could!&quot; she whispered to it   one day, when the autumn was drawing near. &quot;If you could tell me about   him, and what I might do&#8212;dear old violin!&quot; 
  Once during the autumn Jan came in for supplies and traps, and his   dogs and sledge. He was planning to spend the winter two hundred miles   to the west, in the country of the Athabasca. He was at Lac Bain for a   week, and during this time a mail-runner came in from Fort Churchill. 
  The runner brought a new experience into the life of M&eacute;lisse&#8212;her   first letter. It was from young Dixon&#8212;twenty or more closely written   pages of it, in which he informed her that he was going to spend a   part of the approaching winter at Lac Bain. 
  She was reading the last page when Jan came into the cabin. Her  cheeks  were slightly flushed by this new excitement, which was  reflected in  her eyes as she looked at Jan. 
  &quot;A letter!&quot; she cried, holding out her two hands filled with the   pages. &quot;A letter&#8212;to me, Jan, all the way from Fort Churchill!&quot; 
  &quot;Who in the world&#8212;&quot; he began, smiling at her; and stopped. 
  &quot;It's from Mr. Dixon,&quot; she said, the flush deepening in her cheeks.   &quot;He's going to spend part of the winter with us.&quot; 
  &quot;I'm glad of that, M&eacute;lisse,&quot; said Jan quietly. &quot;I like him, and  would  like to know him better. I hope he will bring you some more  books&#8212;and  strings.&quot; He glanced at the old violin. &quot;Do you play much?&quot; 
  &quot;A great deal,&quot; she replied. &quot;Won't you play for me, Jan?&quot; 
  &quot;My hands are too rough; and besides, I've forgotten all that I  ever  knew.&quot; 
  &quot;Even the things you played when I was a baby?&quot; 
  &quot;I think I have, M&eacute;lisse. But you must never forget them.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall remember them&#8212;always,&quot; she answered softly. &quot;Some day it  may  be that I will teach them to you again.&quot; 
  He did not see her again until six months later, when he came in to   the caribou roast, with his furs. Then he learned that another letter   had come to M&eacute;lisse, and that Dixon had gone to London instead of   coming to Lac Bain. 
  The day after the carnival he went back into the country of the   Athabasca. Spring did not see him at Lac Bain. Early summer brought no   news of him. In the floods, Jean went by the water-way to the   Athabasca, and found Thoreau's cabin abandoned. There had not been   life in it for a long time. The Indians said that since the melting   snows they had not seen Jan. A half-breed whom Jean met at Fond du Lac   said that he had found the bones of a white man on the Beaver, with a   Hudson's Bay gun and a horn-handled knife beside them. 
  Jean came back to Lac Bain heavy at heart. 
  &quot;There is no doubt but that he is dead,&quot; he told Iowaka. &quot;I do not   believe that it will hurt very much if you tell M&eacute;lisse.&quot; 
  One day early in September a lone figure came in to the post at  noon,  when the company people were at dinner. He carried a pack, and  six  dogs trailed at his heels. It was Jan Thoreau. 
  &quot;I have been down to civilization,&quot; was his explanation. &quot;I have   returned to spend this winter at Lac Bain.&quot;
