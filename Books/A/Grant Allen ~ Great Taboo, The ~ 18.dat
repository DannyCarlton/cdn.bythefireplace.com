Muriel, meanwhile, sat alone in her hut, frightened at Felix's unexpected  disappearance so early in the morning, and anxiously awaiting her lover's  return, for she made no pretences now to herself that she did not really  love Felix. Though the two might never return to Europe to be husband and  wife, she did not doubt that before the eye of Heaven they were already  betrothed to one another as truly as though they had plighted their troth  in solemn fashion. Felix had risked his life for her, and had brought all  this misery upon himself in the attempt to save her. Felix was now all  the world that was left her. With Felix, she was happy, even on this  horrible island; without him, she was miserable and terrified, no matter  what happened.    
"Mali," she cried to her faithful attendant, as soon as she found Felix  was missing from his tent, "what's become of Mr. Thurstan? Where can he  be gone, I wonder, this morning?"    
"You no fear, Missy Queenie," Mali answered, with the childish  confidence of the native Polynesian. "Mistah Thurstan, him gone to see  man-a-oui-oui, the King of the Birds. Month of Birds finish last night;  man-a-oui-oui no taboo any longer. King of the Birds keep very old  parrot, Boupari folk tell me; and old parrot very wise, know how to make  Tu-Kila-Kila. Mistah Thurstan, him gone to find man-a-oui-oui. Parrot  tell him plenty wise thing. Parrot wiser than Boupari people; know very  good medicine; wise like Queensland lady and gentleman." And Mali set  herself vigorously to work to wash the wooden platter on which she served  up her mistress's yam for breakfast.    
It was curious to Muriel to see how readily Mali had slipped from  savagery to civilization in Queensland, and how easily she had slipped  back again from civilization to savagery in Boupari. In waiting on her  mistress she was just the ordinary trained native Australian servant; in  every other respect she was the simple unadulterated heathen Polynesian.  She recognized in Muriel a white lady of the English sort, and treated  her within the hut as white ladies were invariably treated in Queensland;  but she considered that at Boupari one must do as Boupari does, and it  never for a moment occurred to her simple mind to doubt the omnipotence  of Tu-Kila-Kila in his island realm any more than she had doubted the  omnipotence of the white man and his local religion in their proper place  (as she thought it) in Queensland.    
An hour or two passed before Felix returned. At last he arrived, very  white and pale, and Muriel saw at once by the mere look on his face that  he had learned some terrible news at the Frenchman's.    
"Well, you found him?" she cried, taking his hand in hers, but hardly  daring to ask the fatal question at once.    
And Felix, sitting down, as pale as a ghost, answered faintly, "Yes,  Muriel, I found him!"    
"And he told you everything?"    
"Everything he knew, my poor child. Oh, Muriel, Muriel, don't ask me what  it is. It's too terrible to tell you."    
Muriel clasped her white hands together, held bloodless downward, and  looked at him fixedly. "Mali, you can go," she said. And the Shadow,  rising up with childish confidence, glided from the hut, and left them,  for the first time since their arrival on the central island, alone  together.    
Muriel looked at him once more with the same deadly fixed look. "With  you, Felix," she said, slowly, "I can bear or dare anything. I feel as if  the bitterness of death were past long ago. I know it must come. I only  want to be quite sure when.... And besides, you must remember, I have  your promise."    
Felix clasped his own hands despondently in return, and gazed across at  her from his seat a few feet off in unspeakable misery.    
"Muriel," he cried, "I couldn't. I haven't the heart. I daren't."    
Muriel rose and laid her hand solemnly on his arm. "You will!" she  answered, boldly. "You can! You must! I know I can trust your promise for  that. This moment, if you like. I would not shrink. But you will never  let me fall alive into the hands of those wretches. Felix, from <i>your</i>  hand I could stand anything. I'm not afraid to die. I love you too  dearly."    
Felix held her white little wrist in his grasp and sobbed like a child.  Her very bravery and confidence seemed to unman him, utterly.    
She looked at him once more. "When?" she asked, quietly, but with lips as  pale as death.    
"In about four months from now," Felix answered, endeavoring to be calm.    
"And they will kill us both?"    
"Yes, both. I think so."    
"Together?"    
"Together."    
Muriel drew a deep sigh.    
"Will you know the day beforehand?" she asked.    
"Yes. The Frenchman told me it. He has known others killed in the  self-same fashion."    
"Then, Felix---the night before it comes, you will promise me, will you?"    
"Muriel, Muriel, I could never dare to kill you."    
She laid her hand soothingly on his. She stroked him gently. "You are  a man," she said, looking up into his eyes with confidence. "I trust  you. I believe in you. I know you will never let these savages hurt  me.... Felix, in spite of everything, I've been happier since we came to  this island together than ever I have been in my life before. I've had my  wish. I didn't want to miss in life the one thing that life has best  worth giving. I haven't missed it now. I know I haven't; for I love you,  and you love me. After that, I can die, and die gladly. If I die with  <i>you</i>, that's all I ask. These seven or eight terrible weeks have made me  feel somehow unnaturally calm. When I came here first I lived all the  time in an agony of terror. I've got over the agony of terror now. I'm  quite resigned and happy. All I ask is to be saved--by you--from the  cruel hands of these hateful cannibals."    
Felix raised her white hand just once to his lips. It was the first time  he had ever ventured to kiss her. He kissed it fervently. She let it drop  as if dead by her side.    
"Now tell me all that happened," she said. "I'm strong enough to bear it.  I feel such a woman now--so wise and calm. These few weeks have made me  grow from a girl into a woman all at once. There's nothing I daren't  hear, if you'll tell me it, Felix."    
Felix took up her hand again and held it in his, as he narrated the whole  story of his visit to the Frenchman. When Muriel had heard it, she said  once more, slowly, "I don't think there's any hope in all these wild  plans of playing off superstition against superstition. To my mind there  are only two chances left for us now. One is to concoct with the  Frenchman some means of getting away by canoe from the island--I'd rather  trust the sea than the tender mercy of these dreadful people; the other  is to keep a closer lookout than ever for the merest chance of a passing  steamer."    
Felix drew a deep sigh. "I'm afraid neither's much use," he said. "If we  tried to get away, dogged as we are, day and night, by our Shadows, the  natives would follow us with their war-canoes in battle array and hack us  to pieces; for Peyron says that, regarding us as gods, they think the  rain would vanish from their island forever if once they allowed us to  get away alive and carry the luck with us. And as to the steamers, we  haven't seen a trace of one since we left the Australasian. Probably it  was only by the purest accident that even she ever came so close in to  Boupari."    
"At any rate," Muriel cried, still clasping his hand tight, and letting  the tears now trickle slowly down her pale white cheeks, "we can talk it  all over some day with M. Peyron."    
"We can talk it over to-day," Felix answered, "if it comes to that; for  Peyron means to step round, he says, a little later in the afternoon, to  pay his respects to the first white lady he has ever seen since he left  New Caledonia."
