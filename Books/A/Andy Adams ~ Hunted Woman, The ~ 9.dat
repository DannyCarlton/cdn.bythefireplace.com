  Stevens, dreaming of twenty horses plunging to death among the rocks  in the river, slept uneasily. He awoke before it was dawn, but when he  dragged himself from his tepee, moving quietly not to awaken his boy,  he found John Aldous on his knees before a small fire, slicing thin  rashers of bacon into a frying-pan. The weight of his loss was in the  tired packer's eyes and face and the listless droop of his shoulders.  John Aldous, with three hours between the blankets to his credit, was  as cheery as the crackling fire itself. He had wanted to whistle for  the last half-hour. Seeing Stevens, he began now.
  &#8220;I wasn't going to rouse you until breakfast was ready,&#8221; he  interrupted himself to say. &#8220;I heard you groaning, Stevens. I know you  had a bad night. And the kid, too. He couldn't sleep. But I made up my  mind you'd have to get up early. I've got a lot of business on to-day,  and we'll have to rouse Curly Roper out of bed to buy his pack outfit.  Find the coffee, will you? I couldn't.&#8221;
  For a moment Stevens stood over him.
  &#8220;See here, Aldous, you didn't mean what you said last night, did  you? You didn't mean&#8212;that?&#8221;
  &#8220;Confound it, yes! Can't you understand plain English, Stevens?  Don't you believe a man when he's a gentleman? Buy that outfit! Why,  I'd buy twenty outfits to-day, I'm&#8212;I'm feeling so fine, Stevens!&#8221;
  For the first time in forty-eight hours Stevens smiled.
  &#8220;I was wondering if I hadn't been dreaming,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Once, a long  time ago, I guess I felt just like you do now.&#8221;
  With which cryptic remark he went for the coffee.
  Aldous looked up in time to see the boy stagger sleepily out of the  tepee. There was something pathetic about the motherlessness of the  picture, and he understood a little of what Stevens had meant.
  An hour later, with breakfast over, they started for Curly's. Curly  was pulling on his boots when they arrived, while his wife was frying  the inevitable bacon in the kitchen.
  &#8220;I hear you have some horses for sale, Curly,&#8221; said Aldous.
  &#8220;Hi 'ave.&#8221;
  &#8220;How many?&#8221;
  &#8220;Twenty-nine, 'r twenty-eight&#8212;mebby twenty-seven.&#8221;
  &#8220;How much?&#8221;
  Curly looked up from the task of pulling on his second boot.
  &#8220;H'are you buying 'orses or looking for hinformation?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;I'm buying, and I'm in a hurry. How much do you want a head?&#8221;
  &#8220;Sixty, 'r six&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll give you sixty dollars apiece for twenty-eight head, and  that's just ten dollars apiece more than they're worth,&#8221; broke in  Aldous, pulling a check-book and a fountain pen from his pocket. &#8220;Is it  a go?&#8221;
  A little stupefied by the suddenness of it all, Curly opened his  mouth and stared.
  &#8220;Is it a go?&#8221; repeated Aldous. &#8220;Including blankets, saddles,  pack-saddles, ropes, and canvases?&#8221;
  Curly nodded, looking from Aldous to Stevens to see if he could  detect anything that looked like a joke.
  &#8220;Hit's a go,&#8221; he said.
  Aldous handed him a check for sixteen hundred and eighty dollars.
  &#8220;Make out the bill of sale to Stevens,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'm paying for  them, but they're Stevens' horses. And, look here, Curly, I'm buying  them only with your agreement that you'll say nothing about who paid  for them. Will you agree to that?&#8221;
  Curly was joyously looking at the check.
  &#8220;Gyve me a Bible,&#8221; he demanded. &#8220;Hi'll swear Stevens p'id for them!  I give you the word of a Hinglish gentleman!&#8221;
  Without another word Aldous opened the cabin door and was gone,  leaving Stevens quite as much amazed as the little Englishman whom  everybody called Curly, because he had no hair.
  Aldous went at once to the station, and for the first time inquired  into the condition that was holding back the Tete Jaune train. He found  that a slide had given way, burying a section of track under gravel and  rock. A hundred men were at work clearing it away, and it was probable  they would finish by noon. A gang boss, who had come back with  telegraphic reports, said that half a dozen men had carried Quade's  hand-car over the obstruction about midnight.
  It was seven o'clock when Aldous left for the Miette bottom. He  believed that Joanne would be up. At this season of the year the first  glow of day usually found the Ottos at breakfast, and for half an hour  the sun had been shining on the top of Pyramid Mountain. He was eager  to tell her what had passed between him and Keller. He laughed softly  when he confessed to himself how madly he wanted to see her.
  He always liked to come up to the Otto home very early of a morning,  or in the dusk of evening. Very frequently he was filled with a desire  to stand outside the red-and-white striped walls of the tent-house and  listen unseen. Inside there was always cheer: at night the crackle of  fire and the glow of light, the happy laughter of the gentle-hearted  Scotchwoman, and the affectionate banter of her &#8220;big mountain man,&#8221; who  looked more like a brigand than the luckiest and most contented husband  in the mountains&#8212;the luckiest, quite surely, with the one exception of  his brother Clossen, who had, by some occult strategy or other, induced  a sweet-faced and aristocratic little woman to look upon his own honest  physiognomy as the handsomest and finest in the world. This morning  Aldous followed a narrow path that brought him behind the tent-house.  He heard no voices. A few steps more and he emerged upon a scene that  stopped him and set his heart thumping.
  Less than a dozen paces away stood Mrs. Otto and Joanne, their backs  toward him. They were gazing silently and anxiously in the direction of  the thick, low bush across the clearing, through which led the trail to  his cabin. He did not look toward the bush. His eyes were upon Joanne.  Her slender figure was full in the golden radiance of the morning sun,  and Aldous felt himself under the spell of a joyous wonder as he looked  at her. For the first time he saw her hair as he had pictured it&#8212;as he  had given it to that other<I> Joanne</I> in the book he had called  &#8220;Fair Play.&#8221; She had been brushing it in the sun when he came, but now  she stood poised in that tense and waiting attitude&#8212;silent&#8212;gazing in  the direction of the bush, with that marvellous mantle sweeping about  her in a shimmering silken flood. He would not have moved, nor would he  have spoken, until Joanne herself broke the spell. She turned, and saw  him. With a little cry of surprise she flung back her hair. He could  not fail to see the swift look of relief and gladness that had come  into her eyes. In another instant her face was flushing crimson.
  &#8220;I beg your pardon for coming up like an eavesdropper,&#8221; he  apologized. &#8220;I thought you would just about be at breakfast, Mrs.  Otto.&#8221;
  The Scotchwoman heaved a tremendous sigh of relief.
  &#8220;Goodness gracious, but I'm glad to see you!&#8221; she exclaimed  thankfully. &#8220;Jack and Bruce have just gone out to see if they could  find your dead body!&#8221;
  &#8220;We thought perhaps something might have happened,&#8221; said Joanne, who  had moved nearer the door. &#8220;You will excuse me, won't you, while I  finish my hair?&#8221;
  Without waiting for him to answer, she ran into the tent. No sooner  had she disappeared than the good-natured smile left Mrs. Otto's face.  There was a note of alarm in her low voice as she whispered:
  &#8220;Jack and Bruce went to the barn last night, and she slept with me.  She tried to be quiet, but I know she didn't sleep much. And she cried.  I couldn't hear her, but the pillow was wet. Once my hand touched her  cheek, and it was wet. I didn't ask any questions. This morning, at  breakfast, she told us everything that happened, all about Quade&#8212;and  your trouble. She told us about Quade looking in at the window, and she  was so nervous thinking something might have happened to you last night  that the poor dear couldn't even drink her coffee until Jack and Bruce  went out to hunt for you. But I don't think that was why she cried!&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish it had been,&#8221; said Aldous. &#8220;It makes me happy to think she  was worried about&#8212;me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; gasped Mrs. Otto.
  He looked for a moment into the slow-growing amazement and  understanding in her kind eyes.
  &#8220;You will keep my little secret, won't you, Mrs. Otto?&#8221; he asked.  &#8220;Probably you'll think it's queer. I've only known her a day. But I  feel&#8212;like that. Somehow I feel that in telling this to you I am  confiding in a mother, or a sister. I want you to understand why I'm  going on to Tete Jaune with her. That is why she was crying&#8212;because of  the dread of something up there. I'm going with her. She shouldn't go  alone.&#8221;
  Voices interrupted them, and they turned to find that Jack and Bruce  Otto had come out of the bush and were quite near. Aldous was sorry  that Joanne had spoken of his trouble with Quade. He did not want to  discuss the situation, or waste time in listening to further advice. He  was anxious to be alone again with Joanne, and tell her what he had  learned from Peter Keller. For half an hour he repressed his  uneasiness. The brothers then went on to their corral. A few minutes  later Joanne was once more at his side, and they were walking slowly  over the trail that led to the cabin on the river.
  He could see that the night had made a change in her. There were  circles under her eyes which were not there yesterday. When she looked  at him their velvety blue depths betrayed something which he knew she  was struggling desperately to keep from him. It was not altogether  fear. It was more a betrayal of pain&#8212;a torment of the soul and not of  the body. He noticed that in spite of the vivid colouring of her lips  her face was strangely pale. The beautiful flush that had come into it  when she first saw him was gone.
  Then he began to tell her of his visit to Peter Keller. His own  heart was beating violently when he came to speak of the grave and the  slab over it that bore the name of FitzHugh. He had expected that what  he had discovered from Keller would create some sort of a sensation. He  had even come up to the final fact gradually, so that it would not  appear bald and shocking. Joanne's attitude stunned him. She looked  straight ahead. When she turned to him he did not see in her eyes what  he had expected to see. They were quiet, emotionless, except for that  shadow of inward torture which did not leave them.
  &#8220;Then to-morrow we can go to the grave?&#8221; she asked simply.
  Her voice, too, was quiet and without emotion.
  He nodded. &#8220;We can leave at sunrise,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I have my own horses  at Tete Jaune and there need be no delay. We were to start into the  North from there.&#8221;
  &#8220;You mean on the adventure you were telling me about?&#8221;
  She had looked at him quickly.
  &#8220;Yes. Old Donald, my partner, has been waiting for me a week. That's  why I was so deuced anxious to rush the book to an end. I'm behind  Donald's schedule, and he's growing nervous. It's rather an unusual  enterprise that's taking us north this time, and Donald can't  understand why I should hang back to write the tail end of a book. He  has lived sixty years in the mountains. His full name is Donald  MacDonald. Sometimes, back in my own mind, I've called him History. He  seems like that&#8212;as though he'd lived for ages in these mountains  instead of sixty years. If I could only write what he has lived&#8212;even  what one might imagine that he has lived! But I cannot. I have tried  three times, and have failed. I think of him as The Last Spirit&#8212;a  strange wandering ghost of the mighty ranges. His kind passed away a  hundred years ago. You will understand&#8212;when you see him.&#8221;
  She put her hand on his arm and let it rest there lightly as they  walked. Into her eyes had returned some of the old warm glow of  yesterday.
  &#8220;I want you to tell me about this adventure,&#8221; she entreated softly.  &#8220;I understand&#8212;about the other. You have been good&#8212;oh! so good to me!  And I should tell you things; you are expecting me to explain. It is  only fair and honest that I should. I know what is in your mind, and I  only want you to wait&#8212;until to-morrow. Will you? And I will tell you  then, when we have found the grave.&#8221;
  Involuntarily his hand sought Joanne's. For a single moment he felt  the warm, sweet thrill of it in his own as he pressed it more closely  to his arm. Then he freed it, looking straight ahead. A soft flush grew  in Joanne's cheeks.
  &#8220;Do you care a great deal for riches?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Does the golden  pot at the end of the rainbow hold out a lure for you?&#8221; He did not  realize the strangeness of his question until their eyes met. &#8220;Because  if you don't,&#8221; he added, smiling, &#8220;this adventure of ours isn't going  to look very exciting to you.&#8221;
  She laughed softly.
  &#8220;No, I don't care for riches,&#8221; she replied. &#8220;I am quite sure that  just as great education proves to one how little one knows, so great  wealth brings one face to face with the truth of how little one can  enjoy. My father used to say that the golden treasure at the end of the  rainbow in every human life was happiness, and that is something which  you cannot buy. So why crave riches, then? But please don't let my  foolish ideas disappoint you. I'll promise to be properly excited.&#8221;
  She saw his face suddenly aflame with enthusiasm.
  &#8220;By George, but you're a&#8212;a brick, Joanne!&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;You are!  And I&#8212;I&#8212;&#8212;&#8221; He was fumbling in his breast pocket. He brought out his  wallet and extracted from it the bit of paper Stevens had given him.  &#8220;You dropped that, and Stevens found it,&#8221; he explained, giving it to  her. &#8220;I thought those figures might represent your fortune&#8212;or your  income. Don't mind telling you I went over 'em carefully. There's a  mistake in the third column. Five and four don't make seven. They make  nine. In the final, when you come to the multiplication part of it,  that correction will make you just thirty-two thousand five hundred  dollars richer.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thanks,&#8221; said Joanne, lowering her eyes, and beginning to tear the  paper into small pieces. &#8220;And will it disappoint you, Mr. John Aldous,  if I tell you that all these figures stand for riches which some one  else possesses? And won't you let me remind you that we're getting a  long way from what I want to know&#8212;about your trip into the North?&#8221;
  &#8220;That's just it: we're hot on the trail,&#8221; chuckled Aldous,  deliberately placing her hand on his arm again. &#8220;You don't care for  riches. Neither do I. I'm delighted to know we're going tandem in that  respect. I've never had any fun with money. It's the money that's had  fun with me. I've no use for yachts and diamonds and I'd rather travel  afoot with a gun over my shoulder than in a private car. Half the time  I'm doing my own cooking, and I haven't worn a white shirt in a year.  My publishers persist in shoving more money my way than I know what to  do with.
  &#8220;You see, I pay only ten cents a plug for my smoking tobacco, and  other things accordingly. Somebody has said something about the good  Lord sitting up in Heaven and laughing at the jokes He plays on men.  Well, I'm sitting back and laughing now and then at the tussle between  men and money over all creation. There's a whole lot of humour in the  way men and women fight and die for money, if you only take time to  stand out on the side and look on. There's nothing big or dramatic  about it. I may be a heathen, but to my mind the funniest of all things  is to see the world wringing its neck for a dollar. And Donald&#8212;old  History&#8212;needs even less money than I. So that puts the big element of  humour in this expedition of ours. We don't want money, particularly.  Donald wouldn't wear more than four pairs of boots a year if he was a  billionaire. And yet&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  He turned to Joanne. The pressure of her hand was warmer on his arm.  Her beautiful eyes were glowing, and her red lips parted as she waited  breathlessly for him to go on.
  &#8220;And yet, we're going to a place where you can scoop gold up with a  shovel,&#8221; he finished. &#8220;That's the funny part of it.&#8221;
  &#8220;It isn't funny&#8212;it's tremendous!&#8221; gasped Joanne. &#8220;Think of what a  man like you could do with unlimited wealth, the good you might  achieve, the splendid endowments you might make&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I have already made several endowments,&#8221; interrupted Aldous. &#8220;I  believe that I have made a great many people happy, Ladygray&#8212;a great  many. I am gifted to make endowments, I think, above most people. Not  one of the endowments I have made has failed of complete success.&#8221;
  &#8220;And may I ask what some of them were?&#8221;
  &#8220;I can't remember them all. There have been a great, great many.  Most conspicuous among them were three endowments which I made to some  very worthy people at various times for seven salted mines. I suppose  you know what a salted mine is, Ladygray? At other times I have endowed  railroad stocks which were very much in need of my helping mite, two  copper companies, a concern that was supposed to hoist up pure asbestos  from the stomach of Popocatapetl, and a steamship company that never  steamed. As I said before, they were all very successful endowments.&#8221;
  &#8220;And how many of the other kind have you made?&#8221; she asked gently,  looking down the trail. &#8220;Like&#8212;Stevens', for instance?&#8221;
  He turned to her sharply.
  &#8220;What the deuce&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Did you succeed in getting the new outfit from Mr. Curly?&#8221; she  asked.
  &#8220;Yes. How did you know?&#8221;
  She smiled at the amazement which had gathered in his face. A glad,  soft light shone in her eyes.
  &#8220;I guess Mrs. Otto has been like a mother to that poor little boy,&#8221;  she explained. &#8220;When you and Mr. Stevens went up to buy the outfit this  morning Jimmy ran over to tell her the news. We were all there&#8212;at  breakfast. He was so excited he could scarcely breathe. But it all came  out, and he ran back to camp before you came because he thought you  wouldn't want me to know. Wasn't that funny? He told me so when I  walked a little way up the path with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;The little reprobate!&#8221; chuckled Aldous. &#8220;He's the best publicity  man I ever had, Ladygray. I did want you to know about this, and I  wanted it to come to you in just this way, so that I wouldn't be  compelled to tell you myself of the big and noble act I have done. It  was my hope and desire that you, through some one else, would learn of  it, and come to understand more fully what a generous and splendid  biped I am. I even plotted to give this child of Stevens' a silver  dollar if he would get the news to you in some one of his innocent  ways. He's done it. And he couldn't have done it better&#8212;even for a  dollar. Ah, here we are at the cabin. Will you excuse me while I pick  up a few things that I want to take on to Tete Jaune with me?&#8221;
  Between two trees close to the cabin he had built a seat, and here  he left Joanne. He was gone scarcely five minutes when he reappeared  with a small pack-sack over his shoulders, locked the door, and  rejoined her.
  &#8220;You see it isn't much of a task for me to move,&#8221; he said, as they  turned back in the direction of the Ottos'. &#8220;I'll wash the dishes when  I come back next October.&#8221;
  &#8220;Five months!&#8221; gasped Joanne, counting on her fingers. &#8220;John Aldous,  do you mean&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I do,&#8221; he nodded emphatically. &#8220;I frequently leave dishes unwashed  for quite a spell at a time. That's the one unpleasant thing about this  sort of life&#8212;washing dishes. It's not so bad in the rainy season, but  it's fierce during a dry spell. When it rains I put the dishes out on a  flat rock, dirty side up, and the good Lord does the scrubbing.&#8221;
  He looked at Joanne, face and eyes aglow with the happiness that was  sweeping in a mighty tumult within him. Half an hour had worked a  transformation in Joanne. There was no longer a trace of anguish or of  fear in her eyes. Their purity and limpid beauty made him think of the  rock violets that grew high up on the mountains. Her lips and cheeks  were flushed, and the soft pressure of her hand again resting on his  arm filled him with the exquisite thrill of possession and joy. He did  not speak of Tete Jaune again until they reached the Otto tent-house,  and then only to assure her that he would call for her half an hour  before the train was ready to leave.
  As soon as possible after that he went to the telegraph office and  sent a long message to MacDonald. Among other things he told him to  prepare their cabin for a lady guest. He knew this would shock the old  mountain wanderer, but he also knew that Donald would follow his  instructions in spite of whatever alarm he might have. There were other  women at Tete Jaune, the wives of men he knew, to whom he might have  taken Joanne. Under the conditions, however, he believed his own cabin  would be her best refuge, at least for a day or so. In that time he  could take some one into his confidence, probably Blackton and his  wife. In fact, as he thought the circumstances over, he saw the  necessity of confiding in the Blacktons that very night.
  He left the station, growing a bit nervous. Was it right for him to  take Joanne to his cabin at all? He had a tremendous desire to do so,  chiefly on account of Quade. The cabin was a quarter of a mile in the  bush, and he was positive if Joanne was there that Quade, and perhaps  Culver Rann, would come nosing about. This would give him the  opportunity of putting into execution a plan which he had already  arranged for himself and old MacDonald. On the other hand, was this  arrangement fair to Joanne, even though it gave him the chance to  square up accounts with Quade?
  He stopped abruptly, and faced the station. All at once there swept  upon him a realization of how blind he had been, and what a fool he had  almost made of himself. Blackton was one of the contractors who were  working miracles in the mountains. He was a friend who would fight for  him if necessary. Mrs. Blackton, who preferred to be on the firing line  with her husband than in her luxurious city home, was the leader of all  that was decent and womanly in Tete Jaune. Why not have these friends  meet them at the train and take Joanne direct to their house? Such  recognition and friendship would mean everything to Joanne. To take her  to his cabin would mean&#8212;&#8212;
  Inwardly he swore at himself as he hurried back to the station, and  his face burned hotly as he thought of the chance such a blunder on his  part would have given Quade and Culver Rann to circulate the stories  with which they largely played their scoundrelly game. He sent another  and longer telegram. This time it was to Blackton.
  He ate dinner with Stevens, who had his new outfit ready for the  mountains. It was two o'clock before he brought Joanne up to the  station. She was dressed now as he had first seen her when she entered  Quade's place. A veil covered her face. Through the gray film of it he  caught the soft warm glow of her eyes and the shimmer of gold-brown  tendrils of her hair. And he knew why she wore that veil. It set his  heart beating swiftly&#8212;the fact that she was trying to hide from all  eyes but his own a beauty so pure and wonderful that it made her  uncomfortable when under the staring gaze of the Horde.
  The hand that rested on his arm he pressed closer to his side as  they walked up the station platform, and under his breath he laughed  softly and joyously as he felt the thrill of it. He spoke no word. Not  until they were in their seat in the coach did Joanne look at him after  that pressure of her hand, and then she did not speak. But in the  veiled glow of her eyes there was something that told him she  understood&#8212;a light that was wonderfully gentle and sweet. And yet,  without words, she asked him to keep within his soul the things that  were pounding madly there for speech.
  As the train rolled on and the babble of voices about them joined  the crunching rumble of the wheels, he wanted to lean close to her and  tell her how a few hours had changed the world for him. And then, for a  moment, her eyes turned to him again, and he knew that it would be a  sacrilege to give voice to the things he wanted to say. For many  minutes he was silent, gazing with her upon the wild panorama of  mountain beauty as it drifted past the car window. A loud voice two  seats ahead of them proclaimed that they were about to make Templeton's  Curve. The man was talking to his companion.
  &#8220;They shot up a hundred thousand pounds of black powder an' dynamite  to make way for two hundred feet of steel on that curve,&#8221; he explained  in a voice heard all over the car. &#8220;They say you could hear the  explosion fifty miles away. Jack Templeton was near-sighted, an' he  didn't see a rock coming down on him that was half as big as a house. I  helped scrape up what was left of 'im an' we planted him at this end of  the curve. It's been Templeton's Curve ever since. You'll see his  grave&#8212;with a slab over it!&#8221;
  It was there almost as he spoke, marked by a white-painted cross in  a circle of whitewashed stones. John Aldous felt a sudden shiver pass  through his companion. She turned from the window. Through her veil he  saw her lips tighten. Until he left the car half an hour later the man  in the second seat ahead talked of Templeton's grave and a dozen other  graves along the right of way. He was a rock-hog, and a specialist on  the subject of graves. Inwardly Aldous cursed him roundly. He cursed  him all the way to Tete Jaune, for to him he attributed the change  which had again come over Joanne.
  This change she could only partly conceal from him under her veil.  She asked him many questions about Tete Jaune and the Blacktons, and  tried to take an interest in the scenery they were passing. In spite of  this he could see that she was becoming more and more nervous as they  progressed toward the end of their journey. He felt the slow dampening  of his own joy, the deadening clutch of yesterday at his heart. Twice  she lifted her veil for a moment and he saw she was pale and the tense  lines had gathered about her mouth again. There was something almost  haggard in her look the second time.
  In the early dusk of evening they arrived at Tete Jaune. Aldous  waited until the car had emptied itself before he rose from his seat.  Joanne's hand clutched at his arm as they walked down the aisle. He  felt the fierce pressure of her fingers in his flesh. On the car  platform they paused for a moment, and he felt her throbbing beside  him. She had taken her hand from his arm, and he turned suddenly. She  had raised her veil. Her face was dead white. And she was staring out  over the sea of faces under them in a strange questing way, and her  breath came from between her slightly parted lips as if she had been  running. Amazed for the moment, John Aldous did not move. Somewhere in  that crowd<I> Joanne expected to find a face she knew!</I> The truth  struck him dumb&#8212;made him inert and lifeless. He, too, stared as if in  a trance. And then, suddenly, every drop of blood in his body blazed  into fierce life.
  In the glow of one of the station lamps stood a group of men. The  faces of all were turned toward them. One he recognized&#8212;a bloated,  leering face grinning devilishly at them. It was Quade!
  A low, frightened cry broke from Joanne's lips, and he knew that  she, too, had seen him. But it was not Quade that she had looked for.  It was not his face that she had expected to see nor because of him  that she had lifted her veil for the mob!
  He stepped down from the car and gave her his hand. Her fingers  clutched his convulsively. And they were cold as the fingers of the  dead.
