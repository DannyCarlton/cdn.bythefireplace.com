   For perhaps the first time in his life Howland felt the spirit of  romance, of adventure, of sympathy for the picturesque and the unknown  surging through his veins. A billion stars glowed like yellow,  passionless eyes in the polar cold of the skies. Behind him, white in  its sinuous twisting through the snow-smothered wilderness, lay the icy  Saskatchewan, with a few scattered lights visible where Prince Albert,  the last outpost of civilization, came down to the river half a mile  away.
  But it was into the North that Howland looked. From the top of the  great ridge which he had climbed he gazed steadily into the white gloom  which reached for a thousand miles from where he stood to the Arctic  Sea. Faintly in the grim silence of the winter night there came to his  ears the soft hissing sound of the aurora borealis as it played in its  age-old song over the dome of the earth, and as he watched the cold  flashes shooting like pale arrows through the distant sky and listened  to its whispering music of unending loneliness and mystery, there came  on him a strange feeling that it was beckoning to him and calling to  him&#8212;telling him that up there very near to the end of the earth lay  all that he had dreamed of and hoped for since he had grown old enough  to begin the shaping of a destiny of his own.
  He shivered as the cold nipped at his blood, and lighted a fresh  cigar, half-turning to shield himself from a wind that was growing out  of the east. As the match flared in the cup of his hands for an instant  there came from the black gloom of the balsam and spruce at his feet a  wailing, hungerful cry that brought a startled breath from his lips. It  was a cry such as Indian dogs make about the tepees of masters who are  newly dead. He had never heard such a cry before, and yet he knew that  it was a wolf's. It impressed him with an awe which was new to him and  he stood as motionless as the trees about him until, from out the gray  night-gloom to the west, there came an answering cry, and then, from  far to the north, still another.
  &#8220;Sounds as though I'd better go back to town,&#8221; he said to himself,  speaking aloud. &#8220;By George, but it's lonely!&#8221;
  He descended the ridge, walked rapidly over the hard crust of the  snow across the Saskatchewan, and assured himself that he felt  considerably easier when the lights of Prince Albert gleamed a few  hundred yards ahead of him.
  Jack Howland was a Chicago man, which means that he was a hustler,  and not overburdened with sentiment. For fifteen of his thirty-one  years he had been hustling. Since he could easily remember, he had  possessed to a large measure but one ambition and one hope. With a  persistence which had left him peculiarly a stranger to the more  frivolous and human sides of life he had worked toward the achievement  of this ambition, and to-night, because that achievement was very near  at hand, he was happy. He had never been happier. There flashed across  his mental vision a swiftly moving picture of the fight he had made for  success. It had been a magnificent fight. Without vanity he was proud  of it, for fate had handicapped him at the beginning, and still he had  won out. He saw himself again the homeless little farmer boy setting  out from his Illinois village to take up life in a great city; as  though it had all happened but yesterday he remembered how for days and  weeks he had nearly starved, how he had sold papers at first, and then,  by lucky chance, became errand boy in a big drafting establishment. It  was there that the ambition was born in him. He saw great engineers  come and go&#8212;men who were greater than presidents to him, and who  sought out the ends of the earth in the following of their vocation. He  made a slave of himself in the nurturing and strengthening of his  ambition to become one of them&#8212;to be a builder of railroads and  bridges, a tunneler of mountains, a creator of new things in new lands.  His slavery had not lessened as his years increased. Voluntarily he had  kept himself in bondage, fighting ceaselessly the obstacles in his way,  triumphing over his handicaps as few other men had triumphed, rising,  slowly, steadily, resistlessly, until now&#8212;. He flung back his head and  the pulse of his heart quickened as he heard again the words of Van  Horn, president of the greatest engineering company on the continent.
  &#8220;Howland, we've decided to put you in charge Of the building of the  Hudson Bay Railroad. It's one of the wildest jobs we've ever had, and  Gregson and Thorne don't seem to catch on. They're bridge builders and  not wilderness men. We've got to lay a single line of steel through  three hundred miles of the wildest country in North America, and from  this hour your motto is 'Do it or bust!' You can report at Le Pas as  soon as you get your traps together.&#8221;
  Those words had broken the slavedom for Howland. He had been  fighting for an opportunity, and now that the opportunity had come he  was sure that he would succeed. Swiftly, with his hands thrust deep in  his pockets, he walked down the one main street of Prince Albert,  puffing out odorous clouds of smoke from his cigar, every fiber in him  tingling with the new joy that had come into his life. Another night  would see him in Le Pas, the little outpost sixty miles farther east on  the Saskatchewan. Then a hundred miles by dog-sledge and he would be in  the big wilderness camp where three hundred men were already at work  clearing a way to the great bay to the north. What a glorious  achievement that road would be! It would remain for all time as a  cenotaph to his ability, his courage and indomitable persistence.
  It was past nine o'clock when Howland entered the little old Windsor  Hotel. The big room, through the windows of which he could look out on  the street and across the frozen Saskatchewan, was almost empty. The  clerk had locked his cigar-case and had gone to bed. In one corner,  partly shrouded in gloom, sat a half-breed trapper who had come in that  day from the Lac la Ronge country, and at his feet crouched one of his  wolfish sledge-dogs. Both were wide-awake and stared curiously at  Howland as he came in. In front of the two large windows sat half a  dozen men, as silent as the half-breed, clad in moccasins and thick  caribou skin coats. One of them was the factor from a Hudson Bay post  at Lac Bain who had not been down to the edge of civilization for three  years; the others, including two Crees and a Chippewayan, were hunters  and Post men who had driven in their furs from a hundred miles to the  north.
  For a moment Howland paused in the middle of the room and looked  about him. Ordinarily he would have liked this quiet, and would have  gone to one of the two rude tables to write a letter or work out a  problem of some sort, for he always carried a pocketful of problems  about with him. His fifteen years of study and unceasing slavery to his  ambition had made him naturally as taciturn as these grim men of the  North, who were born to silence. But to-night there had come a change  over him. He wanted to talk. He wanted to ask questions. He longed for  human companionship, for some kind of mental exhilaration beyond that  furnished by his own thoughts. Feeling in his pocket for a cigar he  seated himself before one of the windows and proffered it to the factor  from Lac Bain.
  &#8220;You smoke?&#8221; he asked companionably.
  &#8220;I was born in a wigwam,&#8221; said the factor slowly, taking the cigar.  &#8220;Thank you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Deuced polite for a man who hasn't seen civilization for three  years,&#8221; thought Howland, seating himself comfortably, with his feet on  the window-sill. Aloud he said, &#8220;The clerk tells me you are from Lac  Bain. That's a good distance north, isn't it?&#8221;
  &#8220;Four hundred miles,&#8221; replied the factor with quiet terseness.  &#8220;We're on the edge of the Barren Lands.&#8221;
  &#8220;Whew!&#8221; Howland shrugged his shoulders. Then he volunteered, &#8220;I'm  going north myself to-morrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;Post man?&#8221;
  &#8220;No; engineer. I'm putting through the Hudson Bay Railroad.&#8221;
  He spoke the words quite clearly and as they fell from his lips the  half-breed, partly concealed in the gloom behind him, straightened with  the alert quickness of a cat. He leaned forward eagerly, his black eyes  gleaming, and then rose softly from his seat. His moccasined feet made  no sound as he came up behind Howland. It was the big huskie who first  gave a sign of his presence. For a moment the upturned eyes of the  young engineer met those of the half-breed. That look gave Howland a  glimpse of a face which he could never forget&#8212;a thin, dark, sensitive  face framed in shining, jet-black hair, and a pair of eyes that were  the most beautiful he had ever seen in a man. Sometimes a look decides  great friendship or bitter hatred between men. And something, nameless,  unaccountable, passed between these two. Not until the half-breed had  turned and was walking swiftly away did Howland realize that he wanted  to speak to him, to grip him by the hand, to know him by name. He  watched the slender form of the Northerner, as lithe and as graceful in  its movement as a wild thing of the forests, until it passed from the  door out into the night.
  &#8220;Who was that?&#8221; he asked, turning to the factor.
  &#8220;His name is Croisset. He comes from the Wholdaia country, beyond  Lac la Ronge.&#8221;
  &#8220;French?&#8221;
  &#8220;Half French, half Cree.&#8221;
  The factor resumed his steady gaze out into the white distance of  the night, and Howland gave up his effort at conversation. After a  little his companion shoved back his chair and bade him good night. The  Crees and Chippewayan followed him, and a few minutes later the two  white hunters left the engineer alone before the windows.
  &#8220;Mighty funny people,&#8221; he said half aloud. &#8220;Wonder if they ever  talk!&#8221;
  He leaned forward, elbows on knees, his face resting in his hands,  and stared to catch a sign of moving life outside. In him there was no  desire for sleep. Often he had called himself a night-bird, but seldom  had he been more wakeful than on this night. The elation of his  triumph, of his success, had not yet worn itself down to a normal and  reasoning satisfaction, and his chief longing was for the day, and the  day after that, and the next day, when he would take the place of  Gregson and Thorne. Every muscle in his body was vibrant in its desire  for action. He looked at his watch. It was only ten o'clock. Since  supper he had smoked almost ceaselessly. Now he lighted another cigar  and stood up close to one of the windows.
  Faintly he caught the sound of a step on the board walk outside. It  was a light, quick step, and for an instant it hesitated, just out of  his vision. Then it approached, and suddenly the figure of a woman  stopped in front of the window. How she was dressed Howland could not  have told a moment later. All that he saw was the face, white in the  white night&#8212;a face on which the shimmering starlight fell as it was  lifted to his gaze, beautiful, as clear-cut as a cameo, with eyes that  looked up at him half-pleadingly, half-luringly, and lips parted, as if  about to speak to him. He stared, moveless in his astonishment, and in  another breath the face was gone.
  With a hurried exclamation he ran across the empty room to the door  and looked down the starlit street. To go from the window to the door  took him but a few seconds, yet he found the street deserted&#8212;deserted  except for a solitary figure three blocks away and a dog that growled  at him as he thrust out his head and shoulders. He heard no sound of  footsteps, no opening or closing of a door. Only there came to him that  faint, hissing music of the northern skies, and once more, from the  black forest beyond the Saskatchewan, the infinite sadness of the  wolf-howl.
