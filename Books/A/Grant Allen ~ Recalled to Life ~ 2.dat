Wha happened after is far more vague to me. Compared with the  vividness of that one initial Picture, the events of the next few  months have only the blurred indistinctness of all childish  memories. For I was a child once more, in all save stature, and had  to learn to remember things just like other children.    
I will try to tell the whole tale over again exactly as it then  struck me.    
After the Picture, I told you, I shut my eyes in alarm for a second.  When I opened them once more there was a noise, a very great noise,  and my recollection is that people had burst wildly into the room,  and were lifting the dead body, and bending over it in astonishment,  and speaking loud to me, and staring at me. I believe they broke the  door open, though that's rather inference than memory; I learnt it  afterwards. Soon some of them rushed to the open window and looked  out into the garden. Then, suddenly, a man gave a shout, and leaping  on to the sill, jumped down in pursuit, as I thought, of the  murderer. As time went on, more people flocked in; and some of them  looked at the body and the pool of blood; and some of them turned  round and spoke to me. But what they said or what they meant I  hadn't the slightest idea. The noise of the pistol-shot still rang  loud in my ears: the ineffable Horror still drowned all my senses.    
After a while, another man came in, with an air of authority, and  felt my pulse and my brow, and lifted me on to a sofa. But I didn't  even remember there was such a thing as a doctor. I lay there for a  while, quite dazed; and the man, who was kindly-looking and  close-shaven and fatherly, gave me something in a glass: after which  he turned round and examined the body. He looked hard at the  revolver, too, and chalked its place on the ground. Then I saw no  more, for two women lifted me in their arms and took me up to bed;  and with that, the first scene of my childhood seemed to end  entirely.    
I lay in bed for a day or two, during which time I was dimly aware  of much commotion going on here and there in the house; and the  doctor came night and morning, and tended me carefully. I suppose I  may call him the doctor now, though at the time I didn't call him  so--I knew him merely as a visible figure. I don't believe I <i>thought</i>  at all during those earliest days, or gave things names in any known  language. They rather passed before me dreamily in long procession,  like a vague panorama. When people spoke to me, it was like the  sound of a foreign tongue. I attached no more importance to anything  they said than to the cawing of the rooks in the trees by the  rectory.    
At the end of five days, the doctor came once more, and watched me a  great deal, and spoke in a low voice with a woman in a white cap and  a clean white apron who waited on me daily. As soon as he was gone,  my nurse, as I learned afterwards to call her,--it's so hard not to  drop into the language of everyday life when one has to describe  things to other people,--my nurse got me up, with much ado and  solemnity, and dressed me in a new black frock, very dismal and  ugly, and put on me a black hat, with a dreary-looking veil; and  took me downstairs, with the aid of a man who wore a suit of blue  clothes and a queer kind of helmet. The man was of the sort I now  call a policeman. These pictures are far less definite in my mind  than the one that begins my second life; but still, in a vague kind  of way, I pretty well remember them.    
On the ground floor, nurse made me walk; and I walked out to the  door, where a cab was in waiting, drawn slowly by a pair of horses.  People were looking on, on either side, between the door and the  cab--great crowds of people, peering eagerly forward; and two more  men in blue suits were holding them off by main force from surging  against me and incommoding me. I don't think they wanted to hurt me:  it was rather curiosity than anger I saw in their faces. But I was  afraid, and shrank back. They were eager to see me, however, and  pressed forward with loud cries, so that the men in blue suits had  hard work to prevent them.    
I know now there were two reasons why they wanted to see me. I was  the murdered man's daughter, and I was a Psychological Phenomenon.    
We drove away, through green lanes, in the cab, nurse and I; and in  spite of the Horror, which surrounded me always, and the Picture,  which recurred every time I shut my eyes to think, I enjoyed that  drive very much, with all the fresh vividness of childish pleasure.  Though I learnt later I was eighteen years old at least, I was in my  inner self just like a baby of ten months, going ta-ta. At the end  of the drive, we drew up sharp at a house, where some more men stood  about, with red bands on their caps, and took boxes from the cab and  put them into a van, while nurse and I got into a different  carriage, drawn quickly by a thing that went puff-puff, puff-puff. I  didn't know it was a railway, and yet in a way I did. I half forgot,  half remembered it. Things that I'd seen in my previous state seemed  to come back to me, in fact, as soon as I saw them; or at least to  be more familiar to me than things I'd never seen before. Especially  afterwards. But while things were remembered, persons, I found  by-and-by, were completely forgotten. Or rather, while I remembered  after a while generalities, such as houses and men, recognising them  in the abstract as a house, or a man, or a horse, or a baby, I  forgot entirely particulars, such as the names of people and the  places I had lived in. Words soon came back to me: names and facts  were lost: I knew the world as a whole, not my own old part in it.    
Well, not to make my story too long in these early childish stages,  we went on the train, as it seemed to me, a long way across fields  to Aunt Emma's. I didn't know she was Aunt Emma then for, indeed, I  had never seen her before; but I remember arriving there at her  pretty little cottage, and seeing a sweet old lady--barely sixty, I  should say, but with smooth white hair,--who stood on the steps of  the house and cried like a child, and held out her hands to me, and  hugged me and kissed me. And it was there that I learned my first  word. A great many times over, she spoke about "Una." She said it so  often, I caught vaguely at the sound. And nurse, when she answered  her, said "Una" also. Then, when Aunt Emma called me, she always  said "Una." So it came to me dimly that Una meant <i>me</i>. But I didn't  exactly recollect it had been my name before, though I learned in  due time afterwards that I'd always been called so. However, just at  first, I picked up the word as a child might pick it up; and when,  some months later, I began to talk easily, I spoke of myself always  in the third person as Una. I can remember with a smile now how I  went one day to Aunt Emma--I, a great girl of eighteen--and held up  my skirt, that I'd muddied in the street, and said to her, with  great gravity:    
"Una naughty girl: Una got her frock wet. Aunt Emma going to scold  poor Una for being so naughty!"    
Not that I often smiled, in those days; for, in spite of Aunt Emma's  kindness, my second girlhood, like my first, was a very unhappy one.  The Horror and the Picture pursued me too close. It was months and  months before I could get rid for a moment of that persistent  nightmare. And yet I had everything else on earth to make me happy.  Aunt Emma lived in a pretty east-coast town, with high bracken-clad  downs, and breezy common beyond; while in front stretched great  sands, where I loved to race about and to play cricket and tennis.  It was the loveliest town that ever you saw in your life, with a  broken chancel to the grand old church, and a lighthouse on a hill,  with delicious views to seaward. The doctor had sent me there (I  know now) as soon as I was well enough to move, in order to get me  away from the terrible associations of The Grange at Woodbury. As  long as I lived in the midst of scenes which would remind me of poor  father, he said, and of his tragical death, there was no hope of my  recovery. The only chance for me to regain what I had lost in that  moment of shock was complete change of air, of life, of  surroundings. Aunt Emma, for her part, was only too glad to take me  in: and as poor papa had died intestate, Aunt Emma was now, of  course, my legal guardian.    
She was my mother's sister, I learned as time went on; and there had  been feud while he lived between her and my father. Why, I couldn't  imagine. She was the sweetest old soul I ever knew, indeed, and what  on earth he could have quarrelled with her about I never could  fathom. She tended me so carefully that as months went by, the  Horror began to decrease and my soul to become calm again. I grew  gradually able to remain in a room alone for a few minutes at a  time, and to sleep at night in a bed by myself, if only there was a  candle, and nurse was in another bed in the same room close by me.    
Yet every now and again a fresh shivering fit came on. At such times  I would cover my head with the bedclothes and cower, and see the  Picture even so floating visibly in mid-air like a vision before me.    
My second education must have been almost as much of a business as  my first had been, only rather less longsome. I had first to relearn  the English language, which came back to me by degrees, much  quicker, of course, than I had picked it up in my childhood. Then I  had to begin again with reading, writing, and arithmetic--all new  to me in a way, and all old in another. Whatever I learned and  whatever I read seemed novel while I learned it, but familiar the  moment I had thoroughly grasped it. To put it shortly, I could  remember nothing of myself, but I could recall many things, after a  time, as soon as they were told me clearly. The process was rather a  process of reminding than of teaching, properly so called. But it  took some years for me to recall things, even when I was reminded of  them.    
I spent four years at Aunt Emma's, growing gradually to my own age  again. At the end of that time I was counted a girl of twenty-two,  much like any other. But I was older than my age; and the shadow of  the Horror pursued me incessantly.    
All that time I knew, too, from what I heard said in the house that  my father's murderer had never been caught, and that nobody even  knew who he was, or anything definite about him. The police gave him  up as an uncaught criminal. He was still at large, and might always  be so. I knew this from vague hints and from vague hints alone; for  whenever I tried to ask, I was hushed up at once with an air of  authority.    
"Una, dearest," Aunt Emma would say, in her quiet fashion, "you  mustn't talk about that night. I have Dr. Wade's strict orders that  nothing must be said to you about it, and above all nothing that  could in any way excite or arouse you."    
So I was fain to keep my peace; for though Aunt Emma was kind, she  ruled me still in all things like a little girl, as I was when I  came to her.
