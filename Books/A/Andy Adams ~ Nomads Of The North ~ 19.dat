  During the last few days in December all trails for ten thousand   square miles around led to Post Fort 0' God. It was the eve of  OOSKE  PIPOON&#8212;of the New Year&#8212;the mid-winter carnival time of the  people of  the wilderness, when from teepees and cabins far and  near come the  trappers and their families to sell their furs and  celebrate for a few  days with others of their kind. To this New  Year gathering men, women,  and children look forward through long  and weary months. The trapper's  wife has no neighbour. Her  husband's &quot;line&quot; is a little kingdom  inviolate, with no other  human life within many miles of it; so for  the women the OOSKE  PIPOON is a time of rejoicing; for the children it  is the &quot;big  circus,&quot; and for the men a reward for the labour and  hardship of  catching their fur. During these few days old  acquaintanceships  are renewed and new ones are made. It is here that  the &quot;news&quot; of  the trackless wilderness is spread, the news of deaths,  of  marriages, and of births; of tragic happenings that bring horror   and grief and tears, and of others that bring laughter and joy.  For  the first and last time in all the seven months' winter the  people of  the forests &quot;come to town.&quot; Indian, halfbreed, &quot;blood,&quot;  and white man,  join in the holiday without distinction of colour  or creed. 
  This year there was to be a great caribou roast, a huge barbecue,   at Fort O' God, and by the time Henri Durant came within half a  dozen  miles of the Post the trails from north and south and east  and west  were beaten hard by the tracks of dogs and men. That year  a hundred  sledges came in from the forests, and with them were  three hundred men  and women and children and half a thousand dogs. 
  Durant was a day later than he had planned to be, but he had made   good use of his time. For Miki, while still muzzled, now followed  at  the end of the babiche that was tied to Henri's sledge. In the   afternoon of the third day after leaving Nanette Le Beau's cabin   Durant turned off the main-travelled trail until he came to the  shack  of Andre Ribon, who kept the Factor and his people at the  Post  supplied with fresh meat. Andre, who was becoming over-  anxious at  Durant's delay, was still waiting when his friend came.  It was here  that Henri's Indian had left his fighting dog, the big  husky. And here  he left Miki, locked in Andre's shack. Then the  two men went on to the  Post which was only a mile away. 
  Neither he nor Ribon returned that night. The cabin was empty. And   with the beginning of dusk Miki began to hear weird and strange   sounds which grew louder as darkness settled deeper. It was the  sound  of the carnival at the Post&#8212;the distant tumult of human  voice mingled  with the howling of a hundred dogs. He had never  heard anything like  it before, and for a long time he listened  without moving. Then he  stood up like a man before the window with  this fore-paws resting  against the heavy sash. Ribon's cabin was  at the crest of a knoll that  over-looked the frozen lake, and far  off, over the tops of the scrub  timber that fringed the edge of  it, Miki saw the red glow in the sky  made by a score of great camp  fires. He whined, and dropped on his  four feet again. It was a  long wait between that and another day. But  the cabin was more  comfortable than Le Beau's prison-cage had been.  All through the  night his restless slumber was filled with visions of  Nanette and  the baby. 
  Durant and Ribon did not return until nearly noon the next day.   They brought with them fresh meat, of which Miki ate ravenously,  for  he was hungry. In an unresponsive way he tolerated the  advances of  these two. A second night he was left alone in the  cabin. When Durant  and Ribon came back again in the early dawn  they brought with them a  cage four feet square made of small birch  saplings. The open door of  this cage they drew close to the door  of the cabin, and by means of a  chunk of fresh meat Miki was  induced to enter through it. Instantly  the trap fell, and he was a  prisoner. The cage was already fastened on  a wide toboggan, and  scarcely was the sun up when Miki was on his way  to Fort O' God. 
  This was the big day at the carnival&#8212;the day of the caribou-roast   and the fight. For many minutes before they came in sight of Fort  O'  God Miki heard the growing sound. It amazed him, and he stood  up on  his feet in his cage, rigid and alert, utterly unconscious  of the men  who were pulling him. He was looking ahead of them, and  Durant  chuckled exultantly as they heard him growl, and his teeth  click. 
  &quot;Oui, he will fight! He would fight NOW,&quot; he chuckled. 
  They were following the shore of a lake. Suddenly they came around   the end of a point, and all of Fort O' God lay on the rising shelf  of  the shore ahead of them. The growl died in Miki's throat. His  teeth  shut with a last click. For an instant his heart seemed to  grow dead  and still. Until this moment his world had held only  half a dozen  human beings. Now, so suddenly that he had no flash  of warning, he saw  a hundred of them, two hundred, three hundred.  At sight of Durant and  the cage a swarm of them began running down  to the shore. And  everywhere there were wolves, so many of them  that his senses grew  dazed as he stared. His cage was the centre  of a clamouring,  gesticulating horde of men and boys as it was  dragged up the slope.  Women began joining the crowd, many of them  with small children in  their arms. Then his journey came to an  end. He was close to another  cage, and in that cage was a beast  like himself. Beside this cage  there stood a tall, swarthy,  shaggy-headed halfbreed who looked like a  pirate. The man was  Grouse Piet, Durant's rival. 
  A contemptuous leer was on his thick-lipped face as he looked at   Miki. He turned, and to the group of dark-faced Indians and breeds   about him he said something that roused a guttural laugh. 
  Durant's face flamed red. 
  &quot;Laugh, you heathen,&quot; he challenged, &quot;but don't forget that Henri   Durant is here to take your bets!&quot; Then he shook the two cross and   ten red foxes in the face of Grouse Piet. 
  &quot;Cover them, Grouse Piet,&quot; he cried. &quot;And I have ten times more   where they came from!&quot; 
  With his muzzle lifted, Miki was sniffing the air. It was filled   with strange scents, heavy with the odours of men, of dogs, and of   the five huge caribou roasting on their spits fifteen feet over  the  big fires that were built under them. For ten hours those  caribou  would roast, turning slowly on spits as thick as a man's  leg. The  fight was to come before the feast. 
  For an hour the clatter and tumult of voices hovered about the two   cages. Men appraised the fighters and made their bets, and Grouse   Piet and Henri Durant made their throats hoarse flinging banter  and  contempt at each other. At the end of the hour the crowd began  to thin  out. In the place of men and women half a hundred dark-  visaged little  children crowded about the cages. It was not until  then that Miki  caught glimpses of the hordes of beasts fastened in  ones and twos and  groups in the edge of the clearing. His nostrils  had at last caught  the distinction. They were not wolves. They  were like himself. 
  It was a long time before his eyes rested steadily on the wolf-dog   in the other cage. He went to the edge of his bars and sniffed.  The  wolf-dog thrust his gaunt muzzle toward him. He made Miki  think of the  huge wolf he had fought one day on the edge of the  cliff, and  instinctively he showed his fangs, and snarled. The  wolf-dog snarled  back. Henri Durant rubbed his hands exultantly,  and Grouse Piet  laughed softly. 
  &quot;Oui; they will FIGHT!&quot; said Henri again. 
  &quot;Ze wolf, he will fight, oui,&quot; said Grouse Piet. &quot;But your dog,   m'sieu, he be vair seek, lak a puppy, w'en ze fight come!&quot; 
  A little later Miki saw a white man standing close to his cage. It   was MacDonnell, the Scotch factor. He gazed at Miki and the wolf-  dog  with troubled eyes. Ten minutes later, in the little room  which he had  made his office, he was saying to a younger man: 
  &quot;I'd like to stop it, but I can't. They wouldn't stand for it. It   would lose us half a season's catch of fur. There's been a fight  like  this at Fort O' God for the last fifty years, and I don't  suppose,  after all, that it's any worse than one of the prize  fights down  there. Only, in this case&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;They kill,&quot; said the younger man. 
  &quot;Yes, that's it. Usually one of the dogs dies.&quot; 
  The younger man knocked the ash out of his pipe. 
  &quot;I love dogs,&quot; he said, simply. &quot;There'll never be a fight at my   post, Mac&#8212;unless it's between men. And I'm not going to see this   fight, because I'm afraid I'd kill some one if I did.&quot;
