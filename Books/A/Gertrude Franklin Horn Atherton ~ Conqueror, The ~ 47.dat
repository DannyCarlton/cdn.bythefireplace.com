As the three men turned into Broadway they saluted a man who was  entering Wall Street. It was Hamilton, hastening home to his family  after the day's work. He had lost his boyish slenderness; his figure had  broadened and filled out sufficiently to add to his presence while  destroying nothing of its symmetry or agile grace, and it was dressed  with the same care. His face was as gay and animated as ever, responded  with the old mobility to every passing thought, but its lines and  contours showed the hard work and severe thought of the last four years.  When he was taking a brief holiday with his friends, or tumbling about  the floor with his little brood, he felt as much a boy as ever, but no  one appreciated more fully than he the terrible responsibility of his  position in the Confederation. His abilities, combined with his  patriotism, had forced him to the head of the Nationalist Party, for  whose existence he was in greatest measure responsible; and he hardly  dared to think of his personal ambitions, nor could he hesitate to  neglect his lucrative practice whenever the crying needs of the country  demanded it. He had also given much time to the creating and  organization of the Bank of New York. But Burr was not far wrong when he  accused him of impatience. His bearing was more imperious, his eye  flashed more intolerantly, than ever. To impute to him monarchical  ambitions was but the fling of a smarting jealousy, but it is quite true  that he felt he knew what was best for the country, and would have liked  to regulate its affairs without further hindrance.    
His house, beyond the dip of Wall Street and within sight of the bay,  was of red brick, and as unbeautiful architecturally as other New York  houses which had risen at random from the ruins. But within, it was very  charming. The long drawing-room was furnished with mahogany, and  rose-coloured brocade, with spindle-legged tables and many bibelots sent  by Angelica Church, now living in London. The library was filling with  valuable books, and the panelled whiteness of the dining room glittered  with silver and glass, which in quantity or value was not exceeded in  the home of any young couple in America; the world had outdone itself at  the most interesting wedding of the Revolution. Betsey's sitting room  was behind the drawing-room, and there Hamilton found her counting the  moments until his return. She had lost nothing of her slimness, and  except on dress occasions wore her mass of soft black hair twisted in a  loose knot and unpowdered. She looked younger and prettier than with  powder or wig, and Hamilton begged her to defy the fashion; but yielding  in all else, on this point she was inflexible. "I am wiser than you in  just a few things," she would say, playfully, for she firmly believed  him infallible; "my position would suffer, were I thought eccentric. You  cannot stand in rank without a uniform. I shall not yield to Sarah Jay  nor even Kitty Duer. I am a little Republican, sir, and know my rights.  And I know how to keep them."    
To-day, after her usual prolonged and unmitigated greeting, she  remarked: "Speaking of eccentric people, I met to-day, at Lady  Sterling's, that curious person, Mrs. Croix, or Miss Capet, as some will  call her. Her hair was built up quite a foot and unpowdered. On top of  it was an immense black hat with plumes, and her velvet gown was at  least three yards on the floor. She certainly is the handsomest creature  in town, but, considering all the gossip, I think it odd Lady Sterling  should take her up, and I believe that Kitty is quite annoyed. But Lady  Sterling is so good-natured, and I am told that Dr. Franklin went  personally and asked her to give this lady countenance. He calls her his  Fairy Queen, and to-day saluted her on the lips before all of us. Poor  dear Dr. Franklin is by now quite in the class with Caesar's wife, but  still I think his conduct rather remarkable."    
"Who is this woman?" asked Hamilton, indifferently.    
"Well!" exclaimed his wife, with a certain satisfaction, "you <i>are  busy</i>. She has been the talk of the town for quite three months,  although she never went <i>anywhere</i> before to-day."    
"I hear all my gossip from you," said Hamilton, smiling from the hearth  rug, "and considering the labours of the past three months--but tell me  about her. I believe I love you best when gossiping. Your effort to be  caustic is the sweetest thing in the world."    
She threw a ball of wool at him, which he caught and pulled apart, then  showered on her head. It was yellow wool, and vastly becoming on her  black hair. "You must have a yellow hat at once, with plumes," he said,  "but go on."    
"You shall wind that this evening, sir. Well, she came here about three  months ago with Captain Croix of the British army, and rumour hath it  that he left a wife in England, and that this lady's right to the royal  name of Capet is still unchallenged. The story goes that she was born  about eighteen years ago, on a French frigate bound for the West Indies,  that her mother died, and that, there being no one else of that royal  name on board, the Captain adopted her; but that a baby and a ship being  more than he could manage, he presented the baby to a humble friend at  Newport, by the name of Thompson, who brought her up virtuously, but  without eradicating the spirit of the age, and one fine day she  disappeared with Colonel Croix, and after a honeymoon which may have  been spent in the neighbourhood of any church between here and Rhode  Island, or of none, they arrived in New York, and took the finest  lodgings in town. I suppose Dr. Franklin was a friend of her humble  guardian, he is so philanthropic, and that he is willing to take my  lady's word that all is well--and perhaps it is. I feel myself quite  vicious in repeating the vaguest sort of gossip--active, though. Who  knows, if she had worn a wig, or an inch of powder, and employed the  accepted architect for her tower, she would have passed without  question? Another pillar for my argument, sir."    
"As it is, you are even willing to believe that she is a daughter of the  house of France," said Hamilton, with a hearty laugh. "Would that the  world were as easily persuaded of what is good for it as of what tickles  its pettiness. Shall you ask this daughter of the Capets to the house?"    
"I have not made up my mind," said Mrs. Hamilton, demurely.    
The two older children, Philip and Angelica, came tumbling into the  room, and Hamilton romped with them for a half-hour, then flung them  upon their mother, and watched them from the hearth rug. Betsey was  lovely with her children, who were beautiful little creatures, and  Hamilton was always arranging them in groups. The boy and girl pulled  down her hair with the yellow wool, until all her diminutive figure and  all her face, but its roguish black eyes, were extinguished; and  Hamilton forgot the country.    
Elizabeth Schuyler was a cleverer woman than her meed of credit has led  the world to believe. She understood Hamilton very well even then,  although, as his faults but added to his fascination in the eyes of  those that loved him, the knowledge did not detract from her happiness.  In many ways she made herself necessary to him; at that time she even  kept his papers in order. He talked to her freely on every subject that  interested him, from human nature to finance, taxes, and the law, and  she never permitted a yawn to threaten. He read aloud to her every line  he wrote, and while she would not have presumed to suggest, her sympathy  was one of his imperative needs. When his erratic fancy flashed him into  seductive meshes, she pulled a string and back he came. Perhaps this is  the reason why no specific account of his numerous alleged amours have  come down to us. He is vaguely accused of being the Lothario of his  time, irresistible and indefatigable; but of all famous men whose names  are enlivened with anecdotes of gallantry in the vast bulk of the  world's unwritten history, he alone is the hero of much mysterious  affirmation but of no particular romance. The Reynolds affair is open  history and not a case in point. It is probable that, owing to inherent  fickleness and Betsey's gentle manipulation, his affairs rarely lasted  long enough to attract attention. It is one of the accidents of life  that the world barely knew of his acquaintance with Eliza Croix, she who  has come down to us as Madame Jumel; and such a thing could not happen  twice. But whether or not he possessed in all their perfection the  proclivities of so great and impetuous and passionate a genius, it is  certain that he loved his wife devotedly, and above all other women, so  long as his being held together. His home was always his Mecca, and he  left it only when public duty compelled his presence in exile.
