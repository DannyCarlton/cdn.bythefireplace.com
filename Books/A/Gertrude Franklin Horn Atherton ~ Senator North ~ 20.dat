Senator North, until the last six days of the session, came twice a  week to see her. She played for him, and they talked on many subjects,  in which they discovered a common interest, usually avoiding politics,  of which he might reasonably be supposed to have enough on Capitol  Hill. He told her a good deal about himself, of his early  determination to go into public life, the interest that several  distinguished men in his State had taken in him, and of the influence  they had had on his mind.    
"They were almost demi-gods to my youthful enthusiasm," he said, "and  doubtless I exaggerated their virtues, estimable as is the record they  have left. But the ideals this conception of them set up in my mind I  have clung to as closely as I could, and whatever the trials of public  life--I will tell you more about them some day--the rewards are great  enough if no one can question your sense of public duty, if no  accusation of private interest or ignoble motive has ever been able to  stand on its feet after the usual nine days' babble."    
"Would you sacrifice yourself absolutely to your country?" asked  Betty, who kept him to the subject of himself as long as she could.    
He laughed. "That is not a fair question to ask any man, for an  affirmative makes a prig of him and a negative a mere politician. I  will therefore generalize freely and tell you that a man who believes  himself to be a statesman considers the nation first, as a matter of  course. Howard, for instance, nearly killed himself at the end of last  session over a measure which was of great national importance. He  should have been in his bed, and he worked day and night. But although  it was touch and go with him afterward, it was no more than he should  have done, for almost everything depends on the Chairman of a  Committee; and as Howard is a man of enormous personal influence and  knows more about the subject than any man in Congress, he dared not  resign in favour of any one. And yet he is accused of being hand-in-  glove with one of the greatest moneyed interests in the country."    
"Is he?" asked Betty, pointedly.    
"Those are accusations that it is almost impossible to prove. Howard  is a rich man, and his wealth is derived from the principal industry  of his State, which is unquestionably monopolized by a Trust. It would  be his duty to look after it in Congress in any case, as it is his  State's great source of wealth; so it is hard to tell. It does not  interfere with his being one of the ablest legislators and hardest  workers in the Senate--and over matters from which he can derive no  possible gain. But the suspicion will lower his position in the  history of the Senate."    
"Does any one know the truth about the Senate? Even Bryce says it is  impossible to get at it, the country is so prone to exaggeration; but  estimates that one-fifth of the Senate is corrupt."    
"No one knows. The whole point is this: the Senate is the worst place  in the world for a weak man, and there are weak men in it. A  Senatorship is the highest honour to-day in the gift of the Republic;  therefore ambitious men strive for it. A man no sooner achieves this  ambition than he finds himself beset by many temptations. He is  tormented by lobbyists who will never let him alone until he has  proved himself to be a man of incorruptible character and iron will;  and that takes time. He also finds that the Senate is a sort of  aristocracy, the more so as many of its members are rich men and live  well. If he never wanted money before, he wants it then, and if he  does not, his wife and daughters do. Then, if he is weak, he finds his  way into the pocket of some Trust Company or Railroad Corporation, and  his desire for re-election--to retain his brilliant position--  multiplies his shackles; for if he proves himself useful, the Trust  will buy his Legislature--if it happens to be venal--and keep him in  his place. But these instances I know must be rare, for I know the  personal character of every man in the Senate. One Senator who is  nearing the end of his first term told me the other day that he should  not return, for his experience in the Senate had given him such a keen  desire to be a rich man that he should go into Wall Street and try to  make a fortune. He is honest, but his patriotism is a poor affair. But  if the Senate makes a weak man weaker, it makes a strong man stronger,  owing to the very temptations he must resist from the day he enters,  the compromises he is forced to make, and the danger to his  convictions from the subtler brains of older men. And the Senate is  full of strong men. But they don't make picturesque 'copy' for the  enterprising press; the weak and the corrupt do, and so much space is  given them, as well as so much attention by the comic weeklies,--which  are regarded as a sort of current history,--that the average man, who  does not do his own thinking, accepts the minority as the type."    
He talked to her sometimes about his family life. His wife had been a  beautiful and accomplished girl, the daughter of a Governor of his  State, and he had married her when he was twenty-four. She had been a  great help to him, both at home and in Washington, during those years  when he needed help. She had not broken down until after the birth of  his daughter, but that was twenty years ago, and she had been an  invalid ever since. He spoke of this long period of imperfect  happiness in a matter-of-fact way, and Betty assumed that by this time  he was used to it. He alluded to his wife once as "a very dear old  friend," but Betty guessed that she was nearly obliterated from his  life. Of his sons he expected great things, but the larger measure of  his affections had been given to his daughter, or it seemed so, now  that he had lost her.    
During the last week of the Session she saw him from the Senate  Gallery only, but she consoled herself by admiring the cool  deliberation with which he worked his bills through, with Populists  thundering on either side of him.
