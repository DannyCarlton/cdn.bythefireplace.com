  Robert spent more days in New York, and they were all pleasant. His  own handsome face and winning manner would have made his way anywhere,  but it became known universally that a great interest was taken in him  by Mr. Benjamin Hardy, who was a great figure in the city, a man not to  be turned lightly into an enemy. It also seemed that some mystery  enveloped him&#8212;mystery always attracts&#8212;and the lofty and noble figure  of the young Onondaga, who was nearly always by his side, heightened  the romantic charm he had for all those with whom he came in contact.  Both Hardy and Willet urged him to go wherever he was asked by the  great, and clothes fitted to such occasions were provided promptly.
  &#8220;I am not able to pay for these,&#8221; said Robert to Willet when he was  being measured for the first of his fine raiment.
  &#8220;Don't trouble yourself about it,&#8221; said the hunter, smiling, &#8220;I have  sufficient to meet the bills, and I shall see that all your tailors are  reimbursed duly. Some one must always look after a man of fashion.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish I knew more than I do,&#8221; said Robert in troubled tones,  &#8220;because I've a notion that the money with which you will pay my tailor  comes from the till of Master Benjamin Hardy. It's uncommon strange  that he does so much for me. I'm very grateful, but surely there must  be some motive behind it.&#8221;
  He glanced at Willet to see how he took his words, but the hunter  merely smiled, and Robert knew that the smile was a mask through which  he could not penetrate.
  &#8220;Take the goods the gods provide thee,&#8221; said the hunter.
  &#8220;I will,&#8221; said Robert, cheerfully, &#8220;since it seems I can't do  anything else.&#8221;
  And he did. His response to New York continued to be as vigorous as  it had been to Quebec, and while New York lacked some of the  brilliancy, some of the ultimate finish that, to his mind, had  distinguished Quebec, it was more solid, there was more of an  atmosphere of resource, and it was all vastly interesting. Charteris  proved himself a right true friend, and he opened for him whatever  doors he cared to enter that Mr. Hardy may have left unlocked. He was  also thrown much with Grosvenor, and the instinctive friendship between  the two ripened fast.
  On the fifth day of his stay in New York a letter came out of the  wilderness from Wilton at Fort Refuge. It had been brought by an Oneida  runner to Albany, and was sent thence by post to New York.
  Wilton wrote that time would pass rather heavily with them in the  little fortress, if the hostile Indians allowed it. Small bands now  infested that region, and the soldiers were continually making marches  against them. The strange man, whom they called Black Rifle, was of  vast help, guiding them and saving them from ambush.
  Wilton wrote that he missed Philadelphia, which was certainly the  finest city outside of Europe, but he hoped to go back to it, seasoned  and improved by life in the woods. New York, where he supposed Robert  now to be, was an attractive town, in truth, a great port, but it had  not the wealth and cultivation of Philadelphia, as he hoped to show  Robert some day. Meanwhile he wished him well.
  Robert smiled. He had pleasant memories of Wilton, Colden, Carson  and the others, and while he was making new friends he did not commit  the crime of forgetting old ones. It was his hope that he should meet  them all again, not merely after the war, but long before.
  In his comings and goings among the great of their day Robert kept a  keen eye for the vision of St. Luc. He half hoped, half feared that  some time in the twilight or the full dusk of the night he would see in  some narrow street the tall figure wrapped in its great cloak. But the  chevalier did not appear, and Robert felt that he had not really come  as a spy upon the English army and its preparations. He must have gone,  days since.
  He met Adrian Van Zoon three times, that is, he was in the same room  with him, although they spoke together only once. The merchant had in  his presence an air of detachment. He seemed to be one who continually  carried a burden, and a stripling just from the woods could not long  have a place, either favorable or unfavorable, in his memory. Robert  began to wonder if St. Luc had net been mistaken. What could a man born  and bred in France, and only in recent years an inhabitant of Canada,  know of Adrian Van Zoon of New York? What, above all, could he know  that would cause him to warn Robert against him? But this, like all his  other questions, disappeared in the enjoyments of the moment. Nature,  which had been so kind in giving to him a vivid imagination, had also  given with it an intense appreciation. He liked nearly everything, and  nearly everybody, he could see a rosy mist where the ordinary man saw  only a cloud, and just now New York was so kind to him that he loved it  all.
  A week in the city and he attended a brilliant ball given by William  Walton in the Walton mansion, in Franklin Square, then the most  elaborate and costly home in North America. It was like a great English  country house, with massive brick walls and woodwork, all imported and  beautifully carved. The staircase in particular made of dark ebony was  the wonder of its day, and, in truth, the whole interior was like that  of a palace, instead of a private residence, at that time, in America.
  Robert enjoyed himself hugely. He realized anew how close was the  blood relationship among all those important families, and he was  already familiar with their names. The powerful sponsorship of Mr.  Hardy had caused them to take him in as one of their number, and for  that reason he liked them all the more. He was worldly wise enough  already to know that we are more apt to call a social circle snobbish  when we do not belong to it. Now, he was a welcome visitor at the best  houses in New York, and all was rose to him.
  Adrian Van Zoon, who had not only wealth but strong connections, was  there, but, as on recent occasions he took no notice of Robert, until  late in the evening when the guests were dancing the latest Paris and  London dances in the great drawing-room. Robert was resting for a  little space and as he leaned against the wall the merchant drew near  him and addressed him with much courtesy.
  &#8220;I fear, Mr. Lennox,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that I have spoken to you rather  brusquely, for which I offer many apologies. It was due, perhaps, to  the commercial rivalries of myself and Mr. Hardy, in whose house you  are staying. It was but natural for me to associate you with him.&#8221;
  &#8220;I wish to be linked with him,&#8221; said Robert, coldly. &#8220;I have a great  liking and respect for Mr. Hardy.&#8221;
  Mynheer Van Zoon laughed and seemed not at all offended.
  &#8220;The answer of a lad, and a proper one for a lad,&#8221; he said. &#8220;'Tis  well to be loyal to one's friends, and I must admit, too, that Mr.  Hardy is a man of many high qualities, a fact that a rivalry in  business extending over many years, has proved to me. He and I cannot  become friends, but I do respect him.&#8221;
  He had imparted some warmth to his tone, and his manner bore the  appearance of geniality. Robert, so susceptible to courtesy in others,  began to find him less repellent. He rejoined in the same polite  manner, and Mynheer Van Zoon talked to him a little while as a busy man  of middle age would speak to a youth. He asked him of his experiences  at Quebec, of which he had heard some rumor, and Robert, out of the  fullness of his mind, spoke freely on that subject.
  &#8220;Is it true,&#8221; asked Mynheer Van Zoon, &#8220;that David Willet in a duel  with swords slew a famous bravo?&#8221;
  &#8220;It's quite true,&#8221; replied Robert. &#8220;I was there, and saw it with my  own eyes. Pierre Boucher was the man's name, and never was a death more  deserved.&#8221;
  &#8220;Willet is a marvel with the sword.&#8221;
  &#8220;You knew him in his youth, Mynheer Van Zoon?&#8221;
  &#8220;I did not say that. It is possible that I was thinking of some one  who had talked to me about him. But, whatever thought may have been in  my mind, David Willet and I are not likely to tread the same path. I  repeat, Master Lennox, that although my manner may have seemed to you  somewhat brusque in the past, I wish you well. Do you remain much  longer in New York?&#8221;
  &#8220;Only a few days, I think.&#8221;
  &#8220;And you still find much of interest to see?&#8221;
  &#8220;Enough to occupy the remainder of my time. I wish to see a bit of  Long Island, but tomorrow I go to Paulus Hook to find one Nicholas  Suydam and to carry him a message from Colonel William Johnson, which  has but lately come to me in the post. I suppose it will be easy to get  passage across the Hudson.&#8221;
  &#8220;Plenty of watermen will take you for a fare, but if you are  familiar with the oars yourself it would be fine exercise for a strong  youth like you to row over and then back again.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's a good suggestion, as I do row, and I think I'll adopt it.&#8221;
  Mynheer Van Zoon passed on a moment or two later, and Robert, with  his extraordinary susceptibility to a friendly manner, felt a pleasant  impression. Surely St. Luc, who at least was an official enemy, did not  know the truth about Van Zoon! And if the Frenchman did happen to be  right, what did he have to fear in New York, surrounded by friends?
  The evening progressed, but Mynheer Van Zoon left early, and then in  the pleasures of the hour, surrounded by youth and brightness, Robert  forgot him, too. A banquet was served late, and there was such a  display of silver and gold plate that the British officers themselves  opened their eyes and later wrote letters to England, telling of the  amazing prosperity and wealth of New York, as proven by what they had  seen in the Walton and other houses.
  Robert did not go back to the home of Mr. Hardy, until a very late  hour, and he slept late the next day. When he rose he found that all  except himself had gone forth for one purpose or another, but it suited  his own plan well, as he could now take the letter of Colonel William  Johnson to his friend, Master Nicholas Suydam, in Paulus Hook. It was  another dark, gloomy day, but clouds and cold had little effect on his  spirits, and when he walked along the shore of the North River, looking  for a boat, he met the chaff of the watermen with humorous remarks of  his own. They discouraged his plan to row himself across, but being  proud of his skill he clung to it, and, having deposited two golden  guineas as security for its return, he selected a small but strong boat  and rowed into the stream.
  A sharp wind was blowing in from the sea, but he was able to manage  his little craft with ease, and, being used to rough water, he enjoyed  the rise and dip of the waves. A third of the way out and he paused and  looked back at New York, the steeple of St. George's showing above the  line of houses. He could distinguish from the mass other buildings that  he knew, and his heart suddenly swelled with affection for this town,  in which he had received such a warm welcome. He would certainly live  here, when the wars were over, and he could settle down to his career.
  Then he turned his eyes to the inner bay, where he saw the usual  amount of shipping, sloops, schooners, brigs and every other kind of  vessel known to the times. Behind them rose the high wooded shores of  Staten Island, and through the channel between it and Long Island  Robert saw other ships coming in. Truly, it was a noble bay, apparently  made for the creation of a great port, and already busy man was putting  it to its appointed use. Then he looked up the Hudson at the lofty  Palisades, the precipitous shores facing them, and his eyes came back  to the stream. Several vessels under full sail were steering for the  mouth of the Hudson, but he looked longest at a schooner, painted a  dark color, and very trim in her lines. He saw two men standing on her  decks, and two or three others visible in her rigging.
  Evidently she was a neat and speedy craft, but he was not there to  waste his time looking at schooners. The letter of Colonel William  Johnson to Master Nicholas Suydam in Paulus Hook must be delivered,  and, taking up his oars, he rowed vigorously toward the hamlet on the  Jersey shore.
  When he was about two-thirds of the way across he paused to look  back again, but the air was so heavy with wintry mists that New York  did not show at all. He was about to resume the oars once more when the  sound of creaking cordage caused him to look northward. Then he shouted  in alarm. The dark schooner was bearing down directly upon him, and was  coming very swiftly. A man on the deck whom he took to be the captain  shouted at him, but when Robert, pulling hard, shot his boat ahead, it  seemed to him that the schooner changed her course also.
  It was the last impression he had of the incident, as the prow of  the schooner struck his boat and clove it in twain. He jumped  instinctively, but his head received a glancing blow, and he did not  remember anything more until he awoke in a very dark and close place.  His head ached abominably, and when he strove to raise a hand to it he  found that he could not do so. He thought at first that it was due to  weakness, a sort of temporary paralysis, coming from the blow that he  dimly remembered, but he realized presently that his hands were bound,  tied tightly to his sides.
  He moved his body a little, and it struck against wood on either  side. His feet also were bound, and he became conscious of a swaying  motion. He was in a ship's bunk and he was a prisoner of somebody. He  was filled with a fierce and consuming rage. He had no doubt that he  was on the schooner that had run him down, nor did he doubt either that  he had been run down purposely. Then he lay still and by long staring  was able to make out a low swaying roof above him and very narrow  walls. It was a strait, confined place, and it was certainly deep down  in the schooner's hold. A feeling of horrible despair seized him. The  darkness, his aching head, and his bound hands and feet filled him with  the worst forebodings. Nor did he have any way of estimating time. He  might have been lying in the bunk at least a week, and he might now be  far out at sea.
  In misfortune, the intelligent and imaginative suffer most because  they see and feel everything, and also foresee further misfortunes to  come. Robert's present position brought to him in a glittering train  all that he had lost. Having a keen social sense his life in New York  had been one of continuing charm. Now the balls and receptions that he  had attended at great houses came back to him, even more brilliant and  vivid than their original colors had been. He remembered the many  beautiful women he had seen, in their dresses of silk or satin, with  their rosy faces and powdered hair, and the great merchants and feudal  landowners, and the British and American officers in their bright new  uniforms, talking proudly of the honors they expected to win.
  Then that splendid dream was gone, vanishing like a mist before a  wind, and he was back in the swaying darkness of the bunk, hands and  feet bound, and head aching. All things are relative. He felt now if  only the cruel cords were taken off his wrists and ankles he could be  happy. Then he would be able to sit up, move his limbs, and his head  would stop aching. He called all the powers of his will to his aid.  Since he could not move he would not cause himself any increase of pain  by striving to do so. He commanded his body to lie still and compose  itself and it obeyed. In a little while his head ceased to ache so  fiercely, and the cords did not bite so deep.
  Then he took thought. He was still sure that he was on board the  schooner that had run him down. He remembered the warning of St. Luc  against Adrian Van Zoon, and Adrian Van Zoon's suggestion that he row  his own boat across to Paulus Hook. But it seemed incredible. A  merchant, a rich man of high standing in New York, could not plan his  murder. Where was the motive? And, if such a motive did exist, a man of  Van Zoon's standing could not afford to take so great a risk. In spite  of St. Luc and his faith in him he dismissed it as an impossibility. If  Van Zoon had wished his death he would not have been taken out of the  river. He must seek elsewhere the reason of his present state.
  He listened attentively, and it seemed to him that the creaking and  groaning of the cordage increased. Once or twice he thought he heard  footsteps over his head, but he concluded that it was merely the  imagination. Then, after an interminable period of waiting, the door to  the room opened and a man carrying a ship's lantern entered, followed  closely by another. Robert was able to turn on his side and stare at  them.
  The one who carried the lantern was short, very dark, and had gold  rings in his ears. Robert judged him to be a Portuguese. But his  attention quickly passed to the man behind him, who was much taller,  rather spare, his face clean shaven, his hard blue eyes set close  together. Robert knew instinctively that he was master of the ship.
  &#8220;Hold up the lantern, Miguel,&#8221; the tall man said, &#8220;and let's have a  look at him.&#8221;
  The Portuguese obeyed.
  Then Robert felt the hard blue eyes fastened upon him, but he raised  himself as much as he could and gave back the gaze fearlessly.
  &#8220;Well, how's our sailorman?&#8221; said the captain, laughing, and his  laughter was hideous to the prisoner.
  &#8220;I don't understand you,&#8221; said Robert.
  &#8220;My meaning is plain enough, I take it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I demand that you set me free at once and restore me to my friends  in New York.&#8221;
  The tall man laughed until he held his sides, and the short man  laughed with him, laugh for laugh. Their laughter so filled Robert with  loathing and hate that he would have attacked them both had he been  unbound.
  &#8220;Come now, Peter,&#8221; said the captain at last. &#8220;Enough of your grand  manner. You carry it well for a common sailor, and old Nick himself  knows where you got your fine clothes, but here you are back among your  old comrades, and you ought to be glad to see 'em.&#8221;
  &#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; asked the astonished Robert.
  &#8220;Now, don't look so surprised. You can keep up a play too long. You  know as well as we do that you're plain Peter Smith, an able young  sailorman, when you're willing, who deserted us in Baltimore three  months ago, and you with a year yet to serve. And here's your  particular comrade, Miguel, so glad to see you. When we ran your boat  down, all your own fault, too, Miguel jumped overboard, and he didn't  dream that the lad he was risking his life to save was his old chum.  Oh, 'twas a pretty reunion! And now, Peter, thank Miguel for bringing  you back to life and to us.&#8221;
  A singular spirit seized Robert. He saw that he was at the mercy of  these men, who utterly without scruple wished for some reason to hold  him. He could be a player too, and perhaps more was to be won by being  a player.
  &#8220;I'm sorry,&#8221; he said, &#8220;but I was tempted by the follies of the land,  and I've had enough of 'em. If you'll overlook it and let the past be  buried, captain, you'll have no better seaman than Peter Smith. You've  always been a just but kind man, and so I throw myself on your mercy.&#8221;
  The captain and Miguel exchanged astonished glances.
  &#8220;I know you'll do it, captain,&#8221; Robert went on in his most winning  tones, &#8220;because, as I've just said, you've always been a kind man,  especially kind to me. I suppose when I first signed with you that I  was as ignorant and awkward a land lubber as you ever saw. But your  patient teaching has made me a real sailor. Release me now, and I think  that in a few hours I will be fit to go to work again.&#8221;
  &#8220;Cut the lashings, Miguel,&#8221; said the captain.
  Miguel's sharp knife quickly severed them, and Robert sat up in the  bunk. When the blood began to flow freely in the veins, cut off  hitherto, he felt stinging pains at first, but presently heavenly  relief came. The captain and Miguel stood looking at him.
  &#8220;Peter,&#8221; said the captain, &#8220;you were always a lad of spirit, and I'm  glad to get you back, particularly as we have such a long voyage ahead  of us. One doesn't go to the coast of Africa, gather a cargo of slaves  and get back in a day.&#8221;
  In spite of himself Robert could not repress a shudder of horror. A  slaver and he a prisoner on board her! He might be gone a year or more.  Never was a lad in worse case, but somewhere in him was a spark of hope  that refused to be extinguished. He gave a more imperious summons than  ever to his will, and it returned to his aid.
  &#8220;You've been kind to Peter Smith. Few captains would forgive what  I've done, but I'll try to make it up to you. How long are we out from  New York?&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;It might be an hour or it might be a day or what's more likely it  might be two days. You see, Peter, a lad who gets a crack on the head  like yours lies still and asleep for a long time. Besides, it don't  make any difference to you how long we've been out. So, just you stay  in your bunk a little while longer, and Miguel will bring you something  to eat and drink.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, captain. You're almost a father to me.&#8221;
  &#8220;That's a good lad, Peter. I am your father, I'm the father of all  my crew, and don't forget that a father sometimes has to punish his  children, so just you stay in your bunk till you're bid to come out of  it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, captain. I wouldn't think of disobeying you. Besides,  I'm too weak to move yet.&#8221;
  The captain and Miguel went out, and Robert heard them fastening the  door on the outside. Then the darkness shut him in again, and he lay  back in his bunk. The spark of hope somewhere in his mind had grown a  little larger. His head had ceased to ache and his limbs were free. The  physical difference made a mental difference yet greater. Although  there seemed to be absolutely no way out, he would find one.
  The door was opened again, and Miguel, bearing the ship's lantern in  one hand and a plate of food in the other, came in. It was rough food  such as was served on rough ships, but Robert sat up and looked at it  hungrily. Miguel grinned, and laughed until the gold hoops in his ears  shook.
  &#8220;You, Peter Smith,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Me terrible glad to see you again.  Miss my old comrade. Mourn for him, and then when find him jump into  the cold river to save him.&#8221;
  &#8220;It's true,&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;it was a long and painful parting, but  here we are, shipmates again. It was good of you, Miguel, to risk your  life to save me, and now that we've had so many polite interchanges,  suppose you save me from starving to death and pass that plate of  food.&#8221;
  &#8220;With ver' good will, Peter. Eat, eat with the great heartiness,  because we have ver', ver' hard work before us and for a long time. The  captain will want you to do as much work in t'ree mont' as t'ree men  do, so you can make up the t'ree mont' you have lost.&#8221;
  &#8220;Tell him I'm ready. I've already confessed all my sins to him.&#8221;
  &#8220;He won't let you work as sailor at first. He make you help me in  the cook's galley.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'm willing to do that too. You know I can cook. You'll remember,  Miguel, how I helped you in the Mediterranean, and how I did almost all  your work that time you were sick, when we were cruising down to the  Brazils?&#8221;
  Miguel grinned.
  &#8220;You have the great courage, you Peter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You always have.  Feel better now?&#8221;
  &#8220;A lot, Miguel. The bread was hard, I suppose, and better potatoes  have been grown, but I didn't notice the difference. That was good  water, too. I've always thought that water was a fine drink. And now,  Miguel, hunger and thirst being satisfied, I'll get up and stretch my  limbs a while. Then I'll be ready to go to work.&#8221;
  &#8220;I tell you when the captain wants you. Maybe an hour from now,  maybe two hours.&#8221;
  He took his lantern and the empty plate and withdrew, but Robert  heard him fastening the door on the outside again. Evidently they did  not yet wholly trust the good intentions of Peter Smith, the deserter,  whom they had recaptured in the Hudson. But the spark of hope lodged  somewhere in the mind of Peter Smith was still growing and glowing. The  removal of the bonds from his wrist and ankles had brought back a full  and free circulation, and the food and water had already restored  strength to one so young and strong. He stood up, flexed his muscles  and took deep breaths.
  He had no familiarity with the sea, but he was used to navigation in  canoes and boats on large and small lakes in the roughest kind of  weather, and the rocking of the schooner, which continued, did not make  him seasick, despite the close foul air of the little room in which he  was locked. He still heard the creaking of cordage and now he heard the  tumbling of waves too, indicating that the weather was rough. He tried  to judge by these sounds how fast the schooner was moving, but he could  make nothing of it. Then he strained his memory to see if he could  discover in any manner how long he had been on the vessel, but the  period of his unconsciousness remained a mystery, which he could not  unveil by a single second.
  Long stay in the room enabled him to penetrate its dusk a little,  and he saw that its light and air came in normal times from a single  small porthole, closed now. Nevertheless a few wisps of mist entered  the tiny crevices, and he inferred the vessel was in a heavy fog. He  was glad of it, because he believed the schooner would move slowly at  such a time, and anything that impeded the long African journey was to  his advantage.
  A period which seemed to be six hours but which he afterward knew to  be only one, passed, and his door swung back for the third time. The  face of Miguel appeared in the opening and again he grinned, until his  mouth formed a mighty slash across his face.
  &#8220;You come on deck now, you Peter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;captain wants you.&#8221;
  Robert's heart gave a mighty beat. Only those who have been shut up  in the dark know what it is to come out into the light. That alone was  sufficient to give him a fresh store of courage and hope. So he  followed Miguel up a narrow ladder and emerged upon the deck. As he had  inferred, the schooner was in a heavy fog, with scarcely any wind and  the sails hanging dead.
  The captain stood near the mast, gazing into the fog. He looked  taller and more evil than ever, and Robert saw the outline of a pistol  beneath his heavy pea jacket. Several other men of various  nationalities stood about the deck, and they gave Robert malicious  smiles. Forward he saw a twelve pound brass cannon, a deadly and  dangerous looking piece. It was extremely cold on deck, too, the raw  fog seeming to be so much liquid ice, but, though Robert shivered, he  liked it. Any kind of fresh air was heaven after that stuffy little  cabin.
  &#8220;How are you feeling, Peter?&#8221; asked the captain, although there was  no note of sympathy in his voice.
  &#8220;Very well, sir, thank you,&#8221; replied Robert, &#8220;and again I wish to  make my apologies for deserting, but the temptations of New York are  very strong, sir. The city went to my head.&#8221;
  &#8220;So it seems. We missed you on the voyage to Boston and back, but we  have you now. Doubtless Miguel has told you that you are to help him a  couple of days in his galley, and you'll stay there close. If you come  out before I give the word it's a belaying pin for you. But when I do  give the word you'll go back to your work as one of the cleverest  sailormen I ever had. You'll remember how you used to go out on the  spars in the iciest and slipperiest weather. None so clever at it as  you, Peter, and I'll soon see that you have the chance to show again to  all the men that you're the best sailor aboard ship.&#8221;
  Robert shivered mentally. He divined the plan of this villain, who  would send him in the icy rigging to sure death. He, an untrained  sailor, could not keep his footing there in a storm, and it could be  said that it was an accident, as it would be in the fulfilment though  not in the intent. But he divined something else that stopped the  mental shudder and that gave him renewed hope. Why should the captain  threaten him with a belaying pin if he did not stay in the cook's  galley for two days? To Robert's mind but one reason appeared, and it  was the fear that he should be seen on deck. And that fear existed  because they were yet close to land. It was all so clear to him that he  never doubted and again his heart leaped. He was bareheaded, but he  touched the place where his cap brim should have been and replied:
  &#8220;I'll remember, captain.&#8221;
  &#8220;See that you do,&#8221; said the man in level tones, instinct  nevertheless with hardness and cruelty.
  Robert touched his forehead again and turned away with Miguel,  descending to the cook's galley, resolved upon some daring trial, he  did not yet know what. Here the Portuguese set him to work at once,  scouring pots and kettles and pans, and he toiled without complaint  until his arms ached. Miguel at last began to talk. He seemed to suffer  from the lack of companionship, and Robert divined that he was the only  Portuguese on board.
  &#8220;Good helper, you Peter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It no light job to cook for  twenty men, and all of them hungry all the time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Have we our full crew on board, Miguel?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, twenty men and four more, and plenty guns, plenty powder and  ball. Fine cannon, too.&#8221;
  Robert judged that the slaver would be well armed and well manned,  but he decided to ask no more questions at present, fearing to arouse  the suspicions of Miguel, and he worked on with shut lips. The  Portuguese himself talked&#8212;it seemed that he had to do so, as the  longing for companionship overcame him&#8212;but he did not tell the name of  the schooner or its captain. He merely chattered of former voyages and  of the ports he had been in, invariably addressing his helper as Peter,  and speaking of him as if he had been his comrade.
  Robert, while apparently absorbed in his tasks, listened attentively  to all that he might hear from above He knew that the fog was as thick  as ever, and that the ship was merely moving up and down with the  swells. She might be anchored in comparatively shallow water. Now he  was absolutely sure that they were somewhere near the coast, and the  coast meant hope and a chance.
  Dinner, rude but plentiful, was served for the sailors and food  somewhat more delicate for the captain in his cabin.
  Robert himself attended to the captain, and he could see enough now  to know that the dark had come. He inferred there would be no objection  to his going upon deck in the night, but he made no such suggestion.  Instead he waited upon the tall man with a care and deftness that made  that somber master grin.
  &#8220;I believe absence has really improved you, Peter,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I  haven't been waited on so well in a long time.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, sir,&#8221; said Robert.
  Secretly he was burning with humiliation. It hurt his pride terribly  to serve a rough sea captain in such a manner, but he had no choice and  he resolved that if the chance came he would pay the debt. When the  dinner or supper, whichever it might be called, was over, he went back  to the galley and cheerfully began to clear away, and to wash and wipe  dishes. Miguel gave him a compliment, saying that he had improved since  their latest voyage and Robert thanked him duly.
  When all the work was done he crawled into a bunk just over the  cook's and in any other situation would have fallen asleep at once. But  his nerves were on edge, and he was not sleepy in the least. Miguel,  without taking off his clothes, lay down in the bunk beneath him, and  Robert soon heard him snoring. He also heard new sounds from above, a  whistle and a shriek and a roar combined that he did not recognize at  first, but which a little thought told him to be a growing wind and the  crash of the waves. The schooner began to dip and rise violently. He  was dizzy for a little while, but he soon recovered. A storm! The  knowledge gave him pleasure. He did not know why, but he felt that it,  too, contributed hope and a chance.
  The roar of the storm increased, but Miguel, who had probably spent  nearly all his life at sea, continued to sleep soundly. Robert was  never in his life more thoroughly awake.
  He sat up in his bunk, and now and then he heard the sound of voices  and of footsteps overhead, but soon they were lost entirely in the  incessant shrieking of the wind and the continuous thunder of the great  waves against the side of the schooner. In truth, it was a storm, one  of great fury. He knew that the ship although stripped to the utmost,  must be driving fast, but in what direction he had no idea. He would  have given much to know.
  The tumult grew and by and by he heard orders shouted through a  trumpet. He could stand it no longer, and, leaping down, he seized the  Portuguese by the shoulder and shook him.
  &#8220;Up, Miguel,&#8221; he cried. &#8220;A great storm is upon us!&#8221;
  The cook opened his eyes sleepily, and then sprang up, a look of  alarm on his face. While the eyes of the Portuguese were filled with  fear, he also seemed to be in a daze. It was apparent to Robert that he  was a heavy sleeper, and his long black hair falling about his forehead  he stared wildly. His aspect made an appeal to Robert's sense of humor,  even in those tense moments.
  &#8220;My judgment tells me, Miguel,&#8221; he shouted&#8212;he was compelled to  raise his voice to a high pitch owing to the tremendous clatter  overhead&#8212;&#8220;that there is a great storm, and the schooner is in danger!  And you know, too, that your old comrade, Peter Smith, who has sailed  the seas with you so long, is likely to be right in his opinions!&#8221;
  The gaze of Miguel became less wild, but he looked at Robert with  awe and then with superstition.
  &#8220;You have brought us bad luck,&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;An evil day for us  when you came aboard.&#8221;
  Robert laughed. A fanciful humor seized him.
  &#8220;But this is my place,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I, Peter Smith, belong on board  this schooner and you know, Miguel, that you and the captain insisted  on my coming back.&#8221;
  &#8220;We go on deck!&#8221; cried the cook, now thoroughly alarmed by the  uproar, which always increased. He rushed up the ladder and Robert  followed him, to be blown completely off his feet when he reached the  deck. But he snatched at the woodwork, held fast, and regained an  upright position. The captain stood not far away, holding to a rope,  but he was so deeply engrossed in directing his men that he paid no  attention to Robert.
  The youth cleared the mist and spray from his eyes and took a  comprehensive look. The aspect of sea and sky was enough to strike  almost any one with terror, but upon this occasion he was an exception.  He had never looked upon a wilder world, but in its very wildness lay  his hope. The icy spars from which he would slip to plunge to his death  in the chilling sea were gone, and so was far Africa, and the slaver's  hunt. He was not a seaman, his experience had been with lakes, but one  could reason from lakes to the universal ocean, and he knew that the  schooner was in a fight for life. And involved in it was his fight for  freedom.
  The wind, cold as death, and sharp as a sword, blew out of the  northeast, and the schooner, heeled far over, was driving fast before  it, in spite of every effort of a capable captain and crew. The ship  rose and fell violently with the huge swells, and water that stung like  an icy sleet swept over her continually. Looking to the westward Robert  saw something that caused his heart to throb violently. It was a dim  low line, but he knew it to be land.
  What land it was he had no idea, nor did he at the moment care, but  there lay freedom. Rows of breakers opening their strong teeth for the  ship might stretch between, but better the breakers than the slaver's  deck and the man hunt in the slimy African lagoons. For him the icy  wind was the breath of life, and he soon ceased to shiver. But he  became conscious of chattering teeth near him and he saw Miguel, his  face a reproduction of terror in all its aspects.
  &#8220;We go!&#8221; shouted the Portuguese. &#8220;The storm drive the ship on the  breakers and she break to pieces, and all of us lost!&#8221;
  Robert's fantastic spirit was again strong upon him.
  &#8220;Then let us go!&#8221; he shouted back. &#8220;Better this clean, cold coast  than the fever swamps of Africa! Hold fast, Miguel, and we'll ride in  together!&#8221;
  The superstitious awe of the Portuguese deepened, and he drew away  from Robert. In the moment of terrible storm and approaching death this  could be no mortal youth who showed not fear, but instead a joy that  was near to exaltation. Then and there he was convinced that when they  had seized him and brought him aboard they had made their own doom  certain.
  &#8220;In twenty minutes, we strike!&#8221; cried Miguel. &#8220;Ah, how the wind  rise! Many a year since I see such a storm!&#8221;
  Spars snapped and were carried away in the foaming sea. Then the  mast went, and the crew began to launch the boats. Robert rushed to the  captain's cabin. When he served the man there he had not failed to  observe what the room contained, and now he snatched from the wall a  huge greatcoat, a belt containing a brace of pistols in a holster with  ammunition, and a small sword. He did not know why he took the sword,  but it was probably some trick of the fancy and he buckled it on with  the rest. Then he returned to the deck, where he could barely hold his  footing, the schooner had heeled so far over, and so powerful was the  wind and the driving of the spray. One of the boats had been launched  under the command of the second mate, but she was overturned almost  instantly, and all on board her were lost. Robert was just in time to  see a head bob once or twice on the surface of the sea, and then  disappear.
  A second boat commanded by the first mate was lowered and seven or  eight men managed to get into it, rowing with all their might toward an  opening that appeared in the white line of foam. A third which could  take the remainder of the crew was made ready and the captain himself  would be in charge of it.
  It was launched successfully and the men dropped into it, one by  one, but very fast. Miguel swung down and into a place. Robert advanced  for the same purpose, but the captain, who was still poised on the rail  of the ship, took notice of him for the first time.
  &#8220;No! No, Peter!&#8221; he shouted, and even in the roar of the wind Robert  observed the grim humor in his voice. &#8220;You've been a good and faithful  sailorman, and we leave you in charge of the ship! It's a great  promotion and honor for you, Peter, but you deserve it! Handle her well  because she's a good schooner and answers kindly to a kind hand! Now,  farewell, Peter, and a long and happy voyage to you!&#8221;
  A leveled pistol enforced his command to stop, and the next moment  he slid down a rope and into the boat. A sailor cut the rope and they  pulled quickly away, leaving Robert alone on the schooner. His  exultation turned to despair for a moment, and then his courage came  back. Tayoga in his place would not give up. He would pray to his  Manitou, who was Robert's God, and put complete faith in His wisdom and  mercy. Moreover, he was quit of all that hateful crew. The ship of the  slavers was beneath his feet, but the slavers themselves were gone.
  As he looked, he saw the second boat overturn, and he thought he  heard the wild cry of those about to be lost, but he felt neither pity  nor sympathy. A stern God, stern to such as they, had called them to  account. The captain's boat had disappeared in the mist and spray.
  Robert, with the huge greatcoat wrapped about him clung to the stump  of the mast, which long since had been blown overboard, and watched the  white line of the breakers rapidly coming nearer, as they reached out  their teeth for the schooner. He knew that he could do nothing more for  himself until the ship struck. Then, with some happy chance aiding him,  he would drop into the sea and make a desperate try for the land. He  would throw off the greatcoat when he leaped, but meanwhile he kept it  on, because one would freeze without it in the icy wind.
  He heard presently the roaring of the breakers mingled with the  roaring of the wind, and, shutting his eyes, he prayed for a miracle.
  He felt the foam beating upon his face, and believing it must come  from the rocks, he clung with all his might to the stump of the mast,  because the shock must occur within a few moments. He felt the schooner  shivering under him, and rising and falling heavily, and then he opened  his eyes to see where best to leap when the shock did come.
  He beheld the thick white foam to right and left, but he had not  prayed in vain. The miracle had happened. Here was a narrow opening in  the breakers, and, with but one chance in a hundred to guide it, the  schooner had driven directly through, ceasing almost at once to rock so  violently. But there was enough power left in the waves even behind the  rocks to send the schooner upon a sandy beach, where she must soon  break up.
  But Robert was saved. He knew it and he murmured devout thanks. When  the schooner struck in the sand he was thrown roughly forward, but he  managed to regain his feet for an instant, and he leaped outward as far  as he could, forgetting to take off his greatcoat. A returning wave  threw him down and passed over his head, but exerting all his will, and  all his strength he rose when it had passed, and ran for the land as  hard as he could. The wave returned, picked him up, and hurried him on  his way. When it started back again its force was too much spent and  the water was too shallow to have much effect on Robert. He continued  running through the yielding sand, and, when the wave came in again and  snatched at him, it was not able to touch his feet.
  He reached weeds, then bushes, and clutched them with both hands,  lest some wave higher and more daring than all the rest should yet come  for him and seize him. But, in a moment, he let them go, knowing that  he was safe, and laughing rather giddily, sank down in a faint.
