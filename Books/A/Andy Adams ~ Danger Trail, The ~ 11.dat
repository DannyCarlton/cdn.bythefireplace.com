  Half-way down the ridge a low word from Croisset stopped the  engineer. Jean had toggled his team with a stout length of babeesh on  the mountain top and he was looking back when Howland turned toward  him. The sharp edge of that part of the mountain from which they were  descending stood out in a clear-cut line against the sky, and on this  edge the six dogs of the team sat squat on their haunches, silent and  motionless, like strangely carved gargoyles placed there to guard the  limitless plains below. Howland took his pipe from his mouth as he  watched the staring interest of Croisset. From the man he looked up  again at the dogs. There was something in their sphynx-like attitude,  in the moveless reaching of their muzzles out into the wonderful  starlit mystery of the still night that filled him with an indefinable  sense of awe. Then there came to his ears the sound that had stopped  Croisset&#8212;a low, moaning whine which seemed to have neither beginning  nor end, but which was borne in on his senses as though it were a part  of the soft movement of the air he breathed&#8212;a note of infinite sadness  which held him startled and without movement, as it held Jean Croisset.  And just as he thought that the thing had died away, the wailing came  again, rising higher and higher, until at last there rose over him a  single long howl that chilled the blood to his very marrow. It was like  the wolf-howl of that first night he had looked on the wilderness, and  yet unlike it; in the first it had been the cry of the savage, of  hunger, of the unending desolation of life that had thrilled him. In  this it was death. He stood shivering as Croisset came down to him, his  thin face shining white in the starlight. There was no other sound save  the excited beating of life in their own bodies when Jean spoke.
  &#8220;M'seur, our dogs howl like that only when some one is dead or about  to die,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;It was Woonga who gave the cry. He has lived  for eleven years and I have never known him to fail.&#8221;
  There was an uneasy gleam in his eyes.
  &#8220;I must tie your hands, M'seur.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I have given you my word, Jean&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Your hands, M'seur. There is already death below us in the plain,  or it is to come very soon. I must tie your hands.&#8221;
  Howland thrust his wrists behind him and about them Jean twisted a  thong of babeesh.
  &#8220;I believe I understand,&#8221; he spoke softly, listening again for the  chilling wail from the mountain top. &#8220;You are afraid that I will kill  you.&#8221;
  &#8220;It is a warning, M'seur. You might try. But I should probably kill  you. As it is&#8212;&#8221; he shrugged his shoulders as he led the way down the  ridge&#8212;&#8220;as it is, there is small chance of Jean Croisset answering the  call.&#8221;
  &#8220;May those saints of yours preserve me, Jean, but this is all very  cheerful!&#8221; grunted Howland, half laughing in spite of himself. &#8220;Now  that I'm tied up again, who the devil is there to die&#8212;but me?&#8221;
  &#8220;That is a hard question, M'seur,&#8221; replied the half-breed with grim  seriousness. &#8220;Perhaps it is your turn. I half believe that it is.&#8221;
  Scarcely were the words out of his mouth when there came again the  moaning howl from the top of the ridge.
  &#8220;You're getting on my nerves, Jean&#8212;you and that accursed dog!&#8221;
  &#8220;Silence, M'seur!&#8221;
  Out of the grim loneliness at the foot of the mountain there loomed  a shadow which at first Howland took to be a huge mass of rock. A few  steps farther and he saw that it was a building. Croisset gripped him  firmly by the arm.
  &#8220;Stay here,&#8221; he commanded. &#8220;I will return soon.&#8221;
  For a quarter of an hour Howland waited. Twice in that interval the  dog howled above him. He was glad when Croisset appeared out of the  gloom.
  &#8220;It is as I thought, M'seur. There is death down here. Come with  me!&#8221;
  The shadow of the big building shrouded them as they approached.  Howland could make out that it was built of massive logs and that there  seemed to be neither door nor window on their side. And yet when Jean  hesitated for an instant before a blotch of gloom that was deeper than  the others, he knew that they had come to an entrance. Croisset  advanced softly, sniffing the air suspiciously with his thin nostrils,  and listening, with Howland so close to him that their shoulders  touched. From the top of the mountain there came again the mournful  death-song of old Woonga, and Jean shivered. Howland stared into the  blotch of gloom, and still staring he followed Croisset&#8212;entered&#8212;and  disappeared in it. About them was the stillness and the damp smell of  desertion. There was no visible sign of life, no breathing, no movement  but their own, and yet Howland could feel the half-breed's hand clutch  him nervously by the arm as they went step by step into the black and  silent mystery of the place. Soon there came a fumbling of Croisset's  hand at a latch and they passed through a second door. Then Jean struck  a match.
  Half a dozen steps away was a table and on the table a lamp.  Croisset lighted it, and with a quiet laugh faced the engineer. They  were in a low, dungeon-like chamber, without a window and with but the  one door through which they had entered. The table, two chairs, a stove  and a bunk built against one of the log walls were all that Howland  could see. But it was not the barrenness of what he imagined was to be  his new prison that held his eyes in staring inquiry on Croisset. It  was the look in his companion's face, the yellow pallor of fear&#8212;a  horror&#8212;that had taken possession of it. The half-breed closed and  bolted the door, and then sat down beside the table, his thin face  peering up through the sickly lamp-glow at the engineer.
  &#8220;M'seur, it would be hard for you to guess where you are.&#8221;
  Howland waited.
  &#8220;If you had lived in this country long, M'seur, you would have heard  of<I> la Maison de Mort Rouge</I>&#8212;the House of the Red Death, as you  would call it. That is where we are&#8212;in the dungeon room. It is a  Hudson Bay post, abandoned almost since I can remember. When I was a  child the smallpox plague came this way and killed all the people.  Nineteen years ago the red plague came again, and not one lived through  it in this<I> Poste de Mort Rouge.</I> Since then it has been left to  the weasels and the owls. It is shunned by every living soul between  the Athabasca and the bay. That is why you are safe here.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ye gods!&#8221; breathed Howland. &#8220;Is there anything more, Croisset? Safe  from what, man? Safe from what?&#8221;
  &#8220;From those who wish to kill you, M'seur. You would not go into the  South, so<I> la belle</I> Meleese has compelled you to go into the  North,<I> Comprenez-vous?</I>&#8220;
  For a moment Howland sat as if stunned.
  &#8220;Do you understand, M'seur?&#8221; persisted Croisset, smiling.
  &#8220;I&#8212;I&#8212;think I do,&#8221; replied Howland tensely. &#8220;You mean&#8212;Meleese&#8212;&#8221;
  Jean took the words from him.
  &#8220;I mean that you would have died last night, M'seur, had it not been  for Meleese. You escaped from the coyote&#8212;but you would not have  escaped from the other. That is all I can tell you. But you will be  safe here. Those who seek your life will soon believe that you are  dead, and then we will let you go back. Is that not a kind fate for one  who deserves to be cut into bits and fed to the ravens?&#8221;
  &#8220;You will tell me nothing more, Jean?&#8221; the engineer asked.
  &#8220;Nothing&#8212;except that while I would like to kill you I have sympathy  for you. That, perhaps, is because I once lived in the South. For six  years I was with the company in Montreal, where I went to school.&#8221;
  He rose to his feet, tying the flap of his caribou skin coat about  his throat. Then he unbolted and opened the door. Faintly there came to  them, as if from a great distance, the wailing grief of Woonga, the  dog.
  &#8220;You said there was death here,&#8221; whispered Howland, leaning close to  his shoulder.
  &#8220;There is one who has lived here since the last plague,&#8221; replied  Croisset under his breath. &#8220;He lost his wife and children and it drove  him mad. That is why we came down so quietly. He lived in a little  cabin out there on the edge of the clearing, and when I went to it  to-night there was a sapling over the house with a flag at the end of  it. When the plague comes to us we hang out a red flag as a warning to  others. That is one of our laws. The flag is blown to tatters by the  winds. He is dead.&#8221;
  Howland shuddered.
  &#8220;Of the smallpox?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  For a few moments they stood in silence. Then Croisset added, &#8220;You  will remain here, M'seur, until I return.&#8221;
  He went out, closing and barring the door from the other side, and  Howland seated himself again in the chair beside the table. Fifteen  minutes later the half-breed returned, bearing with him a good-sized  pack and a two-gallon jug.
  &#8220;There is wood back of the stove, M'seur. Here is food and water for  a week, and furs for your bed. Now I will cut those thongs about your  wrists.&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you mean to say you're going to leave me here alone&#8212;in this  wretched prison?&#8221; cried Howland.
  &#8220;<I>Mon Dieu</I>, is it not better than a grave, M'seur? I will be  back at the end of a week.&#8221;
  The door was partly open and for the last time there came to  Howland's ears the mourning howl of the old dog on the mountain top.  Almost threateningly he gripped Croisset's arm.
  &#8220;Jean&#8212;if you don't come back&#8212;what will happen?&#8221;
  He heard the half-breed chuckling.
  &#8220;You will die, M'seur, pleasantly and taking your own time at it,  which is much better than dying over a case of dynamite. But I will  come back, M'seur. Good-by!&#8221;
  Again the door was closed and bolted and the sound of Croisset's  footsteps quickly died away beyond the log walls. Many minutes passed  before Howland thought of his pipe, or a fire. Then, shiveringly, he  went to seek the fuel which Jean had told him was behind the stove. The  old bay stove was soon roaring with the fire which he built, and as the  soothing fumes of his pipe impregnated the damp air of the room he  experienced a sensation of comfort which was in strange contrast to the  exciting happenings of the past few days.
  At last he was alone, with nothing to do for a week but eat, sleep  and smoke. He had plenty of tobacco and an inspection of the pack  showed that Croisset had left him well stocked with food. Tilted back  in a chair, with his feet on the table, he absorbed the cheerful heat  from the stove, sent up clouds of smoke, and wondered if the half-breed  had already started back into the South. What would MacDonald say when  Jackpine came in with the report that he had slipped to his death in  the waterfall? Probably his first move would be to send the most  powerful team on the Wekusko in pursuit of Gregson and Thorne. The  departing engineers would be compelled to return, and then&#8212;
  He laughed aloud and began pacing back and forth across the rotted  floor of his prison as he pictured the consternation of the two  seniors. And then a flush burned in his face and his eyes glowed as he  thought of Meleese. In spite of himself she had saved him from his  enemies, and he blessed Croisset for having told him the meaning of  this flight into the North. Once again she had betrayed him, but this  time it was to save his life, and his heart leaped in joyous faith at  this proof of her love for him. He believed that he understood the  whole scheme now. Even his enemies would think him dead. They would  leave the Wekusko and after a time, when it was safe for him to return,  he would be given his freedom.
  With the passing of the hours gloomier thoughts shadowed these  anticipations. In some mysterious way Meleese was closely associated  with those who sought his life, and if they disappeared she would  disappear with them. He was convinced of that. And then&#8212;could he find  her again? Would she go into the South&#8212;to civilization&#8212;or deeper into  the untraveled wildernesses of the North? In answer to his question  there flashed through his mind the words of Jean Croisset: &#8220;M'seur, I  know of a hundred men between Athabasca and the bay who would kill you  for what you have said.&#8221; Yes, she would go into the North. Somewhere in  that vast desolation of which Jean had spoken he would find her, even  though he spent half of his life in the search!
  It was past midnight when he spread out the furs and undressed for  bed. He opened the stove door and from the bunk watched the faint  flickerings of the dying firelight on the log walls. As slumber closed  his eyes he was conscious of a sound&#8212;the faint, hungerful, wailing cry  to which he had listened that first night near Prince Albert. It was a  wolf, and drowsily he wondered how he could hear the cry through the  thick log walls of his prison. The answer came to him the moment he  opened his eyes, hours later. A bit of pale sunlight was falling into  the room and he saw that it entered through a narrow aperture close up  to the ceiling. After he had prepared his breakfast he dragged the  table under this aperture and by standing on it was enabled to peer  through. A hundred yards away was the black edge of the spruce and  balsam forest. Between him and the forest, half smothered in the deep  snow, was a cabin, and he shuddered as he saw floating over it the  little red signal of death of which Croisset had told him the night  before.
  With the breaking of this day the hours seemed of interminable  length. For a time he amused himself by searching every corner and  crevice of his prison room, but he found nothing of interest beyond  what he had already discovered. He examined the door which Croisset had  barred on him, and gave up all hope of escape in that direction. He  could barely thrust his arm through the aperture that opened out on the  plague-stricken cabin. For the first time since the stirring beginning  of his adventures at Prince Albert a sickening sense of his own  impotency began to weigh on Howland. He was a prisoner&#8212;penned up in a  desolate room in the heart of a wilderness. And he, Jack Howland, a man  who had always taken pride in his physical prowess, had allowed one man  to place him there.
  His blood began to boil as he thought of it. Now, as he had time and  silence in which to look back on what had happened, he was enraged at  the pictures that flashed one after another before him. He had allowed  himself to be used as nothing more than a pawn in a strange and  mysterious game. It was not through his efforts alone that he had been  saved in the fight on the Saskatchewan trail. Blindly he had walked  into the trap at the coyote. Still more blindly he had allowed himself  to be led into the ambush at the Wekusko camp. And more like a child  than a man he had submitted himself to Jean Croisset!
  He stamped back and forth across the room, smoking viciously, and  his face grew red with the thoughts that were stirring venom within  him. He placed no weight on circumstances; in these moments he found no  excuse for himself. In no situation had he displayed the white feather,  at no time had he felt a thrill of fear. His courage and recklessness  had terrified Meleese, had astonished Croisset. And yet&#8212;what had he  done? From the beginning&#8212;from the moment he first placed his foot in  the Chinese cafe&#8212;his enemies had held the whip-hand. He had been  compelled to play a passive part. Up to the point of the ambush on the  Wekusko trail he might have found some vindication for himself. But  this experience with Jean Croisset&#8212;it was enough to madden him, now  that he was alone, to think about it. Why had<I> he</I> not taken  advantage of Jean, as Jackpine and the Frenchman had taken advantage of  him?
  He saw now what he might have done. Somewhere, not very far back,  the sledge carrying Meleese and Jackpine had turned into the unknown.  They two were alone. Why had he not made Croisset a prisoner, instead  of allowing himself to be caged up like a weakling? He swore aloud as  there dawned on him more and more a realization of the opportunity he  had lost. At the point of a gun he could have forced Croisset to  overtake the other sledge. He could have surprised Jackpine, as they  had surprised him on the trail. And then? He smiled, but there was no  humor in the smile. He at least would have held the whip-hand. And what  would Meleese have done?
  He asked himself question after question, answering them quickly and  decisively in the same breath. Meleese loved him. He would have staked  his life on that. His blood leaped as he felt again the thrill of her  kisses when she had come to him as he lay bound and gagged beside the  trail. She had taken his head in her arms, and through the grief of her  face he had seen shining the light of a great love that had glorified  it for all time for him. She loved him! And he had let her slip away  from him, had weakly surrendered himself at a moment when everything  that he had dreamed of might have been within his grasp. With Jackpine  and Croisset in his power&#8212;
  He went no further. Was it too late to do these things now? Croisset  would return. With a sort of satisfaction it occurred to him that his  actions had disarmed the Frenchman of suspicion. He believed that it  would be easy to overcome Croisset, to force him to follow in the trail  of Meleese and Jackpine. And that trail? It would probably lead to the  very stronghold of his enemies. But what of that? He loaded his pipe  again, puffing out clouds of smoke until the room was thick with it.  That trail would take him to Meleese&#8212;wherever she was. Heretofore his  enemies had come to him; now he would go to them. With Croisset in his  power, and with none of his enemies aware of his presence, everything  would be in his favor. He laughed aloud as a sudden thrilling thought  flashed into his mind. As a last resort he would use Jean as a decoy.
  He foresaw how easy it would be to bring Meleese to him&#8212;to see  Croisset. His own presence would be like the dropping of a bomb at her  feet. In that moment, when she saw what he was risking for her, that he  was determined to possess her, would she not surrender to the pleading  of his love? If not he would do the other thing&#8212;that which had brought  the joyous laugh to his lips. All was fair in war and love, and theirs  was a game of love. Because of her love for him Meleese had kidnapped  him from his post of duty, had sent him a prisoner to this death-house  in the wilderness. Love had exculpated her. That same love would  exculpate him. He would make her a prisoner, and Jean should drive them  back to the Wekusko. Meleese herself had set the pace and he would  follow it. And what woman, if she loved a man, would not surrender  after this? In their sledge trip he would have her to himself, for not  only an hour or two, but for days. Surely in that time he could win.  There would be pursuit, perhaps; he might have to fight&#8212;but he was  willing, and a trifle anxious, to fight.
  He went to bed that night, and dreamed of things that were to  happen. A second day, a third night, and a third day came. With each  hour grew his anxiety for Jean's return. At times he was almost  feverish to have the affair over with. He was confident of the outcome,  and yet he did not fail to take the Frenchman's true measurement. He  knew that Jean was like live wire and steel, as agile as a cat, more  than a match with himself in open fight despite his own superior weight  and size. He devised a dozen schemes for Jean's undoing. One was to  leap on him while he was eating; another to spring on him and choke him  into partial insensibility as he knelt beside his pack or fed the fire;  a third to strike a blow from behind that would render him powerless.  But there was something in this last that was repugnant to him. He  remembered that Jean had saved his life, that in no instance had he  given him physical pain. He would watch for an opportunity, take  advantage of the Frenchman, as Croisset had taken advantage of him, but  he would not hurt him seriously. It should be as fair a struggle as  Jean had offered him, and with the handicap in his favor the best man  would win.
  On the morning of the fourth day Howland was awakened by a sound  that came through the aperture in the wall. It was the sharp yelping  bark of a dog, followed an instant later by the sharper crack of a  whip, and a familiar voice.
  Jean Croisset had returned!
  With a single leap he was out of his bunk. Half dressed he darted to  the door, and crouched there, the muscles of his arms tightening, his  body tense with the gathering forces within him.
  The spur of the moment had driven him to quick decision. His  opportunity would come when Jean Croisset passed through that door!
