  Kent did not move. His senses for a space were stunned. He was   almost physically insensible to all emotions but that one of shock   and horror. He was staring at Kedsty's gray-white, twisted face  when  he heard Marette's door close. A cry came from his lips, but  he did  not hear it&#8212;was unconscious that he had made a sound. His  body shook  with a sudden tremor. He could not disbelieve, for the  evidence was  there. From behind, as he had sat in his chair  Marette Radisson had  struck the Inspector of Police with some  blunt object. The blow had  stunned him. And after that&#8212; 
  He drew a hand across his eyes, as if to clear his vision. What he   had seen was impossible. The evidence was impossible. Assaulted,  in  deadly peril, defending either honor or love, Marette Radisson  was of  the blood to kill. But to creep up behind her victim&#8212;it  was  inconceivable! Yet there had been no struggle. Even the  automatic on  the floor gave no evidence of that. Kent picked it  up. He looked at it  closely, and again the unconscious cry of  despair came in a half groan  from his lips. For on the butt of the  Colt was a stain of blood and a  few gray hairs. Kedsty had been  stunned by a blow from his own gun! 
  As Kent placed it on the table, his eyes caught suddenly a gleam   of steel under the edge of a newspaper, and he drew out from their   hiding-place the long-bladed clipping scissors which Kedsty had  used  in the preparation of his scrap-books and official reports.  It was the  last link in the deadly evidence&#8212;the automatic with  its telltale  stain, the scissors, the tress of hair, and Marette  Radisson. He felt  a sensation of sudden dizziness. Every nerve-  center in his body had  received its shock, and when the shock had  passed it left him  sweating. 
  Swiftly the reaction came. It was a lie, he told himself. The   evidence was false. Marette could not have committed that crime,  as  the crime had visualized itself before his eyes. There was  something  which he had not seen, something which he could not see,  something  that was hiding itself from him. He became, in an  instant, the old  James Kent. The instinctive processes of the man-  hunter leaped to  their stations like trained soldiers. He saw  Marette again, as she had  looked at him when he entered the room.  It was not murder he had  caught in her wide-open eyes. It was not  hatred. It was not madness.  It was a quivering, bleeding soul  crying out to him in an agony that  no other human eyes had ever  revealed to him before. And suddenly a  great voice cried out in  his brain, drowning all other things, telling  him how contemptible  a thing was love unless in that love was faith. 
  With his heart choking him, he turned again to Kedsty. The   futility of the thing which he had told himself was faith gripped  at  him sickeningly, yet he fought for that faith, even as his eyes  looked  again upon the ghastly torture that was in Kedsty's face. 
  He was becoming calmer. He touched the dead man's cheek and found   that it was no longer warm. The tragedy must have occurred an hour   before. He examined more closely the abrasion on Kedsty's  forehead.  It was not a deep wound, and the blow that had made it  must have  stunned the Inspector of Police for only a short time.  In that space  the other thing had happened. In spite of his almost  superhuman effort  to keep the picture away from him, Kent saw it  vividly&#8212;the swift  turning to the table, the inspiration of the  scissors, the clipping of  the long tress of hair, the choking to  death of Kedsty as he regained  consciousness. Over and over again  he whispered to himself the  impossibility of it, the absurdity of  it, the utter incongruity of it.  Only a brain gone mad would have  conceived that monstrous way of  killing Kedsty. And Marette was  not mad. She was sane. 
  Like the eyes of a hunting ferret his own eyes swept quickly about   the room. At the four windows there were long curtain cords. On  the  walls, hung there as trophies, were a number of weapons. On  one end of  Kedsty's desk, used as a paperweight, was a stone  tomahawk. Still  nearer to the dead man's hands, unhidden by  papers, was a boot-lace.  Under his limp right hand was the  automatic. With these possible  instruments of death close at hand,  ready to be snatched up without  trouble or waste of time, why had  the murderer used a tress of woman's  hair? 
  The boot-lace drew Kent's eyes. It was impossible not to see it,   forty-eight inches long and quarter-inch-wide buckskin. He began   seeking for its mate, and found it on the floor where Marette   Radisson had been standing. And again the unanswerable question   pounded in Kent's brain&#8212;why had Kedsty's murderer used a tress of   hair instead of a buckskin lace or one of the curtain cords  hanging  conspicuously at the windows? 
  He went to each of these windows and found them locked. Then, a   last time, he bent over Kedsty. He knew that in the final moments  of  his life Kedsty had suffered a slow and torturing agony. His  twisted  face left the story. And the Inspector of Police was a  powerful man.  He had struggled, still partly dazed by the blow.  But it had taken  strength to overcome him even then, to hold his  head back, to choke  life out of him slowly with the noose of hair.  And Kent, now that the  significance of what he saw began to grow  upon him more clearly, felt  triumphing over all other things in  his soul a slow and mighty joy. It  was inconceivable that with the  strength of her own hands and body  Marette Radisson had killed  Kedsty. A greater strength than hers had  held him in the death-  chair, and a greater strength than hers had  choked life from the  Inspector of Police! 
  He drew slowly out of the room, closing the door noiselessly   behind him. He found that the front door was as Kedsty had left  it,  unlocked. 
  Close to that door he stood for a space, scarcely allowing himself   to breathe. He listened, but no sound came down the dimly  illumined  stairway. 
  A new thing was pressing upon him now. It rode over the shock of   tragedy, over the first-roused instincts of the man-hunter,   overwhelming him with the realization of a horror such as had  never  confronted him before. It gripped him more fiercely than the  mere  killing of Kedsty. His thought was of Marette, of the fate  which dawn  and discovery would bring for her. His hands clenched  and his jaws  tightened. The world was against him, and tomorrow it  would be against  her. Only he, in the face of all that condemning  evidence in the room  beyond, would disbelieve her guilty of  Kedsty's death. And he, Jim  Kent, was already a murderer in the  eyes of the law. 
  He felt within him the slow-growing inspiration of a new spirit,   the gathering might of a new force. A few hours ago he was an   outcast. He was condemned. Life, for him, had been robbed of its  last  hope. And in that hour of his grimmest despair Marette  Radisson had  come to him. Through storm that had rocked the earth  under her feet  and set ablaze the chaotic blackness of the sky  over her head she had  struggled&#8212;for him. She had counted no cost.  She had measured no  chances. She had simply come&#8212;BECAUSE SHE  BELIEVED IN HIM. And now,  upstairs, she was the victim of the  terrible price that was the first  cost of his freedom. For he  believed, now that the thought came to him  like a dagger stroke,  that this was so. Her act in freeing him had  brought about the  final climax, and as a result of it, Kedsty was  dead. 
  He went to the foot of the stair. Quietly, in his shoeless feet,   he began to climb them. He wanted to cry out Marette's name even   before he came to the top. He wanted to reach up to her with his  arms  outstretched. But he came silently to her door and looked in. 
  She lay in a crumpled, huddled heap on her bed. Her face was   hidden, and all about her lay her smothering hair. For a moment he   was frightened. He could not see that she was breathing. So still  was  she that she was like one dead. 
  His footsteps were unheard as he moved across the room. He knelt   down beside her, reached out his arms, and gathered her into them. 
  &quot;Marette!&quot; he cried in a low voice. 
  He felt the sudden quiver, like a little shock, that ran through   her. He crushed his face down, so that it lay in her hair, still  damp  from its wetting. He drew her closer, tightening his arms  about her  slender body, and a little cry came from her a cry that  was a broken  thing, a sob without tears. 
  &quot;Marette!&quot; 
  It was all he said. It was all he could say in that moment when   his heart was beating like a drum against her breast. And then he   felt the slow pressure of her hands against him, saw her white  face,  her wide, staring eyes within a few inches of his own, and  she drew  away from him, back against the wall, still huddled like  a child on  the bed, with her eyes fixed on him in a way that  frightened him.  There were no tears in them. She had not been  crying. But her face was  as white as he had seen it down in  Kedsty's room. Some of the horror  and shock had gone out of it. In  it was another look as her eyes  glowed upon Kent. It was a look of  incredulity, of disbelief, a thing  slowly fading away under the  miracle of an amazing revelation. The  truth thrust itself upon  him. 
  Marette had not expected that he would come to her like this. She   had believed that he would take flight into the night, escaping  from  her as he would have run from a plague. She put up her two  hands, in  the trick they had of groping at her white throat, and  her lips formed  a word which she did not speak. 
  Kent, to his own amazement, was smiling and still on his knees. He   pulled himself to his feet, and stood up straight, looking down at   her in that same strange, comforting, all-powerful way. The thrill  of  it was passing into her veins. A flush of color was driving the   deathly pallor from her face. Her lips were parted, and she  breathed  quickly, a little excitedly. 
  &quot;I thought&#8212;you would go!&quot; she said. 
  &quot;Not without you,&quot; he said. &quot;I have come to take you with me.&quot; 
  He drew out his watch. It was two o'clock. He held it down so that   she could look at the dial. 
  &quot;If the storm keeps up, we have three hours before dawn,&quot; he said.   &quot;How soon can you be ready, Marette?&quot; 
  He was fighting to make his voice quiet and unexcited. It was a   terrific struggle. And Marette was not blind to it. She drew  herself  from the bed and stood up before him, her two hands still  clasped at  her throbbing throat. 
  &quot;You believe&#8212;that I killed Kedsty,&quot; she said in a voice that was   forced from her lips. &quot;And you have come to help me&#8212;to pay me for   what I tried to do for you? That is it&#8212;Jeems?&quot; 
  &quot;Pay you?&quot; he cried. &quot;I couldn't pay you in a million years! From   that day you first came to Cardigan's place you gave me life. You   came when the last spark of hope in me had died. I shall always   believe that I would have died that night. But you saved me. 
  &quot;From the moment I saw you I loved you, and I believe it was that   love that kept me alive. And then you came to me again, down  there,  through this storm. Pay you! I can't. I never shall be able  to.  Because you thought I had killed a man made no difference You  came  just the same. And you came ready to kill, if necessary&#8212;for  me. I'm  not trying to tell myself WHY! But you did. You were ready  to kill.  And I am ready to kill&#8212;tonight&#8212;for you! I haven't got  time to think  about Kedsty. I'm thinking about you. If you killed  him, I'm just  telling myself there was a mighty good reason for  it. But I don't  believe it was you who killed him. You couldn't do  it&#8212;with those  hands!&quot; 
  He reached out suddenly and seized them, slipping his grip to her   wrists, so that her hands lay upward in his own, hands that were   small, slim-fingered, soft-palmed, beautiful. 
  &quot;They couldn't!&quot; he cried, almost fiercely. &quot;I swear to God they   couldn't!&quot; 
  Her eyes and face flamed at his words. &quot;You believe that, Jeems?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, just as you believe that I did not kill John Barkley. But   the world is against us. It is against us both now. And we've got  to  hunt that hidden valley of yours together. Understand, Marette?  And  I'm&#8212;rather glad.&quot; 
  He turned toward the door. &quot;Will you be ready in ten minutes?&quot; he   asked. 
  She nodded. &quot;Yes, in ten minutes.&quot; 
  He ran out into the hall and down the stair, locking the front   door. Then he returned to his hiding-place under the roof. He knew   that a strange sort of madness was in his blood, for in the face  of  tonight's tragedy only madness could inspire him with the  ecstatic  thrill that was in his veins. Kedsty's death seemed far  removed from a  more important thing&#8212;the fact that from this hour  Marette was his to  fight for, that she belonged to him, that she  must go with him. He  loved her. In spite of whoever she was and  whatever she had done, he  loved her. Very soon she would tell him  what had happened in the room  below, and the thing would be clear. 
  There was one little corner of his brain that fought him. It kept   telling him, like a parrot, that it was a tress of Marette's hair   about Kedsty's throat, and that it was the hair that had choked  him.  But Marette would explain that, too. He was sure of it. In  the face of  the facts below he was illogical and unreasonable. He  knew it. But his  love for this girl, who had come strangely and  tragically into his  life, was like an intoxicant. And his faith  was illimitable. She did  not kill Kedsty. Another part of his  brain kept repeating that over  and over, even as he recalled that  only a few hours before she had  told him quite calmly that she  would kill the Inspector of Police&#8212;if  a certain thing should  happen. 
  His hands worked as swiftly as his thoughts. He laced up his   service boots. All the food and dishes on the table he made into a   compact bundle and placed in the shoulder-pack. He carried this  and  the rifle out into the hall. Then he returned to Marette's  room. The  door was closed. At his knock the girl's voice told him  that she was  not quite ready. 
  He waited. He could hear her moving about quickly in her room. An   interval of silence followed. Another five minutes passed&#8212;ten&#8212;   fifteen. He tapped at the door again. This time it was opened. 
  He stared, amazed at the change in Marette. She had stepped back   from the door to let him enter, and stood full in the lamp-glow.  Her  slim, beautiful body was dressed in a velvety blue corduroy;  the coat  was close-fitting and boyish; the skirt came only a  little below her  knees. On her feet were high-topped caribou  boots. About her waist was  a holster and the little black gun. Her  hair was done up and crowded  under a close-fitting turban. She was  exquisitely lovely, as she stood  there waiting for him, and in  that loveliness Kent saw there was not  one thing out of place. The  corduroy, the turban, the short skirt, and  the high, laced boots  were made for the wilderness. She was not a  tenderfoot. She was a  little sourdough&#8212;clear through! Gladness leaped  into Kent's face.  But it was not the transformation of her dress alone  that amazed  him. She was changed in another way. Her cheeks were  flushed. Her  eyes glowed with a strange and wonderful radiance as she  looked at  him. Her lips were red, as he had seen them that first time  at  Cardigan's place. Her pallor, her fear, her horror were gone, and   in their place was the repressed excitement of one about to enter   upon a strange adventure. 
  On the floor was a pack only half as large as Kent's and when he   picked it up, he found it of almost no weight. He fastened it to  his  own pack while Marette put on her raincoat and went down the  stair  ahead of him. In the hall below she was waiting, when he  came down,  with Kedsty's big rubber slicker in her hands. 
  &quot;You must put it on,&quot; she said. 
  She shuddered slightly as she held the garment. The color was   almost gone from her cheeks, as she faced the door beyond which  the  dead man sat in his chair, but the marvelous glow was still in  her  eyes as she helped Kent with his pack and the slicker and  afterward  stood for an instant with her hands touching his breast  and her lips  as if about to speak something which she held back. 
  A few steps beyond them they heard the storm. It seemed to rush   upon the bungalow in a new fury, beating at the door, crashing  over  their heads in thunder, daring them to come out. Kent reached  up and  turned out the hall light. 
  In darkness he opened the door. Rain and wind swept in. With his   free hand he groped out, found Marette, drew her after him, and   closed the door again. Entering from the lighted hall into the  storm  was like being swallowed in a pit of blackness. It engulfed  and  smothered them. Then came suddenly a flash of lightning, and  he saw  Marette's face, white and drenched, but looking at him with  that same  strange glow in her eyes. It thrilled him. Even in the  darkness it was  there. It had been there since he had returned to  her from Kedsty and  had knelt at her bedside, with his arms about  her for a moment. 
  Only now, in the beat of the storm, did an answer to the miracle   of it come to him. It was because of HIM. It was because of his  FAITH  in her. Even death and horror could not keep it from her  eyes. He  wanted to cry out the joy of his discovery, to give wild  voice to it  in the teeth of the wind and the rain. He felt  sweeping through him a  force mightier than that of the night. Her  hands were on his arm, as  if she was afraid of losing him in that  pit of blackness; the soft  cling of them was like a contact  through which came a warm thrill of  electrical life. He put out  his arm and drew her to him, so that for a  moment his face pressed  against the top of her wet little turban. 
  And then he heard her say: &quot;There is a scow at the bayou, Jeems.   It is close to the end of the path. M'sieu Fingers has kept it  there,  waiting, ready.&quot; 
  He had been thinking of Crossen's place and an open boat. He   blessed Fingers again, as he took Marette's hand in his own and   started for the trail that led through the poplar thicket. 
  Their feet slopped deep in wet and mud, and with the rain there   was a wind that took their breath away. It was impossible to see a   tree an arm's length away, and Kent hoped that the lightning would   come frequently enough to guide him. In the first flare of it he   looked down the slope that led riverward. Little rivulets of water   were running down it. Rocks and stumps were in their way, and   underfoot it was slippery. Marette's fingers were clinging to his   again, as she had held to them on the wild race up to Kedsty's   bungalow from the barracks. He had tingled then in the sheer joy  of  their thrill, but it was a different thrill that stirred him  now&#8212;an  overwhelming emotion of possessorship. This night, with  its storm and  its blackness, was the most wonderful of all his  nights. 
  He sensed nothing of its discomfort. It could not beat back the   joyous racing of the blood in his body. Sun and stars, day and  night,  sunshine and cloud, were trivial and inconsequential to him  now. For  close to him, struggling with him, fighting through the  night with  him, trusting him, helpless without him, was the  living, breathing  thing he loved more than he loved his own life.  For many years,  without knowing it, he had waited for this night,  and now that it was  upon him, it inundated and swept away his old  life. He was no longer  the huntsman, but the hunted. He was no  longer alone, but had a  priceless thing to fight for, a priceless  and helpless thing that was  clinging to his fingers in the  darkness. He did not feel like a  fugitive, but as one who has come  into a great triumph. He sensed no  uncertainty or doubt. 
  The river lay ahead, and for him the river had become the soul and   the promise of life. It was Marette's river and his river, and in  a  little while they would be on it. And Marette would then tell  him  about Kedsty. He was sure of that. She would tell him what had   happened while he slept. His faith was illimitable. 
  They came into the sodden dip at the foot of the ridge, and the   lightning revealed to him the edge of the poplar growth in which   O'Connor had seen Marette many weeks ago. The bayou trail wound   through this, and Kent struck out for it blindly in the darkness.  He  did not try to talk, but he freed his companion's hand and put  his arm  about her when they came to the level ground, so that she  was  sheltered by him from the beat of the storm. Then brush  swished in  their faces, and they stopped, waiting for the  lightning again. Kent  was not anxious for it to come. He drew the  girl still closer, and in  that pit of blackness, with the deluge  about her and the crash of  thunder over her head, she snuggled up  against his breast, the throb  of her body against him, waiting,  watching, with him. Her frailty, the  helplessness of her, the  slimness of her in the crook of his arm,  filled him with an  exquisite exultation. He did not think of her now  as the splendid,  fearless creature who had leveled her little black  gun at the  three men in barracks. She was no longer the mysterious,  defiant,  unafraid person who had held him in a sort of awe that first  hour  in Kedsty's place. For she was crumpled against him now, utterly   dependent and afraid. In that chaos of storm something told him  that  her nerve was broken, that without him she would be lost and  would cry  out in fear. AND HE WAS GLAD! He held her tighter; he  bent his head  until his face touched the wet, crushed hair under  the edge of her  turban. And then the lightning split open the  night again, and he saw  the way ahead of him to the trail. 
  Even in darkness it was not difficult to follow in the clean-cut   wagon path. Over their heads the tops of the poplars swished and   wailed. Under their feet the roadway in places was a running  stream  or inundated until it became a pool. In pitch blackness  they struck  such a pool, and in spite of the handicap of his packs  and rifle Kent  stopped suddenly, and picked Marette up in his  arms, and carried her  until they reached high ground. He did not  ask permission. And  Marette, for a minute or two, lay crumpled up  close in his arms, and  for a thrilling instant his face touched  her rain-wet cheek. 
  The miracle of their adventure was that neither spoke. To Kent the   silence between them had become a thing which he had no desire to   break. In that silence, excused and abetted by the tumult of the   storm, he felt that a wonderful something was drawing them closer  and  closer together, and that words might spoil the indescribable  magic of  the thing that was happening. When he set Marette on her  feet again,  her hand accidentally fell upon his, and for a moment  her fingers  closed upon it in a soft pressure that meant more to  him than a  thousand words of gratitude. 
  A quarter of a mile beyond the poplar thicket they came to the   edge of the spruce and cedar timber, and Soon the thick walls of  the  forest shut them in, sheltering them from the wind, but the  blackness  was even more like that of a bottomless pit. Kent had  noticed that the  thunder and lightning were drifting steadily  eastward, and now the  occasional flashes of electrical fire  scarcely illumined the trail  ahead of them. The rain was not  beating so fiercely. They could hear  the wail of the spruce and  cedar tops and the slush of their boots in  mud and water. An  interval came, where the spruce-tops met overhead,  when it was  almost calm. It was then that Kent threw out of him a  great, deep  breath and laughed joyously and exultantly. 
  &quot;Are you wet, little Gray Goose?&quot; 
  &quot;Only outside, Big Otter. My feathers have kept me dry.&quot; 
  Her voice had a trembling, half-sobbing, half-rejoicing note in   it. It was not the voice of one who had recently killed a man. In  it  was a pathos which Kent knew she was trying to hide behind  brave  words. Her hands clung to the arm of his rubber slicker even  as they  stood there, close together, as if she was afraid  something might drag  them apart in that treacherous gloom. Kent,  fumbling for a moment,  drew from an inner pocket a dry  handkerchief. Then he found her face,  tilted it a bit upward, and  wiped it dry. He might have done the same  thing to a child who had  been crying. After that he scrubbed his own,  and they went on, his  arm about her again. 
  It was half a mile from the edge of the forest to the bayou, and   half a dozen times in that distance Kent took the girl in his arms   and carried her through water that almost reached his boot tops.  The  lightning no longer served them. The rain still fell steadily,  but the  wind had gone with the eastward sweep of the storm. Close-  hung with  the forest walls, the bayou itself was indiscernible in  the blackness.  Marette guided him now, though Kent walked ahead of  her, holding  firmly to her hand. Unless Fingers had changed its  location, the scow  should be somewhere within forty or fifty paces  of the end of the  trail. It was small, a two-man scow, with a  tight little house built  amidships. And it was tied close up  against the shore. Marette told  him this as they felt their way  through brush and reeds. Then he  stumbled against something taut  and knee-high, and he found it was the  tie-rope. 
  Leaving Marette with her back to the anchor tree, he went aboard.   The water was three or four inches deep in the bottom of the scow,   but the cabin was built on a platform raised above the floor of  the  boat, and Kent hoped it was still dry. He groped until he  found the  twisted wire which held the door shut. Opening it, he  ducked his head  low and entered. The little room was not more than  four feet high, and  for greater convenience he fell upon his knees  while fumbling under  his slicker for his water-proof box of  matches. The water had not yet  risen above the floor. 
  The first light he struck revealed the interior to him. It was a   tiny cabin, scarcely larger than some boxes he had seen. It was  about  eight feet long by six in width, and the ceiling was so low  that, even  kneeling, his head touched it. His match burned out,  and he lighted  another. This time he saw a candle stuck in a bit  of split birch that  projected from the wall. He crept to it and  lighted it. For a moment  he looked about him, and again he blessed  Fingers. The little scow was  prepared for a voyage. Two narrow  bunks were built at the far end, one  so close above the other that  Kent grinned as he thought of squeezing  between. There were  blankets. Within reach of his arm was a tiny  stove, and close to  the stove a supply of kindling and dry wood. The  whole thing made  him think of a child's playhouse. Yet there was still  room for a  wide, comfortable, cane-bottomed chair, a stool, and a  smooth-  planed board fastened under a window, so that it answered the   purpose of a table. This table was piled with many packages. 
  He stripped off his packs and returned for Marette. She had come   to the edge of the scow and called to him softly as she heard him   splashing through the water. Her arms were reaching toward him, to   meet him in the darkness. He carried her through the shallow sea   about his feet and laughed as he put her down on the edge of the   platform at the door. It was a low, joyous laugh. The yellow light  of  the candle sputtered in their wet faces. Only dimly could he  see her,  but her eyes were shining. 
  &quot;Your nest, little Gray Goose,&quot; he cried gently. 
  Her hand reached up and touched his face. &quot;You have been good to   me, Jeems,&quot; she said, a little tremble in her voice. &quot;You may&#8212;  kiss  me.&quot; 
  Out in the beat of the rain Kent's heart choked him with song. His   soul swelled with the desire to shout forth a paean of joy and   triumph at the world he was leaving this night for all time. With  the  warm thrill of Marette's lips he had become the superman, and  as he  leaped ashore in the darkness and cut the tie-rope with a  single slash  of his knife, he wanted to give voice to the thing  that was in him as  the rivermen had chanted in the glory of their  freedom the day the big  brigade started north. And he DID sing,  under his laughing, sobbing  breath. With a giant's strength he  sent the scow out into the bayou,  and then back and forth he swung  the long one-man sweep, twisting the  craft riverward with the  force of two pairs of arms instead of one.  Behind the closed door  of the tiny cabin was all that the world now  held worth fighting  for. By turning his head he could see the faint  illumination of  the candle at the window. The light&#8212;the  cabin&#8212;Marette! 
  He laughed inanely, foolishly, like a boy. He began to hear a   dull, droning murmur, a sound that with each stroke of the sweep  grew  into a more distinct, cataract-like roar. It was the river.  Swollen by  flood, it was a terrifying sound. But Kent did not  dread it. It was  his river; it was his friend. It was the pulse  and throb of life to  him now. The growing tumult of it was not  menace, but the joyous  thunder of many voices calling to him,  rejoicing at his coming. It  grew in his ears. Over his head the  black sky opened again, and a  deluge of rain fell straight down.  But above the sound of it the rush  of the river drew nearer, and  still nearer. He felt the first eddying  swirl of it against the  scow head, and powerful hands seemed to reach  in out of the  darkness. He knew that the nose of the current had  caught him and  was carrying him out on the breast of the stream. He  shipped the  sweep and straightened himself, facing the utter chaos of   blackness ahead.
