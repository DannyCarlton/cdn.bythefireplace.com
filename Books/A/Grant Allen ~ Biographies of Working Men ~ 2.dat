Any time about the year 1786, a stranger in the streets of the grimy  colliery village of Wylam, near Newcastle, might have passed by without  notice a ragged, barefooted, chubby child of five years old, Geordie  Stephenson by name, playing merrily in the gutter and looking to the  outward eye in no way different from any of the other colliers' children  who loitered about him. Nevertheless, that ragged boy was yet destined  in after-life to alter the whole face of England and the world by those  wonderful railways, which he more than any other man was instrumental in  first constructing; and the story of his life may rank perhaps as one of  the most marvellous in the whole marvellous history of able and  successful British working men.    
George Stephenson was born in June, 1781, the son of a fireman who  tended the pumping engine of the neighbouring colliery, and one of a  penniless family of six children. So poor was his father, indeed, that  the whole household lived in a single room, with bare floor and mud  wall; and little Geordie grew up in his own unkempt fashion without any  schooling whatever, not even knowing A from B when he was a big lad of  seventeen. At an age when he ought to have been learning his letters, he  was bird's-nesting in the fields or running errands to the Wylam shops;  and as soon as he was old enough to earn a few pence by light work, he  was set to tend cows at the magnificent wages of twopence a day, in the  village of Dewley Burn, close by, to which his father had then removed.  It might have seemed at first as though the future railway engineer was  going to settle down quietly to the useful but uneventful life of an  agricultural labourer; for from tending cows he proceeded in due time  (with a splendid advance of twopence) to leading the horses at the  plough, spudding thistles, and hoeing turnips on his employer's farm.  But the native bent of a powerful mind usually shows itself very early;  and even during the days when Geordie was still stumbling across the  freshly ploughed clods or driving the cows to pasture with a bunch of  hazel twigs, his taste for mechanics already made itself felt in a very  marked and practical fashion. During all his leisure time, the future  engineer and his chum Bill Thirlwall occupied themselves with making  clay models of engines, and fitting up a winding machine with corks and  twine like those which lifted the colliery baskets. Though Geordie  Stephenson didn't go to school at the village teacher's, he was teaching  himself in his own way by close observation and keen comprehension of  all the machines and engines he could come across.    
Naturally, to such a boy, the great ambition of his life was to be  released from the hoeing and spudding, and set to work at his father's  colliery. Great was Geordie's joy, therefore, when at last he was taken  on there in the capacity of a coal-picker, to clear the loads from  stones and rubbish. It wasn't a very dignified position, to be sure, but  it was the first step that led the way to the construction of the  Liverpool and Manchester Railway. Geordie was now fairly free from the  uncongenial drudgery of farm life, and able to follow his own  inclinations in the direction of mechanical labour. Besides, was he not  earning the grand sum of sixpence a day as picker, increased to  eightpence a little later on, when he rose to the more responsible and  serious work of driving the gin-horse? A proud day indeed it was for him  when, at fourteen, he was finally permitted to aid his father in firing  the colliery engine; though he was still such a very small boy that he  used to run away and hide when the owner went his rounds of inspection,  for fear he should be thought too little to earn his untold wealth of a  shilling a day in such a grown-up occupation. Humbler beginnings were  never any man's who lived to become the honoured guest, not of kings and  princes only, but of the truly greatest and noblest in the land.    
A coal-miner's life is often a very shifting one; for the coal in  particular collieries gets worked out from time to time; and he has to  remove, accordingly, to fresh quarters, wherever employment happens to  be found. This was very much the case with George Stephenson and his  family; all of them being obliged to remove several times over during  his childish days in search of new openings. Shortly after Geordie had  attained to the responsible position of assistant fireman, his father  was compelled, by the closing of Dewley Burn mine, to get a fresh  situation hard by at Newburn. George accompanied him, and found  employment as full fireman at a small working, whose little engine he  undertook to manage in partnership with a mate, each of them tending the  fire night and day by twelve-hour shifts. Two years later, his wages  were raised to twelve shillings a week, a sure mark of his diligent and  honest work; so that George was not far wrong in remarking to a fellow-  workman at the time that he now considered himself a made man for life.    
During all this time, George Stephenson never for a moment ceased to  study and endeavour to understand the working of every part in the  engine that he tended. He was not satisfied, as too many workmen are,  with merely learning the routine work of his own trade; with merely  knowing that he must turn such and such a tap or valve in order to  produce such and such a desired result: he wanted to see for himself how  and why the engine did this or that, what was the use and object of  piston and cylinder and crank and joint and condenser--in short, fully  to understand the underlying principle of its construction. He took it  to pieces for cleaning whenever it was needful; he made working models  of it after his old childish pattern; he even ventured to tinker it up  when out of order on his own responsibility. Thus he learnt at last  something of the theory of the steam-engine, and learnt also by the way  a great deal about the general principles of mechanical science. Still,  even now, incredible as it seems, the future father of railways couldn't  yet read; and he found this terrible drawback told fatally against his  further progress. Whenever he wanted to learn something that he didn't  quite understand, he was always referred for information to a Book. Oh,  those books; those mysterious, unattainable, incomprehensible books; how  they must have bothered and worried poor intelligent and aspiring but  still painfully ignorant young George Stephenson! Though he was already  trying singularly valuable experiments in his own way, he hadn't yet  even begun to learn his letters.    
Under these circumstances, George Stephenson, eager and anxious for  further knowledge, took a really heroic resolution. He wasn't ashamed to  go to school. Though now a full workman on his own account, about  eighteen years old, he began to attend the night school at the  neighbouring village of Walbottle, where he took lessons in reading  three evenings every week. It is a great thing when a man is not ashamed  to learn. Many men are; they consider themselves so immensely wise that  they look upon it as an impertinence in anybody to try to tell them  anything they don't know already. Truly wise or truly great men--men  with the capability in them for doing anything worthy in their  generation--never feel this false and foolish shame. They know that most  other people know some things in some directions which they do not, and  they are glad to be instructed in them whenever opportunity offers. This  wisdom George Stephenson possessed in sufficient degree to make him feel  more ashamed of his ignorance than of the steps necessary in order to  conquer it. Being a diligent and willing scholar, he soon learnt to  read, and by the time he was nineteen he had learnt how to write also.  At arithmetic, a science closely allied to his native mechanical bent,  he was particularly apt, and beat all the other scholars at the village  night school. This resolute effort at education was the real turning-  point in George Stephenson's remarkable career, the first step on the  ladder whose topmost rung led him so high that he himself must almost  have felt giddy at the unwonted elevation.    
Shortly after, young Stephenson gained yet another promotion in being  raised to the rank of brakesman, whose duty it was to slacken the engine  when the full baskets of coal reached the top of the shaft. This was a  more serious and responsible post than any he had yet filled, and one  for which only the best and steadiest workmen were ever selected. His  wages now amounted to a pound a week, a very large sum in those days for  a skilled working-man.    
Meanwhile, George, like most other young men, had fallen in love. His  sweetheart, Fanny Henderson, was servant at the small farmhouse where he  had taken lodgings since leaving his father's home; and though but  little is known about her (for she unhappily died before George had  begun to rise to fame and fortune), what little we do know seems to show  that she was in every respect a fitting wife for the active young  brakesman, and a fitting mother for his equally celebrated son, Robert  Stephenson. Fired by the honourable desire to marry Fanny, with a proper  regard for prudence, George set himself to work to learn cobbling in his  spare moments; and so successfully did he cobble the worn shoes of his  fellow-colliers after working hours, that before long he contrived to  save a whole guinea out of his humble earnings. That guinea was the  first step towards an enormous fortune; a fortune, too, all accumulated  by steady toil and constant useful labour for the ultimate benefit of  his fellow-men. To make a fortune is the smallest and least noble of all  possible personal ambitions; but to save the first guinea which leads us  on at last to independence and modest comfort is indeed an important  turning-point in every prudent man's career. Geordie Stephenson was so  justly proud of his achievement in this respect that he told a friend in  confidence he might now consider himself a rich man.    
By the time George was twenty-one, he had saved up enough by constant  care to feel that he might safely embark on the sea of housekeeping. He  was able to take a small cottage lodging for himself and Fanny, at  Willington Quay, near his work at the moment, and to furnish it with the  simple comfort which was all that their existing needs demanded. He  married Fanny on the 28th of November, 1802; and the young couple  proceeded at once to their new home. Here George laboured harder than  ever, as became the head of a family. He was no more ashamed of odd jobs  than he had been of learning the alphabet. He worked overtime at  emptying ballast from ships; he continued to cobble, to cut lasts, and  even to try his hand at regular shoemaking; furthermore, he actually  acquired the art of mending clocks, a matter which lay strictly in his  own line, and he thus earned a tidy penny at odd hours by doctoring all  the rusty or wheezy old timepieces of all his neighbours. Nor did he  neglect his mechanical education meanwhile; for he was always at work  upon various devices for inventing a perpetual motion machine. Now  perpetual motion is the most foolish will-o'-the-wisp that ever engaged  a sane man's attention: the thing has been proved to be impossible from  every conceivable point of view, and the attempt to achieve it, if  pursued to the last point, can only end in disappointment if not in  ruin. Still, for all that, the work George Stephenson spent upon this  unpractical object did really help to give him an insight into  mechanical science which proved very useful to him at a later date. He  didn't discover perpetual motion, but he did invent at last the real  means for making the locomotive engine a practical power in the matter  of travelling.    
A year later, George's only son Robert was born; and from that moment  the history of those two able and useful lives is almost inseparable.  During the whole of George Stephenson's long upward struggle, and during  the hard battle he had afterwards to fight on behalf of his grand design  of railways, he met with truer sympathy, appreciation, and comfort from  his brave and gifted son than from any other person whatsoever.  Unhappily, his pleasure and delight in the up-bringing of his boy was  soon to be clouded for a while by the one great bereavement of an  otherwise singularly placid and happy existence. Some two years after  her marriage, Fanny Stephenson died, as yet a mere girl, leaving her  lonely husband to take care of their baby boy alone and unaided. Grief  for this irretrievable loss drove the young widower away for a while  from his accustomed field of work among the Tyneside coal-pits; he  accepted an invitation to go to Montrose in Scotland, to overlook the  working of a large engine in some important spinning-works. He remained  in this situation for one year only; but during that time he managed to  give clear evidence of his native mechanical insight by curing a defect  in the pumps which supplied water to his engine, and which had hitherto  defied the best endeavours of the local engineers. The young father was  not unmindful, either, of his duty to his boy, whom he had left behind  with his grandfather on Tyneside; for he saved so large a sum as L28  during his engagement, which he carried back with him in his pocket on  his return to England.    
A sad disappointment awaited him when at last he arrived at home. Old  Robert Stephenson, the father, had met with an accident during George's  absence which made him quite blind, and incapacitated him for further  work. Helpless and poor, he had no resource to save him from the  workhouse except George; but George acted towards him exactly as all men  who have in them a possibility of any good thing always do act under  similar circumstances. He spent L15 of his hard-earned savings to pay  the debts the poor blind old engine-man had necessarily contracted  during his absence, and he took a comfortable cottage for his father and  mother at Killingworth, where he had worked before his removal to  Scotland, and where he now once more obtained employment, still as a  brakesman. In that cottage this good and brave son supported his aged  parents till their death, in all the simple luxury that his small means  would then permit him.    
That, however, was not the end of George's misfortunes. Shortly after,  he was drawn by lot as a militiaman; and according to the law of that  time (for this was in 1807, during the very height of the wars against  Napoleon) he must either serve in person or else pay heavily to secure a  substitute. George chose regretfully the latter course--the only one  open to him if he wished still to support his parents and his infant  son. But in order to do so, he had to pay away the whole remainder of  his carefully hoarded savings, and even to borrow L6 to make up the  payment for the substitute. It must have seemed very hard to him to do  this, and many men would have sunk under the blow, become hopeless, or  taken to careless rowdy drinking habits. George Stephenson felt it  bitterly, and gave way for a while to a natural despondency; he would  hardly have been human if he had not; but still, he lived over it, and  in the end worked on again with fuller resolution and vigour than ever.    
For several years Geordie, as his fellow-colliers affectionately called  him, continued to live on at one or other of the Killingworth  collieries. In a short time, he entered into a small contract with his  employers for "brakeing" the engines; and in the course of this  contract, he invented certain improvements in the matter of saving wear  and tear of ropes, which were both profitable to himself and also in  some small degree pointed the way toward his future plans for the  construction of railways. It is true, the two subjects have not,  apparently, much in common; but they are connected in this way, that  both proceed upon the principle of reducing the friction to the smallest  possible quantity. It was this principle that Stephenson was gradually  learning to appreciate more and more at its proper value; and it was  this which finally led him to the very summit of a great and pre-  eminently useful profession. The great advantage, indeed, of a level  railway over an up-and-down ordinary road is simply that in the railway  the resistance and friction are almost entirely got rid of.    
It was in 1810, when Stephenson was twenty-nine, that his first  experiment in serious engineering was made. A coal-pit had been sunk at  Killingworth, and a rude steam-engine of that time had been set to pump  the water out of its shaft; but, somehow, the engine made no headway  against the rising springs at the bottom of the mine. For nearly a year  the engine worked away in vain, till at last, one Saturday afternoon,  Geordie Stephenson went over to examine her. "Well, George," said a  pitman, standing by, "what do you think of her?" "Man," said George,  boldly, "I could alter her and make her draw. In a week I could let you  all go the bottom." The pitman reported this confident speech of the  young brakesman to the manager; and the manager, at his wits' end for a  remedy, determined to let this fellow Stephenson try his hand at her.  After all, if he did no good, he would be much like all the others; and  anyhow he seemed to have confidence in himself, which, if well grounded,  is always a good thing.    
George's confidence <i>was</i> well grounded. It was not the confidence  of ignorance, but that of knowledge. He <i>understood</i> the engine  now, and he saw at once the root of the evil. He picked the engine to  pieces, altered it to suit the requirements of the case, and set it to  work to pump without delay. Sure enough, he kept his word; and within  the week, the mine was dry, and the men were sent to the bottom. This  was a grand job for George's future. The manager, a Mr. Dodds, not only  gave him ten pounds at once as a present, in acknowledgment of his  practical skill, but also appointed him engine-man of the new pit,  another rise in the social scale as well as in the matter of wages.  Dodds kept him in mind for the future, too; and a couple of years later,  on a vacancy occurring, he promoted the promising hand to be engine-  wright of all the collieries under his management, at a salary of L100 a  year. When a man's income comes to be reckoned by the year, rather than  by the week or month, it is a sign that he is growing into a person of  importance. George had now a horse to ride upon, on his visits of  inspection to the various engines; and his work was rather one of  mechanical engineering than of mere ordinary labouring handicraft.    
The next few years of George Stephenson's life were mainly taken up in  providing for the education of his boy Robert. He had been a good son,  and he was now a good father. Feeling acutely how much he himself had  suffered, and how many years he had been put back, by his own want of a  good sound rudimentary education, he determined that Robert should not  suffer from a similar cause. Indeed, George Stephenson's splendid  abilities were kept in the background far too long, owing to his early  want of regular instruction. So the good father worked hard to send his  boy to school; not to the village teacher's only, but to a school for  gentlemen's sons at Newcastle. By mending clocks and watches in spare  moments, and by rigid economy in all unnecessary expenses (especially  beer), Stephenson had again gathered together a little hoard, which  mounted up this time to a hundred guineas. A hundred guineas is a  fortune and a capital to a working man. He was therefore rich enough,  not only to send little Robert to school, but even to buy him a donkey,  on which the boy made the journey every day from Killingworth to  Newcastle. This was in 1815, when George was thirty-four, and Robert  twelve. Perhaps no man who ever climbed so high as George Stephenson,  had ever reached so little of the way at so comparatively late an age.  For in spite of his undoubted success, viewed from the point of view of  his origin and early prospects, he was as yet after all nothing more  than the common engine-wright of the Killingworth collieries--a long way  off as yet from the distinguished father of the railway system.    
George Stephenson's connection with the locomotive, however, was even  now beginning. Already, in 1816, he and his boy had tried a somewhat  higher flight of mechanical and scientific skill than usual, in the  construction of a sun-dial, which involves a considerable amount of  careful mathematical work; and now George found that the subject of  locomotive engines was being forced by circumstances upon his attention.  From the moment he was appointed engine-wright of the Killingworth  collieries, he began to think about all possible means of hauling coal  at cheaper rates from the pit's mouth to the shipping place on the  river. For that humble object alone--an object that lay wholly within  the line of his own special business--did the great railway projector  set out upon his investigations into the possibilities of the  locomotive. Indeed, in its earliest origin, the locomotive was almost  entirely connected with coals and mining; its application to passenger  traffic on the large scale was quite a later and secondary  consideration. It was only by accident, so to speak, that the true  capabilities of railways were finally discovered in the actual course of  their practical employment. George Stephenson was not the first person  to construct either a locomotive or a tramway. Both were already in use,  in more or less rude forms, at several collieries. But he <i>was</i> the  first person to bring the two to such a pitch of perfection, that what  had been at first a mere clumsy mining contrivance, became developed  into a smooth and easy iron highway for the rapid and convenient  conveyance of goods and passengers over immense distances. Of course,  this great invention, like all other great inventions, was not the work  of one day or one man. Many previous heads had helped to prepare the way  for George Stephenson; and George Stephenson himself had been working at  the subject for many years before he even reached the first stage of  realized endeavour. As early as 1814 he constructed his first locomotive  at Killingworth colliery; it was not until 1822 that he laid the first  rail of his first large line, the Stockton and Darlington Railway.    
Stephenson's earliest important improvement in the locomotive consisted  in his invention of what is called the steam-blast, by which the steam  is made to increase the draught of the fire, and so largely add to the  effectiveness of the engine. It was this invention that enabled him at  last to make the railway into the great carrier of the world, and to  begin the greatest social and commercial upheaval that has ever occurred  in the whole history of the human race.    
Meanwhile, however, George was not entirely occupied with the  consideration of his growing engine. He had the clocks and watches to  mend; he had Robert's schooling to look after; and he had another  practical matter even nearer home than the locomotive on which to  exercise his inventive genius. One day, in 1814, the main gallery of the  colliery caught fire. Stephenson at once descended into the burning pit,  with a chosen band of volunteers, who displayed the usual heroic courage  of colliers in going to the rescue of their comrades; and, at the risk  of their lives, these brave men bricked up the burning portion, and so,  by excluding the air, put out the dangerous fire. Still, even so,  several of the workmen had been suffocated, and one of the pitmen asked  Geordie in dismay whether nothing could be done to prevent such terrible  disasters in future. "The price of coal-mining now," he said, "is  pitmen's lives." Stephenson promised to think the matter over; and he  did think it over with good effect. The result of his thought was the  apparatus still affectionately known to the pitmen as "the Geordie  lamp." It is a lamp so constructed that the flame cannot pass out into  the air outside, and so cause explosions in the dangerous fire-damp  which is always liable to occur abundantly in the galleries of coal  mines. By this invention alone George Stephenson's name and memory might  have been kept green for ever; for his lamp has been the means of saving  thousands of lives from a sudden, a terrible, and a pitiful death. Most  accidents that now occur in mines are due to the neglect of ordinary  precautions, and to the perverse habit of carrying a naked lighted  candle in the hand (contrary to regulations) instead of a carefully  guarded safety lamp. Yet so culpably reckless of their own and other  men's lives are a large number of people everywhere, that in spite of  the most stringent and salutary rules, explosions from this cause (and,  therefore, easily avoidable) take place constantly to the present day,  though far less frequently than before the invention of the Geordie  lamp.    
Curiously enough, at the very time when George Stephenson was busy  inventing his lamp at Killingworth, Sir Humphrey Davy was working at  just the same matter in London; and the two lamps, though a little  different in minor points of construction, are practically the same in  general principle. Now, Sir Humphrey was then the great fashionable  natural philosopher of the day, the favourite of London society, and the  popular lecturer of the Royal Institution. His friends thought it a  monstrous idea that his splendid life-saving apparatus should have been  independently devised by "an engine-wright of Killingworth of the name  of Stephenson--a person not even possessing a knowledge of the elements  of chemistry." This sounds very odd reading at the present day, when the  engine-wright of the name of Stephenson has altered the whole face of  the world, while Davy is chiefly remembered as a meritorious and able  chemist; but at the time, Stephenson's claim to the invention met with  little courtesy from the great public of London, where a meeting was  held on purpose to denounce his right to the credit of the invention.  What the coal-owners and colliers of the North Country thought about the  matter was sufficiently shown by their subscription of L1000, as a  Stephenson testimonial fund. With part of the money, a silver tankard  was presented to the deserving engine-wright, while the remainder of the  sum was handed over to him in ready cash. A very acceptable present it  was, and one which George Stephenson remembered with pride down to his  dying day. The Geordie lamp continues in use to the present moment in  the Tyneside collieries with excellent effect.    
For some years more, Mr. Stephenson (he is now fairly entitled to that  respectable prefix) went on still further experimenting on the question  of locomotives and railways. He was now beginning to learn that much  unnecessary wear and tear arose on the short lines of rail down from the  pit's mouths to the loading-places on the river by the inequalities and  roughnesses of the joints; and he invented a method of overlapping the  rails which quite got over this source of loss--loss of speed, loss of  power, and loss of material at once. It was in 1819 that he laid down  his first considerable piece of road, the Hetton railway. The owners of  a colliery at the village of Hetton, in Durham, determined to replace  their waggon road by a locomotive line; and they invited the now locally  famous Killingworth engine-wright to act as their engineer. Stephenson  gladly undertook the post; and he laid down a railway of eight miles in  length, on the larger part of which the trucks were to be drawn by "the  iron horse," as people now began to style the altered and improved  locomotive. The Hetton railway was opened in 1822, and the assembled  crowd were delighted at beholding a single engine draw seventeen loaded  trucks after it, at the extraordinary rate of four miles an hour--nearly  as fast as a man could walk. Whence it may be gathered that Stephenson's  ideas upon the question of speed were still on a very humble scale  indeed.    
Before the Hetton railway was opened, however, George Stephenson had  shown one more proof of his excellence as a father by sending his boy  Robert, now nineteen, to Edinburgh University. It was a serious expense  for a man who was even now, after all, hardly more than a working man of  the superior grade; but George Stephenson was well repaid for the  sacrifice he thus made on behalf of his only son. He lived to see him  the greatest practical engineer of his own time, and to feel that his  success was in large measure due to the wider and more accurate  scientific training the lad had received from his Edinburgh teachers.    
In 1819 George married again, his second wife being the daughter of a  farmer at Black Callerton.    
The work which finally secured the position of George Stephenson and of  his dearly loved locomotive was the Stockton and Darlington railway.  Like all the other early railways, it was originally projected simply as  a mineral line. Darlington lies in the centre of a rich inland mining  district; but the impossibility of getting the coal carried to the sea  by cart or donkey long prevented the opening up of its immense natural  wealth. At last, as early as 1817, Edward Pease and a few other  enterprising Darlington Quakers determined to build a line of railway  from the mining region to Stockton, on the river Tees, where the coal  could be loaded into sea-going ships. It was a very long line, compared  to any railway that had yet been constructed; but it was still only to  be worked by horse-power--to be, in fact, what we now call a tramway,  rather than a railway in the modern sense. However, while the plan was  still undecided, George Stephenson, who had heard about the proposed  scheme, went over to Darlington one day, and boldly asked to see Mr.  Pease. The good Quaker received him kindly, and listened to his  arguments in favour of the locomotive. "Come over to Killingworth some  day and see my engine at work," said Stephenson, confidently; "and if  you do you will never think of horses again." Mr. Pease, with Quaker  caution, came and looked. George put the engine through its paces, and  showed off its marvellous capabilities to such good effect that Edward  Pease was immediately converted. Henceforth, he became a decided  advocate of locomotives, and greatly aided by his wealth and influence  in securing their final triumph.    
Not only that, but Mr. Pease also aided Stephenson in carrying out a  design which George had long had upon his mind--the establishment of a  regular locomotive factory, where the work of engine-making for this  particular purpose might be carried on with all the necessary finish and  accuracy. George himself put into the concern his precious L1000, not  one penny of which he had yet touched; while Pease and a friend advanced  as much between them. A factory was forthwith started at Newcastle on a  small scale, and the hardworking engine-wright found himself now fully  advanced to the commercial dignity of Stephenson and Co. With the  gradual growth of railways, that humble Newcastle factory grew gradually  into one of the largest and wealthiest manufacturing establishments in  all England.    
Meanwhile, Stephenson was eagerly pushing on the survey of the Stockton  and Darlington railway, all the more gladly now that he knew it was to  be worked by means of his own adopted child, the beloved locomotive. He  worked at his line early and late; he took the sights with the spirit-  level with his own eye; he was determined to make it a model railway. It  was a long and heavy work, for railway surveying was then a new art, and  the appliances were all fresh and experimental; but in the end,  Stephenson brought it to a happy conclusion, and struck at once the  death-blow of the old road-travelling system. The line was opened  successfully in 1825, and the engine started off on the inaugural  ceremony with a magnificent train of thirty-eight vehicles. "Such was  its velocity," says a newspaper of the day, "that in some parts the  speed was frequently twelve miles an hour."    
The success of the Stockton and Darlington railway was so immense and  unexpected, the number of passengers who went by it was so great, and  the quantity of coal carried for shipment so far beyond anything the  projectors themselves could have anticipated, that a desire soon began  to be felt for similar works in other places. There are no two towns in  England which absolutely need a railway communication from one to the  other so much as Liverpool and Manchester. The first is the great port  of entry for cotton, the second is the great centre of its manufacture.  The Bridgewater canal had helped for a time to make up for the want of  water communication between those two closely connected towns; but as  trade developed, the canal became too small for the demands upon it, and  the need for an additional means of intercourse was deeply felt. A  committee was formed to build a railway in this busy district, and after  a short time George Stephenson was engaged to superintend its  construction.    
A long and severe fight was fought over the Liverpool and Manchester  railway, and it was at first doubtful whether the scheme would ever be  carried out. Many great landowners were strongly opposed to it, and  tried their best to keep the bill for authorizing it from passing  through Parliament. Stephenson himself was compelled to appear in London  as a witness before a parliamentary committee, and was closely cross-  examined as to the possibilities of his plan. In those days, even after  the success of the Stockton and Darlington line, his views about the  future of railways were still regarded by most sober persons as  ridiculously wild and enthusiastic; while the notion that trains might  be made to travel twice as fast as stage-coaches, was scouted as the  most palpable and ridiculous delusion. One of the members of the  committee pressed Stephenson very hard with questions. "Suppose," he  said, "a cow were to get upon the line, and the engine were to come into  collision with it; wouldn't that be very awkward, now?" George looked up  at him with a merry twinkle of the eye, and answered in his broad North  Country dialect, "Oo, ay, very awkward for the <i>coo</i>."    
In spite of all Stephenson's earnestness and mother wit, however,  Parliament refused to pass the bill (in 1825), and for the moment the  engineer's vexation was bitter to behold. He and his friends plucked up  heart, however; they were fighting the winning battle against prejudice  and obstruction, and they were sure to conquer in the long run. The line  was resurveyed by other engineers; the lands of the hostile owners were  avoided; the causes of offence were dexterously smoothed down; and after  another hard fight, in 1826, the bill authorizing the construction of  the Liverpool and Manchester railway was finally passed. The board at  once appointed Stephenson engineer for constructing the line, at a  salary of L1000 a year. George might now fairly consider himself  entitled to the honours of an Esquire.    
The line was a difficult one to construct; but George Stephenson set  about it with the skill and knowledge acquired during many years of slow  experience; and he performed it with distinguished success. He was now  forty-four; and he had had more to do with the laying down of rails than  any other man then living. The great difficulty of the Liverpool and  Manchester line lay in the fact that it had to traverse a vast shaking  bog or morass, Chat Moss, which the best engineers had emphatically  declared it would be impossible to cross. George Stephenson, however,  had a plan for making the impossible possible. He simply floated his  line on a broad bottom, like a ship, on the top of the quaking quagmire;  and proceeded to lay down his rails on this seemingly fragile support  without further scruple. It answered admirably, and still answers to the  present day. The other works on the railway, especially the cuttings,  were such as might well have appalled the boldest heart in those  experimental ages of railway enterprise. It is easy enough for us now to  undertake tunnelling great hills or filling up wide valleys with long  ranges of viaduct, because the thing has been done so often, and the  prospect of earning a fair return on the money sunk can be calculated  with so high a degree of reasonable probability. But it required no  little faith for George Stephenson and his backers to drive a level  road, for the first time, through solid rocks and over trembling  morasses, the whole way from Liverpool to Manchester. He persevered,  however, and in 1830, after four years' toilsome and ceaseless labour,  during which he had worked far-harder than the sturdiest navvy on the  line, his railway was finally opened for regular traffic.    
Before the completion of the railway, George Stephenson had taken part  in a great contest for the best locomotive at Liverpool, a prize of L500  having been offered by the company to the successful competitor.  Stephenson sent in his improved model, the Rocket, constructed after  plans of his own and his son Robert's, and it gained the prize against  all its rivals, travelling at what was then considered the incredible  rate of 35 miles an hour. It was thus satisfactorily settled that the  locomotive was the best power for drawing carriages on railways, and  George Stephenson's long battle was thus at last practically won. The  opening of the Liverpool and Manchester railway was an era in the  history of the world. From the moment that great undertaking was  complete, there could no longer be any doubt about the utility and  desirability of railways, and all opposition died away almost at once.  New lines began immediately to be laid out, and in an incredibly short  time the face of England was scarred by the main trunks in that network  of iron roads with which its whole surface is now so closely covered.  The enormous development of the railway system benefited the Stephenson  family in more than one way. Robert Stephenson became the engineer of  the vast series of lines now known as the London and North Western; and  the increased demand for locomotives caused George Stephenson's small  factory at Newcastle to blossom out suddenly into an immense and  flourishing manufacturing concern.    
The rest of George Stephenson's life is one long story of unbroken  success. In 1831, the year after the opening of the Liverpool and  Manchester line, George, being now fifty, began to think of settling  down in a more permanent home. His son Robert, who was surveying the  Leicester and Swannington railway, observed on an estate called  Snibston, near Ashby-de-la-Zouch, what to his experienced geological eye  looked like the probable indications of coal beneath the surface. He  wrote to his father about it, and as the estate was at the time for  sale, George, now a comparatively wealthy man, bought it up on his son's  recommendation. He also pitched his home close by at Alton Grange, and  began to sink shafts in search of coal. He found it in due time; and  thus, in addition to his Newcastle works he became a flourishing  colliery proprietor. It is pleasing to note that Stephenson, unlike too  many other self-made men, always treated his workmen with the greatest  kindness and consideration, erecting admirable cottages for their  accommodation, and providing them with church, chapel, and schools for  their religious and social education.    
While living at Alton Grange, Stephenson was engaged in laying out  several new lines in the middle and north of England, especially the  Grand Junction and the Midland, both of which he constructed with great  boldness and practical skill. As he grew older and more famous, he began  to mix in the truly best society of England; his acquaintance being  sought by all the most eminent men in literature, science, and political  life. Though but an uneducated working man by origin, George Stephenson  had so improved his mind by constant thought and expansive self-  education, that he was able to meet these able and distinguished friends  of his later days on terms of perfect intellectual and social equality.  To the last, however, he never forgot his older and poorer friends, nor  was he ever ashamed of their acquaintance. A pleasant trait is narrated  by his genial biographer, Dr. Smiles, who notices that on one occasion  he stopped to speak to one of his wealthy acquaintances in a fine  carriage, and then turned to shake hands with the coachman on the box,  whom he had known and respected in his earlier days. He enjoyed, too,  the rare pleasure of feeling his greatness recognized in his own time:  and once, when he went over to Brussels on a visit to the king of the  Belgians, he was pleased and surprised, as the royal party entered the  ball-room at the Town Hall, to hear a general murmur among the guests of  "Which is Stephenson?"    
George Stephenson continued to live for sixteen years, first at Alton  Grange, and afterwards at Tapton House, near Chesterfield, in comfort  and opulence; growing big pines and melons, keeping birds and dogs, and  indulging himself towards the end in the well-earned repose to which his  useful and laborious life fully entitled him. At last, on the 12th of  August, 1848, he died suddenly of intermittent fever, in his sixty-  seventh year, and was peacefully buried in Chesterfield church. Probably  no one man who ever lived did so much to change and renovate the whole  aspect of human life as George Stephenson; and, unlike many other  authors of great revolutions, he lived long enough to see the full  result of his splendid labours in the girdling of England by his iron  roads. A grand and simple man, he worked honestly and steadfastly  throughout his days, and he found his reward in the unprecedented  benefits which his locomotive was even then conferring upon his fellow-  men. It is indeed wonderful to think how very different is the England  in which we live to-day, from that in which we might possibly have been  living were it not for the barefooted little collier boy who made clay  models of engines at Wylam, and who grew at last into the great and  famous engineer of the marvellous Liverpool and Manchester railway. The  main characteristic of George Stephenson was perseverance; and it was  that perseverance that enabled him at last to carry out his magnificent  schemes in the face of so much bitter and violent opposition.
