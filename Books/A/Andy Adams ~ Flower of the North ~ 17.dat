  He was an old man. Beard and hair were white. He was as tall as   Philip; his shoulders were broader; his chest massive; and as he   stood under the light of one of the hanging lamps, his face  shining  with a pale glow, one hand upon his breast, the other  extended, it  seemed to Philip that all of the greatness and past  glory of Fort o'  God, whatever they may have been, were  personified in the man he  beheld. He was dressed in soft buckskin,  like Pierre. His hair and  beard grew in wild disorder, and from  under shaggy eyebrows there  burned a pair of deep-set eyes of the  color of blue steel. He was a  man to inspire awe; old, and yet  young; white-haired, gray-faced, and  yet a giant. One might have  expected from between his bearded lips a  voice as thrilling as his  appearance; a rumbling voice, deep-chested,  sonorous&#8212;and it would  have caused no surprise. It was the voice that  surprised Philip  more than the man. It was low, and trembling with an  agitation  which even strength and pride could not control. 
  &quot;Philip Whittemore, I am Henry d'Arcambal. May God bless you for   what you have done!&quot; 
  A hand of iron gripped his own. And then, before Philip had found   words to say, the master of Fort o' God suddenly placed his arms   about his shoulders and embraced him. Their shoulders touched.  Their  faces were close. The two men who loved Jeanne d'Arcambal  above all  else on earth gazed for a silent moment into each  other's eyes. 
  &quot;They have told me,&quot; said D'Arcambal, softly. &quot;You have brought my   Jeanne home through death. Accept a father's blessing, and with   it&#8212;this!&quot; 
  He stepped back, and swept his arms about the great room. 
  &quot;Everything&#8212;everything&#8212;would have gone with her,&quot; he said. &quot;If   you had let her die, I should have died. My God, what peril she  was  in! In saving her you saved me. So you are welcome here, as a  son. For  the first time since my Jeanne was a babe Fort o' God  offers itself to  a man who is a stranger and its hospitality is  yours so long as its  walls hang together. And as they have done  this for upward of two  hundred years, M'sieur Philip, we may  conclude that our friendship is  to be without end.&quot; 
  He clasped Philip's hands again, and two tears coursed down his   gray cheeks. It was difficult for Philip to restrain the joy his   words produced, which, coming from the lips of Jeanne's father,   lifted him suddenly into a paradise of hope. For many reasons he  had  come to expect a none too warm reception at Fort o' God; he  had looked  ahead to the place with a grim sort of fear, scarcely  definable; and  here Jeanne's father was opening his arms to him.  Pierre was  unapproachable; Jeanne herself was a mystery, filling  him alternately  with hope and despair; D'Arcambal had accepted him  as a son. He could  find no words adequate to his emotion; none  that could describe his  own happiness, unless it was in a bold  avowal of his love for the girl  he had saved. And this his good  sense told him not to make, at the  present moment. 
  &quot;Any man would have done as much for your daughter,&quot; he said at   last, &quot;and I am happy that I was the fortunate one to render her   assistance.&quot; 
  &quot;You are wrong,&quot; said D'Arcambal, taking him by the arm. &quot;You are   one out of a thousand. It takes a MAN to go through the Big  Thunder  and come out at the other end alive. I know of only one  other who has  done that in the last twenty years, and that other  is Henry d'Arcambal  himself. We three, you, Jeanne, and I, have  alone triumphed over those  monsters of death. All others have  died. It seems like a strange  pointing of the hand of God.&quot; 
  Philip trembled. 
  &quot;We three!&quot; he exclaimed. 
  &quot;We three,&quot; said the old man, &quot;and for that reason you are a part   of Fort o' God.&quot; 
  He led Philip deeper into the great room, and Philip saw that   almost all the space along the walls of the huge room was occupied  by  shelves upon shelves of books, masses of papers, piles of  magazines  shoulder-high, scores of maps and paintings. The massive  table was  covered with books; there were piles on smaller tables;  chairs, and  the floor itself, covered with the skins of a score of  wild beasts,  were littered with them. At the far end of the room  he saw deeper and  darker shelves, where gleamed faintly in the  lamplight row upon row of  vials and bottles and strange  instruments of steel and glass. A  scientist in the wilderness&#8212;a  student exiled in a desolation! These  were the thoughts that  leaped into his mind, and he knew that in this  room Jeanne had  been created; that here, between these centuries-old  walls, amid  an environment of strange silence, of whispering age, her  visions  of the world had come. Here, separated from all her kind, God,   Nature, and a father had made her of their handiwork. 
  The old man pointed Philip to a chair near the large table, and   sat down close to him. At his feet was a stool covered with  silvery  lynx-skin, and D'Arcambal looked at this, his strong, grim  face  relaxing into a gentle smile of happiness. 
  &quot;There is where Jeanne sits&#8212;at my feet,&quot; he said. &quot;It has been   her place for many years. When she is not there I am lost. Life   ceases. This room has been our world. To-night you are in Fort o'   God; to-morrow you will see D'Arcambal House. You have heard of  that,  perhaps, but never of Fort o' God. That belongs to Jeanne  and me, to  Pierre&#8212;and you. Fort o' God is the heart, the soul,  the life's blood  of D'Arcambal House. It is this room and two or  three others.  D'Arcambal House is our barrier. When strangers  come, they see  D'Arcambal House; plain rooms, of rough wood;  quarters such as you  have seen at posts and stations; the mask  which gives no hint of what  is hidden within. It is there that we  live to the world; it is here  that we live to ourselves. Jeanne  has my permission to tell you  whatever she wishes, a little later.  But I am curious, and being an  old man must be humored first. I am  still trembling. You must tell me  what happened to Jeanne.&quot; 
  For an hour they talked, and Philip went over one by one the   events as they had occurred since the fight on the cliff, omitting   only such things as he thought that Jeanne and Pierre might wish  to  keep secret to themselves. At the end of that hour he was  certain that  D'Arcambal was unaware of the dark cloud that had  suddenly come into  Jeanne's life. The old man's brow was knitted  with deep lines, and his  powerful jaws were set hard, as Philip  told of the ambush, of the  wounding of Pierre, and the flight of  his assailants with his  daughter. It was to get money, the old man  thought. The half-breed had  suggested that, and Jeanne herself had  given it as her opinion. Why  else should they have been attacked  at Churchill? Such things had  occurred before, he told Philip. The  little daughter of the factor at  Nelson House had been stolen, and  held for ransom. With a hundred  questions he wrung from Philip  every detail of the second fight and of  the struggle for life in  the rapids. He betrayed no physical  excitement, even in those  moments of Philip's description when Jeanne  hung between life and  death; but in his eyes there was the glow of  red-hot fires. At  last there came to interrupt them the low, musical  tinkling of a  bell under the table. 
  D'Arcambal's face lighted up suddenly. 
  &quot;Ah, I had forgotten,&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Pardon me, Philip. Dinner   has been awaiting us this last half-hour; and besides&#8212;&quot; 
  He reached out and touched a tiny button, which Philip had not   observed before. 
  &quot;I am selfish.&quot; 
  He had hardly ceased speaking when footsteps sounded in the hall,   and in spite of every resolution he had made to guard himself  against  any betrayal of the emotions burning in his breast, Philip  sprang to  his feet. Jeanne had come in under the glow of the lamps  and stood now  a dozen feet from him, a vision so exquisitely  lovely that he saw  nothing of those who entered behind her, nor  heard D'Arcambal's low,  happy laugh at his side. It seemed to him  for a moment as if there had  suddenly appeared before him the face  of the picture that was turned  against the wall, only more  beautiful now, radiant with the glow of  living flesh and blood.  But there was something even more startling  than this resemblance.  In this moment Jeanne was the fulfilment of his  dream; she had  come to him from out of another world. She was dressed  in an old-  fashioned gown of pure white, a fabric so delicate that it  seemed  to float about her slender form, responsive to every breath she   drew. Her white shoulders revealed themselves above masses of  filmy  lace that fell upon her bosom; her slender arms, girlish  rather than  womanly in their beauty, were bare. Her hair was bound  up in shining  coils about her head, with a single flower nestling  amid a little  cluster of curls that fell upon her neck. After his  first movement,  Philip recovered himself by a strong effort. He  bowed low to conceal  the flush in his face. Jeanne swept him a  little courtesy, and then  ran past him, with the eagerness of any  modern child, into the  outstretched arms of her father. 
  Laughter and joy rumbled in the beard of the master of Fort o' God   as he looked over Jeanne's head at Philip. 
  &quot;And this is what you have saved for me,&quot; he said. 
  Then he looked beyond, and for the first time Philip realized   there were others in the room. One was Pierre; the other a pretty,   dark-faced girl, with hair that glistened like a raven's wing in  the  lamp-glow. 
  Jeanne left her father's arms and gave her hand to Philip. 
  &quot;M'sieur Philip, this is my sister, Mademoiselle Couchee,&quot; she   cried. 
  Pierre's sister gave Philip her hand, and behind them D'Arcambal   laughed softly in his beard again, and said: 
  &quot;To-morrow, in D'Arcambal House, you may call her Otille, Philip.   But to-night we are in Fort o' God. Oh, Jeanne, Jeanne, what a  witch  you are!&quot; 
  &quot;An angel!&quot; breathed Philip, but no one heard him. 
  &quot;And this witch,&quot; added the old man, &quot;you are to take in to   supper, M'sieur Philip. To night I suppose that I must call you   m'sieur, but to-morrow, when I have on my leather leggings and my   skin cap, I will call you Phil, or Tom, Dick, or Harry, just as I   please. This is the first time, sir, that my Jeanne has ever gone  in  to dinner on another arm than mine or Pierre's. And so I may be  a  little jealous. Proceed.&quot; 
  As Jeanne's hand rested in his arm, and they went into the hall,   Philip could not restrain himself from whispering: 
  &quot;I am glad&#8212;of that.&quot; 
  &quot;And the dress, M'sieur Philip!&quot; exclaimed D'Arcambal behind them,   in the voice of a happy boy. &quot;It is an honor to escort that, to  say  nothing of the silly girl that's in it. That dress, sir,  belonged to a  beautiful lady who was called Camille, and who died  over a century  ago.&quot; 
  &quot;Father, please do be good!&quot; protested Jeanne. &quot;Remember!&quot; 
  &quot;Ah, so I will,&quot; said her father. &quot;I had forgotten that you were   to tell M'sieur Philip these things.&quot; 
  They entered another room illuminated by a single huge lamp   suspended above a table spread with silver and fine linen. The  room  was as great a surprise as the other two had been. It  contained no  chairs. What Philip mentally designated as benches,  with deep cushion  seats of greenish leather, were arranged about  the table. These same  curious seats furnished other parts of the  room. From the pictures on  the walls to the ancient helmet and  cuirass that stood up like a  legless sentinel in one corner, this  room, like the others, breathed  of extreme age. Over a big open  fireplace, in which half a dozen birch  logs were burning, hung a  number of old-fashioned weapons; a  flintlock, a pair of obsolete  French dueling pistols, a short rapier  similar to that which  Pierre wore, and two long swords. Philip noticed  that about each  of the dueling pistols was tied a bow of ribbon, dull  and faded,  as though the passing of generations had robbed them of  beauty and  color, to be replaced by the somberness of age. 
  During the meal Philip could not but observe that Jeanne was   laboring under some mysterious strain. Her cheeks were brilliantly   flushed, and her eyes were filled with a lustrous brightness that  he  had never seen in them before. Their beauty was almost  feverish.  Several times he caught a strange little tremor of her  white  shoulders, as though a sudden chill had passed through her.  He  discovered, too, that Pierre was observing these things, and  that  there was something forced in the half-breed's cheerfulness.  But  D'Arcambal and Otille seemed completely oblivious of any  change. Their  happiness overflowed. Philip thought of his last  supper at Churchill,  with Eileen Brokaw and her father. Miss  Brokaw had acted strangely  then, and had struggled to hide some  secret grief or excitement, as  Jeanne was struggling now. 
  He was glad when the meal was finished, and the master of Fort o'   God rose from his seat. At D'Arcambal's movement his eyes caught   Jeanne's, and then he saw that Pierre was looking sharply at him. 
  &quot;Jeanne owes you an apology&#8212;and an explanation, M'sieur Philip,&quot;   said D'Arcambal, resting a hand upon Jeanne's head. &quot;We are going  to  retire, and she will initiate you into the fold of Fort o'  God.&quot; 
  Pierre and Otille followed him from the room. For the first time   in an hour Jeanne laughed frankly at Philip. 
  &quot;There isn't much to explain, M'sieur Philip,&quot; she said, rising   from her seat. &quot;You know pretty nearly all there is to know about   Fort o' God now. Only I am sure that I did not appear to value  your  confidence very much&#8212;a little while ago. It must have seemed   ungrateful in me, indeed, to have told you so little about myself  and  my home, after what you did for Pierre and me. But I have  father's  permission now. It is the second time that he has ever  given it to  me.&quot; 
  &quot;And I don't want to hear,&quot; exclaimed Philip, bluntly. &quot;I have   been more or less of a brute, Miss Jeanne. I know enough about  Fort  o' God. It is a glorious place. You owe me nothing, and for  that  reason&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;But I insist,&quot; interrupted the girl. &quot;Do you mean to say that you   do not care to listen, when this is the second time in my life  that I  have had the opportunity of talking about my home? And the   first&#8212;didn't give me any pleasure. This will.&quot; 
  A shadow came into Jeanne's eyes. She motioned him to a seat   beside her in front of the fire. Her nearness, the touch of her   dress, the sweet perfume of her presence, thrilled him. He felt  that  the moment was near when the whole world as he knew it was to  slip  away from him, leaving him in a paradise, or a chaos of  despair.  Jeanne looked up at the dueling pistols. The firelight  trembled in the  soft folds of lace over her bosom; it glistened in  her hair, and  lighted her face with a gentle glow. 
  &quot;There isn't much to explain,&quot; she said again, in a voice so low   that it was hardly more than a whisper. &quot;But what little there is  I  want you to know, so that when you go away you will understand.  More  than two hundred years ago a band of gentlemen adventurers  were sent  over into this country by Prince Rupert to form the  Hudson's Bay  Company. That is history, and you know more of it,  probably, than I.  One of these men was Le Chevalier Grosellier.  One summer he came up  the Churchill, and stopped at the great rock  on which we saw the sun  setting to-night, and which was called the  Sun Rock by the Indians. He  was struck by the beauty of the place,  and when he went back to France  it was with the plan of returning  to build himself a chateau in the  wilderness. Two or three years  later he did this, and called the place  Fort o' God. For more than  a century, M'sieur, Fort o' God was a place  of revel and pleasure  in the heart of this desolation. Early in the  nineteenth century  it passed into the hands of a man by the name of  D'Arcy, and it is  said that at one time it housed twenty gentlemen and  as many  ladies of France for one whole season. Its history is obscure,  and  mostly lost. But for a long time after D'Arcy came it was a place   of adventure, of pleasure, and of mystery, very little of which   remains to-day. Those are his pistols above the fire. He was  killed  by one of them out there beside the big rock, in a quarrel  with one of  his guests over a woman. We think&#8212;here&#8212;from letters  that we have  found, that her name was Camille. There is a chest in  my room filled  with linen that bears her name. This dress came  from that chest. I  have to be careful of them, as they tear very  easily. After D'Arcy the  place was almost forgotten and remained  so until nearly forty years  ago when my father came into  possession of it. That, M'sieur, is the  very simple story of Fort  o' God. Its old name is forgotten. It lives  only with us. Others  know it as D'Arcambal House.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I have heard of that,&quot; said Philip. 
  He waited for Jeanne, and saw that her fingers were nervously   twisting a bit of ribbon in her lap. 
  &quot;Of course, that is uninteresting,&quot; she continued. &quot;You can almost   guess the rest. We have lived here&#8212;alone. Not one of us has ever   felt the desire to leave this little world of ours. It is curious   &#8212;you may scarcely believe what I say&#8212;but it is true that we look   out upon your big world and laugh at it and dislike it. I guess&#8212;   that I have been taught to hate it&#8212;since I can remember.&quot; 
  There was a little tremble in Jeanne's voice, an instant's   quivering of her chin. Philip looked from her face into the fire,  and  stared hard, choking back words which were ready to burst from  his  lips. In place of them he said, with a touch of bitterness in  his  voice: 
  &quot;And I have grown to hate my world, Jeanne. It has compelled me to   hate it. That is why I spoke to you that night on the cliff at   Churchill.&quot; 
  &quot;I have sometimes thought that I have been very wrong,&quot; said the   girl. &quot;I have never seen this other world. I know nothing of it,   except as I have been taught. I have no right to hate it, and yet  I  do. I have never wanted to see it. I have never cared to know  the  people who lived in it. I wish that I could understand, but I  cannot;  except that father has made for us, for Pierre and Otille  and me, this  little world at Fort o' God, and has taught us to  fear the other. I  know that there is no other man in the whole  world like my father, and  that what he has done must be best. It  is his pride that we bring your  world to our doors, but that we  never go to it; he says that we know  more about that world than  the people who live there, which of course  cannot be so. And so we  have grown up amid the old memories, the  pictures, and the dead  romances of Fort o' God. We have taken pleasure  in living as we  do&#8212;in making for ourselves our own little social  codes, our  childish aristocracy, our make-believe world. It is the  spirit of  Fort o' God that lives with us, and makes us content; the  shadow-  faces of men and women who once filled these rooms with life  and  pleasure, and whose memory seems to have passed into our keeping   alone. I know them all; many of their names, all of their faces. I   have a daguerreotype of Camille Poitiers, and she must have been  very  beautiful. There are the tiniest slippers in the world in her  chest,  and ribbons like those which are tied about the pistols.  There is a  painting of D'Arcy in your room. It is the picture next  to the one  that has its face turned to the wall.&quot; 
  She rose to her feet, and Philip stood beside her. There was a   mist in her eyes as she held out her hand to him. 
  &quot;I&#8212;I&#8212;would like to have you&#8212;see that picture,&quot; she whispered. 
  Philip could not speak. He held the hand Jeanne had given him as   they passed through the long, dimly lighted halls. At the open  door  to his room they stopped, and he could feel Jeanne trembling. 
  &quot;You will tell me&#8212;the truth?&quot; she begged, like a child. &quot;You will   tell me what you think&#8212;of the picture?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  She went in ahead of him and turned the frame so that the face in   the picture smiled down upon them in all of its luring loveliness.   There was something pathetic in the girl's attitude now. She stood   under the picture, facing Philip, and there was a tense eagerness  in  her eyes, a light that was almost supplication, a crying out of  her  soul to him in a breathless moment that seemed hovering  between pain  and joy. It was Jeanne, an older Jeanne, that looked  from out of the  picture, smiling, inviting admiration, bewildering  hi her beauty; it  was Jeanne, the child, waiting for him in flesh  and blood to speak,  her eyes big and dark, her breath coming  quickly, her hands buried in  the deep lace on her bosom. A low  word came to Philip's lips, and then  he laughed softly. It was a  laugh, almost under his breath, which  sweeps up now and then from  a soul in a joy&#8212;an emotion&#8212;which is  unutterable in words. But to  Jeanne it was different. Her dark eyes  grew hurt and wounded, two  great tears ran down her paling cheeks, and  suddenly she buried  her face in her hands and with a sobbing cry  turned from him, with  her head bowed under the smiling face above. 
  &quot;And you&#8212;you hate it, too!&quot; she sobbed. &quot;They all hate it&#8212;   Pierre&#8212;father&#8212;all&#8212;all hate it. It must&#8212;it must be bad. They  hate  her&#8212;every one&#8212;but me. And&#8212;I love her so!&quot; 
  Her slender form shook with sobs. For a moment Philip stood like   one struck dumb. Then he sprang to her and caught her close in his   arms. 
  &quot;Jeanne&#8212;Jeanne&#8212;listen,&quot; he cried. &quot;To-night I looked at that   picture before I went to see your father, and I loved it because  it  is like you. Jeanne, my darling, I love you&#8212;I love you&#8212;&quot; 
  She was panting against his breast. He covered her face with   kisses. Her sweet lips were not turned from him, and there filled  her  eyes a sudden light that made him almost sob in his happiness. 
  &quot;I love you, I love you,&quot; he repeated, again and again, and he   could find no other words than those. 
  For an instant her arms clung about his shoulders, and then,   suddenly, they strained against him, and she tore herself free,  and,  with a cry so pathetic that it seemed as though her heart had  broken  in that moment, she fled from him, and out of the room.
