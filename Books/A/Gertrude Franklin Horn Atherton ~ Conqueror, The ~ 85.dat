But if Hamilton consigned politics to oblivion at midnight and slept for  the few hours demanded by outraged nature, he plunged from the crystal  of his bath into their reeking blackness early in the morning. He had  laughed the night before, but he was in the worst of tempers as he shut  his study door behind him. For the first time in his life he was on a  battle-ground with no sensation of joy in the coming fight. The business  was too ugly and the prospect was almost certain defeat. Were the first  battle lost, he knew that a sharper engagement would immediately  succeed: his political foresight anticipated the tie, and he alone had a  consummate knowledge of the character of Burr. That the Republicans  would offer Burr the office of Vice-President was as positive as that  Jefferson would be their first and unanimous choice. Clinton and  Chancellor Livingston might be more distinguished men than the little  politician, but the first was in open opposition to Jefferson, and the  second was deaf. Burr's conquest of New York entitled him to reward, and  he would accept it and intrigue with every resource of his cunning and  address for the larger number of votes, regardless of the will of the  people. If the result were a tie, the Federals would incline to anybody  rather than Jefferson, and Hamilton would be obliged to throw into the  scale his great influence as leader of his party for the benefit of the  man he would gladly have attached to a fork and set to toast above the  coals of Hell. He had no score to settle with Burr, but to permit him to  become President of the United States would be a crime for which the  leader of the Federalist party would be held responsible. When the  inevitable moment came he should hand over the structure he had created  to the man who had desired to rend it from gable to foundation; both  because it was the will of the people and because Jefferson was the  safer man of the two.    
So far his statesmanship triumphed, as it had done in every crisis which  he had been called upon to manipulate, and as it would in many more.  But for once, and as regarded the first battle, it failed him, and he  made no attempt to invoke it. This was the blackest period of his inner  life, and there were times when he never expected to emerge from its  depths. The threatened loss of the magnificent power he had wielded, the  hatreds that possessed and overwhelmed him, the seeming futility of  almost a lifetime of labour, sacrifices without end and prodigal  dispensing of great gifts, the constant insults of his enemies, and the  public ingratitude, had saturated his spirit with a raging bitterness  and roused the deadliest passions of his nature. The marah he had passed  through while a member of the Cabinet was shallow compared to the depths  in which he almost strangled to-day. Not only was this the final  accumulation, but the inspiring and sustaining affection, the  circumscribing bulwark, of Washington was gone from him. "He was an  Aegis very essential to me," he had said sadly, and he felt his loss  more every day that he lived.    
He knew there was just one chance to save the Presidency to the  Federalist party. Did he employ the magic of his pen to recreate the  popularity of John Adams, it was more than possible that thousands would  gladly permit the leader they had followed for years to persuade them  they had judged too hastily the man of whom they had expected too much.  But by this time there was one man Hamilton hated more implacably than  Jefferson, and that was John Adams. Besides the thorough disapproval of  the Administration of Adams, which, as a statesman, he shared with all  the eminent Federals in the country, his personal counts with this enemy  piled to heaven. Adams had severed the party he had created, endeavoured  to humiliate him before the country, refused, after Washington's death,  to elevate him to his rightful position as General-in-chief of the army  he had organized, alienated from him one of the best of his friends, and  primarily was answerable for the crushing defeat of yesterday. With one  of the Pinckneys at the helm, Hamilton could have defied Jefferson and  kept the Democrats out of power; but the man next in eminence to himself  in his own party had given his supremacy its death-blow, and it is  little wonder if his depths resembled boiling pitch, if the heights of  his character had disappeared from his vision. He was, above all things,  intensely human, with all good and all evil in him; and although he  conquered himself at no very remote period, he felt, at the present  moment, like Lucifer whirling through space.    
Troup, now a retired judge of the U.S. District Court of New York, and a  man of some fortune, ready as of old to be Hamilton's faithful  lieutenant, entered and looked with sympathy and more apprehension at  his Chief.    
"I've not come to bemoan this bad business," he said, sitting down at a  desk and taking up his pen. "What next? It looks hopeless, but of course  you'll no more cease from effort than one of your Scotch ancestors would  have laid down his arms if a rival chieftain had appeared on the warpath  with the world at his back. Is it Adams and C.C.P. to the death?"    
"It is Pinckney; Adams only in so far as he is useful. He still has his  following in the New England States. The leaders in those States, first  and second, must be persuaded to work unanimously for Adams and  Pinckney, with the distinct understanding that in other States votes for  Adams will be thrown away. This, after I have persuaded them of Adams's  absolute unfitness for office. If we carry and it comes to a tie, there  is no doubt to whom the House will give the election."    
Troup whistled. "This is politics!" he said. "I never believed you'd go  down to your neck. I wish you'd throw the whole thing over, and retire  to private life."    
"I shall retire soon enough," said Hamilton, grimly. "But Adams will go  first."    
Troup knew that it was useless to remonstrate further. He had followed  this Captain to the bitter end too often. Underneath the immense sanity  of Hamilton's mind was a curious warp of obstinacy, born of  implacability and developed far beyond the normal bounds of  determination. When this almost perverted faculty was in possession of  the brain, Hamilton would pursue his object, did every guardian in his  genius, from foresight to acuteness, rise in warning. His present  policy if a failure might be the death of the Federalist party, but the  flashing presentiment of that historic disaster did not deter him for a  moment.    
"It is the time for politics," Hamilton continued. "Statesmanship goes  begging. I shall be entirely frank about it, for that matter. There will  be no underhand scheming, Adams is welcome to know every step I take.  The correspondence must begin at once. I'll make out a list for you. I  shall begin with Wolcott."
