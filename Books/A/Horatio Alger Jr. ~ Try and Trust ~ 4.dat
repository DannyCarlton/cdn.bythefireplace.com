  It was a week later when an incident befell Herbert which is worthy  of  mention, since it brought him into collision with a man who was  destined  to have some influence over his future life. 
  A neighboring farmer, for whom, during his mother's life, he had   occasionally gone on errands, drove up in front of the doctor's house,   and asked Herbert if he could take his horse and wagon and drive over  to  the mill village to get some corn ground. Herbert was rather glad  to  accept this proposal, not only because he was to receive  twenty-five  cents for so doing, but also because he was fond of  driving a horse. 
  He was only about a mile from the mill village, when he saw  approaching  him a man in a light open buggy. Herbert knew every horse  in Waverley,  and every man, woman, and child, for that matter, and he  perceived at  once that the driver was a stranger. To tell the truth,  he was not very  favorably impressed by his appearance. The man was  very dark, with black  hair and an unshaven beard of three days'  growth, which did not set off  his irregular and repulsive features.  His mouth, partly open, revealed  several yellow tusks, stained with  tobacco juice. On his head he wore a  broad-brimmed straw hat, rather  the worse for wear. 
  It so happened that just at this point the middle of the road was  much  better than the sides, which sloped considerably, terminating in  gullies  which were partly full from the recent rains. The road was  narrow, being  wide enough for two vehicles to pass each other, if each  veered to the  side, but not otherwise. 
  Herbert observed that the buggy, which was now rapidly approaching,  was  kept in the center of the road, and that the driver appeared to  have no  intention of turning out. 
  &quot;What does he mean?&quot; thought our hero. &quot;He cannot expect me to do  the  whole of the turning out. I will turn out my half, and if he wants  to  get by, he must do the same.&quot; 
  Accordingly, he turned partially to one side, as much as could be   reasonably expected, and quietly awaited the approach of the man in  the  buggy. The latter still kept the center of the road, and did not  turn  out his carriage at all. As soon as it was close at hand, the  driver  leaned forward and exclaimed angrily: 
  &quot;Turn out, boy!&quot; 
  If he expected that Herbert would be intimidated by his tone he was  much  mistaken. Our hero was bold, and not easily frightened. He looked   quietly in the man's face, and said composedly, &quot;I have turned out.&quot; 
  &quot;Then turn out more, you young vagabond! Do you hear me?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir, I hear you, and should if you didn't speak half so  loud.&quot; 
  &quot;Curse your impudence! I tell you, turn out more!&quot; exclaimed the   stranger, becoming more and more angry. He had expected to get his own   way without trouble. If Herbert had been a man, he would not have been   so unreasonable; but he supposed he could browbeat a boy into doing   whatever he chose to dictate. But he had met his match, as it turned   out. 
  &quot;I have already given you half the road,&quot; said Herbert, firmly,  &quot;and I  don't intend to give you any more.&quot; 
  &quot;You don't, eh? Young man, how old are you?&quot; 
  &quot;I am fourteen.&quot; 
  &quot;I should think you were forty by the airs you put on.&quot; 
  &quot;Is it putting on airs to insist on my rights?&quot; asked our hero. 
  &quot;Your rights!&quot; retorted the other, laughing contemptuously. 
  &quot;Yes, my rights,&quot; returned Herbert, quietly. &quot;I have a right to  half of  the road, and I have taken it. If I turn out any more, I shall  go into  the gully.&quot; 
  &quot;That makes no difference. A wetting won't do you any harm. Your   impudence needs cooling.&quot; 
  &quot;That may be,&quot; said Herbert, who did not choose to get angry, but  was  resolved to maintain his rights; &quot;but I object to the wetting, for  all  that, and as this wagon is not mine, I do not choose to upset it.&quot; 
  &quot;You are the most insolent young scamp I ever came across!&quot;  exclaimed  the other, furiously. &quot;I've a good mind to give you  something much worse  than a wetting.&quot; 
  &quot;Such as what?&quot; asked our hero, coolly. In reply the man flourished  his  whip significantly. &quot;Do you see that?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Yes.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, very well,&quot; said the other, ironically; &quot;I'm glad you do.  Perhaps  you wouldn't like to feel it?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I don't think I should,&quot; said Herbert, not exhibiting the  least  apprehension. 
  The stranger handled his whip, eyeing our hero viciously at the  same  time, as if it would have afforded him uncommon pleasure to lay  it over  his back. But there was something in the look of our hero  which  unconsciously cowed him, and, much as he wished to strike him,  he held  back. 
  &quot;Well, you're a cool hand,&quot; he said, after a moment's hesitation. 
  To this our hero did not see fit to make any reply. But he grasped  his  own whip a little tighter. So brutal had been the tone assumed by  the  stranger, that he was not sure but he might proceed to carry out  his  threat, and lay the whip over his back. He determined, in that  case, to  give him as good as he sent. I will not express any opinion  as to the  propriety of this determination, but I am certain, from what  I know of  our hero's fearless spirit, that he would not have hesitated  to do it,  be the consequences what they might. But he did not have the   opportunity. 
  &quot;Once more,&quot; demanded the stranger, furiously; &quot;are you going to  turn  out?&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said the boy, decidedly. 
  &quot;Then&#8212;I'll run you down.&quot; 
  So saying, he brought the whip violently on the horse's back. The  latter  gave a convulsive spring forward. But his driver had not taken  into  consideration that the farm-wagon was the stronger of the two  vehicles,  and that in any collision the buggy must come off second  best. So it  happened that a wheel of the buggy was broken, and the  driver, in the  shock, thrown sprawling into a puddle on the other side  of the road. The  wagon suffered no damage, but the old horse,  terrified, set off at a  rapid pace. Herbert looked back to see if the  stranger was injured, but  seeing that he had already picked himself up  unwounded, but decidedly  dirty, he concluded to keep on his way to the  mill. 
  The driver of the overturned vehicle was considerably more angry  than  hurt at this catastrophe. 
  It chafed his pride not a little to think that, after all his  vaunts,  the boy had maintained his ground, and got the better of him.  For a man  of forty-five to be worsted by a boy of fourteen was, it  must be  confessed, a little mortifying. It was something like a great  ship of  the line being compelled to surrender to a little monitor. 
  No one feels particularly dignified or good-natured when he is  picking  himself out of a mud puddle. Our black-haired acquaintance  proved no  exception to this remark. He shook his fist at the receding  wagon and  its occupant&#8212;a demonstration of defiance which our hero did  not  witness, his back being now turned to his late opponent. 
  Mr. Abner Holden&#8212;for this was the stranger's name&#8212;next turned his   attention to the buggy, which had been damaged to some extent, and so   was likely to involve him in expense. This was another uncomfortable   reflection. Meanwhile, as it was no longer in a fit state for travel,  he  must contrive some way to have it carried back to the stable, and,   unless he could procure another vehicle, perform the rest of the  journey  on foot. 
  Luckily, some men in a neighboring field had witnessed the  collision,  and, supposing their services might be required, were now  present to  lend their aid. 
  &quot;Pretty bad accident,&quot; remarked one of them. &quot;That 'ere wheel'll  need  considerable tinkering afore it's fit for use. How came you to  get it  broke so, squire?&quot; 
  &quot;A little rascal had the impudence to dispute the road with me, and   would not turn out at my bidding,&quot; said Mr. Holden, in a tone of   exasperation, which showed that his temper had been considerably  soured  by the accident. 
  &quot;Wouldn't turn out? Seems to me from the marks of the wheels, you  must  have been drivin' along in the middle of the road. I guess you  didn't  take the trouble to turn out, yourself.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, there was room enough for the boy to turn out one side,&quot;  said  Holden, doggedly. 
  &quot;You are slightly mistaken, stranger,&quot; said the other, who was  disgusted  at the traveler's unreasonableness. &quot;There wasn't room; as  anyone can  see that's got eyes in his head. Didn't the youngster turn  out at all?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; snapped Holden, not relishing the other's free speech. 
  &quot;Then it seems you were the one that would not turn out. If you had  been  a leetle more accommodating, this accident couldn't have  happened. Fair  play's my motto. If a feller meets you halfway, it's  all you have a  right to expect. I reckon it'll cost you a matter of  ten dollars to get  that 'ere buggy fixed.&quot; 
  Holden looked savagely at the broken wheel, but that didn't mend   matters. He would have answered the countryman angrily, but, as he  stood  in need of assistance, this was not good policy. 
  &quot;What would you advise me to do about it?&quot; he inquired. 
  &quot;You will have to leave the buggy where it is just now. Where did  you  get it?&quot; 
  &quot;Over at the mill village.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, you'd better lead the horse back&#8212;'tain't more'n a mile or  so&#8212;  get another wagon, and tell 'em to send for this.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, perhaps that is the best way.&quot; 
  &quot;Where was you goin'?&quot; 
  &quot;Over to Waverley.&quot; 
  &quot;That's where the boy came from.&quot; 
  &quot;What boy?&quot; 
  &quot;The boy that upset you.&quot; 
  &quot;What is his name?&quot; asked Abner Holden, scowling. 
  &quot;His name is Herbert Mason, son of the Widder Mason that died two  or  three weeks since. Poor boy, he's left alone in the world.&quot; 
  &quot;Where's he stopping?&quot; asked Holden, hardly knowing why he asked  the  question. 
  &quot;Dr. Kent took him in after the funeral, so I heard; but the  selectmen  of Waverley are trying to find him a place somewheres, where  he can earn  his own livin'. He's a smart, capable boy, and I guess he  can do 'most a  man's work.&quot; 
  Abner Holden looked thoughtful. Some plan had suggested itself to  him  which appeared to yield him satisfaction, for he began to look  decidedly  more comfortable, and he muttered to himself: &quot;I'll be even  with him  YET. See if I don't.&quot; 
  &quot;How far am I from Waverley?&quot; he asked, after a slight pause. 
  &quot;Well, risin' three miles,&quot; drawled the other. 
  &quot;If I could get somebody to go back with this horse, I don't know  but  what I'd walk to Waverley. Are you very busy?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I don't know but I could leave off for a short time,&quot; said  the  other, cautiously. &quot;Work's pretty drivin', to be sure. What do you   cal'late to pay?&quot; 
  &quot;How much would it be worth?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, there's the walk there and back, and then again there's the   time.&quot; 
  &quot;You can mount the horse going.&quot; 
  &quot;I guess fifty cents'll about pay me.&quot; 
  Mr. Holden took out his pocketbook and paid the required sum. 
  &quot;By the way,&quot; he said, as if incidentally, &quot;who is the chairman of  the  selectmen in the village of Waverley?&quot; &quot;You ain't thinkin' of  takin'  that boy, be you?&quot; said the other, curiously. 
  &quot;I've had enough to do with him; I don't want ever to lay eyes on  him  again.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I dunno as I should, if I was you,&quot; said the countryman,  rather  slyly. 
  &quot;You haven't answered my question yet,&quot; said Holden, impatiently. 
  &quot;Oh, about the cheerman of the selectmen. It's Captain Joseph  Ross.&quot; 
  &quot;Where does he live?&quot; 
  &quot;A leetle this side of the village. You'll know the house, well  enough.  It's a large, square house painted white, with a well-sweep in  front.&quot; 
  Without a word of thanks for the information, Abner Holden turned,  and  began to walk toward Waverley. Perhaps his object in making these   inquiries has been guessed. It happened that he needed a boy, and, for   more reasons than one, he thought he should like to have Herbert bound   to him. Herbert, as he had noticed, was a stout boy, and he probably   could get a good deal of work out of him. Then, again, it would be   gratifying to him to have our hero in subjection to him. He could pay   him off then, ten times over, for his insolence, as he chose to term  it. 
  &quot;I'll break his proud spirit,&quot; thought Abner Holden. &quot;He'll find  he's  got a master, if I get hold of him. He don't know me yet, but he  will  some time.&quot; 
  Mr. Holden resolved to wait on Captain Ross at once, and conclude   arrangements with him to take Herbert before our hero had returned  from  the mill village. He pictured, with a grim smile, Herbert's  dismay when  he learned who was to be his future master. 
  With the help of a handkerchief dipped into a crystal stream at the   roadside, Abner Holden succeeded in effacing some of the muddy stains   upon his coat and pantaloons, and at length got himself into  presentable  trim for calling upon a &quot;selectman.&quot; 
  At length he came in sight of the house which had been described to  him  as that of Captain Ross. There was a woman at the well-sweep  engaged in  drawing water. 
  &quot;Does Captain Ross live here?&quot; he inquired. 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Is he at home?&quot; 
  &quot;He's over in the three-acre lot. Was you wantin' to see him?&quot; 
  &quot;I should like to. Is the field far away?&quot; 
  &quot;No, it's just behind the house.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I guess I'll go and find him. I want to see him on a little  matter  of business.&quot; 
  Mr. Holden crossed a mowing-field, and then, climbing over a stone  wall,  found himself at the edge of the three-acre lot. The captain was   superintending one or two hired men, and, as he had his coat off, had   probably been assisting them. 
  &quot;Captain Ross?&quot; said Abner Holden, interrogatively. 
  &quot;That's my name.&quot; 
  &quot;You are chairman of the selectmen, I believe?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;I understand that you have a boy that you want to bind out.&quot; 
  &quot;I reckon you mean Herbert Mason.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I believe that's the name I heard.&quot; 
  &quot;Are you in want of a boy?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, I am looking out for one.&quot; 
  &quot;What is your business?&quot; 
  &quot;I keep a store, but I should want him to work on land part of the   time.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you live hereabouts?&quot; 
  &quot;Over at Cranston.&quot; 
  &quot;If you'll come to the house, we'll talk the matter over. The boy's  a  good boy, and we want to get a good place for him. His mother was a   widder, and he's her only son. He's a smart, capable lad, and good to   work.&quot; 
  &quot;I've no doubt he'll suit me. I'll take him on your  recommendation.&quot; 
  &quot;We should want him to go to school winters. He's a pretty good  scholar  already. His father was a larned man, and used to teach him  before he  died. If he had lived, I reckon Herbert would certainly have  gone to  college.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll agree to send him to school in the winter for the next two  years,&quot;  said Holden, &quot;and will give him board and clothes, and when  he's twenty-  one a freedom suit, and a hundred dollars. Will that do?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't know but that's reasonable,&quot; said Captain Ross, slowly.  &quot;The  boy's a bit high-spirited, but if you manage him right, I guess  you'll  like him.&quot; 
  &quot;I'll manage him!&quot; thought Abner Holden. &quot;Can I take him with me  to-  morrow?&quot; he asked. &quot;I don't come this way very often.&quot; 
  &quot;Well, I guess that can be arranged. We'll go over to Dr. Kent's  after  dinner, and see if they can get him ready.&quot; 
  &quot;In the meantime,&quot; said Holden, afraid that the prize might slip  through  his fingers, &quot;suppose we make out the papers. I suppose you  have full  authority in the matter.&quot; 
  Captain Ross had no objection, and thus poor Herbert was  unconsciously  delivered over to the tender mercies of a man who had  very little love  for him.
