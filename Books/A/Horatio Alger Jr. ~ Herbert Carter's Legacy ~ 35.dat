  The weeks slipped rapidly away. Herbert succeeded in maintaining   himself at his new business, and never failed to have ready the four   dollars which he had agreed to pay for board. It was lucky he did, for   he soon found that there would be no chance of borrowing from his   roommate. Cornelius was always hard up. As he only paid a dollar more   board than Herbert, the latter wondered what he did with his twenty   dollars a week. But the fact was, Mr. Dixon at present received but   half that sum, though pride induced him to represent otherwise. And   what, I ask, are ten dollars a week to a young man of fashionable   tastes? No wonder he was always short of funds. How could it be   otherwise? 
  Of course it was satisfactory to Herbert to feel that he was paying   his way. But still he had a source of anxiety. He felt that he ought&#8212;   indeed, it was absolutely necessary&#8212;to contribute to his mother's   support. Moreover, the dreaded day on which the semi-annual interest   came due was now close at hand. So far as he could judge, his mother   would have nothing to meet it. It seemed inevitable that she should   submit to the squire's demand, and sacrifice the house. It was a sad   thing to think of, yet there was this consolation: the three or four   hundred dollars cash which the squire would pay would tide over the   next year or two, until Herbert was older and could earn more. 
  But, after all, was it certain that he would earn more? Could he  sell  more papers two years hence than now? That was hardly likely. If  he  wanted to advance his income, it must be in some other business.  Yet,  to a boy situated as he was, there was little chance of getting  any  employment that would make as good immediate returns as selling   papers. 
  So, thinking over these things, our hero was much perplexed, and  could  see no way out of the difficulty. He had never read &#8220;David   Copperfield,&#8221; and had not accustomed himself to expecting something to   turn up. He was sensible enough, indeed, to know that it is idle to   wait for such chances. Yet, when one does his duty faithfully, things   will occasionally turn up, and this was precisely what happened to   Herbert. 
  He was standing at his accustomed post one day, when a pleasant-   looking gentleman of fifty, or perhaps a little more, accosted him,   inquiring for a particular morning paper. 
  &#8220;I haven't got it, sir; but I will get you one,&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Will you be long?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, sir; I know where I can get one at once.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Very well, then, I will wait here till you return.&#8221; 
  Herbert was as good as his word. As the gentleman paid him, he  asked,  pleasantly: &#8220;How is business, my young friend?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Pretty good, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Can you make money enough to support yourself?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then I suppose you are contented?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should be, sir, if I had only myself to look after.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You haven't a wife and family, I presume,&#8221; said the gentleman,   smiling. 
  Herbert laughed. 
  &#8220;I hope not yet, sir,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But I have a mother whom I  ought  to assist.&#8221; 
  &#8220;And you cannot?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I have not been able to yet. It takes all I can earn to pay my own   expenses.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Does your mother live in the city?&#8221; 
  &#8220;No, sir; in the town of Wrayburn, fifty or sixty miles from here.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Wrayburn?&#8221; repeated the gentleman, in surprise. 
  &#8220;Yes, sir; it is a small village. I dare say you never heard of  it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But I have heard of it. My son passed a few weeks there during the   last summer.&#8221; 
  It was Herbert's turn to be surprised. He examined the gentleman's   face attentively, and it dawned upon him who he was. 
  &#8220;Are you Mr. Cameron?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;How is it that you know me?&#8221; inquired the other. 
  &#8220;My name is Herbert Carter. I was employed to read to your son.  Have  you heard from him?&#8221; 
  &#8220;We are expecting a letter daily, but the distance is considerable,   and we may have to wait for some time yet. So you are Herbert Carter?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My son was very much interested in you. He has spoken often of  you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;He was very kind to me.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Your father was an inventor.&#8221; 
  &#8220;That was not his business, but he devoted his leisure to  invention.&#8221; 
  &#8220;My son placed in my hands, for examination, a model of his, just   before he went away.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Have you examined it? What do you think of it, sir?&#8221; asked  Herbert,  eagerly. 
  &#8220;I only recently returned from Europe, and have not thoroughly   examined it. So far as I have done so, I am inclined to think   favorably of it.&#8221; 
  Herbert's heart bounded with hope. 
  &#8220;Do you think we can get anything for it?&#8221; he asked. 
  &#8220;I think you can. Indeed, if further examination bears out my first   favorable impressions, I will myself make you an offer for it.&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should be so glad, for mother's sake!&#8221; exclaimed Herbert. 
  &#8220;My young friend,&#8221; said Mr. Cameron, &#8220;I like your feeling toward  your  mother. I sincerely hope I may be able to make you a satisfactory   offer. By the way, how are you situated? Can you leave the city this   afternoon?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then come home with me. You shall be my guest for a week. During  that  time we will examine and decide about the model.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Thank you, sir; you are very kind,&#8221; said Herbert, hesitating. 
  &#8220;What makes you hesitate?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I am afraid I don't look fit to visit a gentleman's family.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, never mind that,&#8221; said Mr. Cameron, heartily. &#8220;We are plain   people, and don't value fine dress.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Will there be time for me to go home first?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Yes; you can meet me two hours hence at the St. Nicholas Hotel. I   occupy Room 121. On second thoughts, you may as well wait for me in   the reading room.&#8221; 
  &#8220;All right, sir.&#8221; 
  Herbert hurried home, arrayed himself in clean clothes, put up a  small  bundle of necessary articles, and in an hour and a half was at  the  hotel awaiting Mr. Cameron. He left a note for Cornelius Dixon,   explaining that he was called out of the city for a few days, but   would write soon. He did not enter into details, for he was not at all   certain that things would turn out as he hoped. 
  Mr. Cameron lived in a substantial country house, with a fine  garden  attached. Nothing was wanting of comfort in his hospitable  home, but  he avoided show and ostentation. To Herbert was assigned a  large,  well-furnished chamber, the best he had ever occupied, and he  was made  to feel at home. The next day he accompanied Mr. Cameron to  the  manufactory, which he found to be a scene of busy industry,  employing  three hundred hands. 
  &#8220;I shall be busy to-day; but to-night I will look at your father's   model,&#8221; said the manufacturer. &#8220;Probably it will be three or four days   before I can come to any decision.&#8221; 
  Herbert passed his time pleasantly for the next three or four days.   Yet he could not avoid feeling anxious. Interest day was close at   hand, and his hopes might end in failure. 
  On the fourth day Mr. Cameron said to him: &#8220;Well, Herbert, I have  made  up my mind about your father's invention.&#8221; 
  Herbert's suspense was great. His heart almost stopped beating. 
  The manufacturer went on: 
  &#8220;I consider it practicable, and am disposed to make you an offer  for  it. Are you authorized to conclude terms?&#8221; 
  &#8220;My mother will agree to anything I propose, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Then this is my offer. The model must be patented at once. I will  see  to that. Then make over to me half the invention, and I will agree  to  pay you and your mother one thousand dollars a year for the next  ten  years.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Are you in earnest?&#8221; gasped Herbert. 
  &#8220;Entirely so,&#8221; said Mr. Cameron. &#8220;Will that satisfy you?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I would have accepted a quarter of the sum you offer, sir.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Better not tell me that,&#8221; said Mr. Cameron, smiling. &#8220;I might take   advantage of it. Will you consider it a bargain, then?&#8221; 
  &#8220;Oh, how happy my mother will be!&#8221; said Herbert. 
  &#8220;Don't you want to go home, and carry the news?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I should like to very much.&#8221; 
  Then his countenance changed. Two days hence, as he reflected, the   interest would be payable. Must they lose the house, after all? If   only he had a small part of the money, it would make matters all   right. 
  &#8220;Does anything trouble you?&#8221; asked the manufacturer, noticing the   sudden change in his countenance. 
  Upon this Herbert told him exactly how they were situated in regard  to  the house, and in what danger they were of losing it. 
  &#8220;If it's nothing worse that that,&#8221; said Mr. Cameron, I cheerfully,   &#8220;you needn't feel anxious. I will advance you; a hundred dollars on   account of the contract, and you shall give me a receipt for it.&#8221; 
  Herbert's face cleared instantly, and he was warm in his gratitude. 
  The next morning he started for home. 
  After all, the little model which his father left behind, had  proved  to be his most valuable legacy.
