<b>A MIDDLE-AGED LYRICAL POET IS SUPPOSED TO BE TAKING<br>  FINAL LEAVE OF THE MUSE OF COMEDY. SHE HAS<br>  BROUGHT HIM HIS HAT AND GLOVES, AND IS<br>  ABSTRACTEDLY PICKING A THREAD OF GOLD HAIR<br>  FROM HIS COAT SLEEVE AS HE BEGINS TO SPEAK:</b> 
I say it under the rose--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; oh, thanks!--yes, under the laurel,<br> We part lovers, not foes;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; we are not going to quarrel. 
We have too long been friends<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; on foot and in gilded coaches,<br> Now that the whole thing ends,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; to spoil our kiss with reproaches. 
I leave you; my soul is wrung;<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I pause, look back from the portal--<br> Ah, I no more am young,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and you, child, you are immortal! 
Mine is the glacier's way,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; yours is the blossom's weather--<br> When were December and May<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; known to be happy together? 
Before my kisses grow tame,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; before my moodiness grieve you,<br> While yet my heart is flame,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and I all lover, I leave you. 
So, in the coming time,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when you count the rich years over,<br> Think of me in my prime,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and not as a white-haired lover, 
Fretful, pierced with regret,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the wraith of a dead Desire<br> Thrumming a cracked spinet<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; by a slowly dying fire. 
When, at last, I am cold--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; years hence, if the gods so will it--<br> Say, "He was true as gold,"<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and wear a rose in your fillet! 
Others, tender as I,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; will come and sue for caresses,<br> Woo you, win you, and die--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mind you, a rose in your tresses! 
Some Melpomene woo,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; some hold Clio the nearest;<br> You, sweet Comedy--you<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; were ever sweetest and dearest! 
Nay, it is time to go--<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; when writing your tragic sister<br> Say to that child of woe<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; how sorry I was I missed her. 
Really, I cannot stay,<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; though "parting is such sweet sorrow" . . .<br> Perhaps I will, on my way<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; down-town, look in to-morrow!
