"Room for one here, sir," said the guard, as the train stopped at  Carlsruhe next day, on its way from Heidelberg to Baden.    
The major put down his guide-book, Amy opened her eyes, and Helen  removed her shawl from the opposite seat, as a young man, wrapped in  a cloak, with a green shade over his eyes, and a general air of  feebleness, got in and sank back with a sigh of weariness or pain.  Evidently an invalid, for his face was thin and pale, his dark hair  cropped short, and the ungloved hand attenuated and delicate as a  woman's. A sidelong glance from under the deep shade seemed to satisfy  him regarding his neighbors, and drawing his cloak about him with a  slight shiver, he leaned into the corner and seemed to forget that he  was not alone.    
Helen and Amy exchanged glances of compassionate interest, for women  always pity invalids, especially if young, comely and of the opposite  sex. The major took one look, shrugged his shoulders, and returned  to his book. Presently a hollow cough gave Helen a pretext for  discovering the nationality of the newcomer.    
"Do the open windows inconvenience you, sir?" she asked, in English.    
No answer; the question evidently unintelligible.    
She repeated it in French, lightly touching his cloak to arrest his  attention.    
Instantly a smile broke over the handsome mouth, and in the purest  French he assured her that the fresh air was most agreeable, and  begged pardon for annoying them with his troublesome cough.    
"Not an invalid, I hope, sir?" said the major, in his bluff yet kindly  voice.    
"They tell me I can have no other fate; that my malady is fatal; but I  still hope and fight for my life; it is all I have to give my country  now."    
A stifled sigh and a sad emphasis on the last word roused the sympathy  of the girls, the interest of the major.    
He took another survey, and said, with a tone of satisfaction, as  he marked the martial carriage of the young man, and caught a fiery  glance of the half-hidden eyes,--    
"You are a soldier, sir?"    
"I was; I am nothing now but an exile, for Poland is in chains."    
The words "Poland" and "exile" brought up all the pathetic stories of  that unhappy country which the three listeners had ever heard, and won  their interest at once.    
"You were in the late revolution, perhaps?" asked the major, giving  the unhappy outbreak the most respectful name he could use.    
"From beginning to end."    
"Oh, tell us about it; we felt much sympathy for you, and longed to  have you win," cried Amy, with such genuine interest and pity in her  tone, it was impossible to resist.    
Pressing both hands upon his breast, the young man bent low, with a  flush of feeling on his pale cheek, and answered eagerly,--    
"Ah, you are kind; it is balm to my sore heart to hear words like  these. I thank you, and tell you what you will. It is but little that  I do, yet I give my life, and die a long death, instead of a quick,  brave one with my comrades."    
"You are young to have borne a part in a revolution, sir," said the  major, who pricked up his ears like an old war-horse at the sound of  battle.    
"My friends and myself left the University at Varsovie, as volunteers;  we did our part, and now all lie in their graves but three."    
"You were wounded, it seems?"    
"Many times. Exposure, privation, and sorrow will finish what the  Russian bullets began. But it is well. I have no wish to see my  country enslaved, and I can no longer help her."    
"Let us hope that a happier future waits for you both. Poland loves  liberty too well, and has suffered too much for it, to be kept long in  captivity."    
Helen spoke warmly, and the young man listened with a brightening  face.    
"It is a kind prophecy; I accept it, and take courage. God knows I  need it," he added, low to himself.    
"Are you bound for Italy?" said the major, in a most un-English fit of  curiosity.    
"For Geneva first, Italy later, unless Montreaux is mild enough for me  to winter in. I go to satisfy my friends, but doubt if it avails."    
"Where is Montreaux?" asked Amy.    
"Near Clarens, where Rousseau wrote his Heloise, and Vevay, where  so many English go to enjoy Chillon. The climate is divine for  unfortunates like myself, and life more cheap there than in Italy."    
Here the train stopped again, and Hoffman came to ask if the ladies  desired anything.    
At the sound of his voice the young Pole started, looked up, and  exclaimed, with the vivacity of a foreigner, in German,--    
"By my life, it is Karl! Behold me, old friend, and satisfy me that it  is thyself by a handshake."    
"Casimer! What wind blows thee hither, my boy, in such sad plight?"  replied Hoffman, grasping the slender hand outstretched to him.    
"I fly from an enemy for the first time in my life, and, like all  cowards, shall be conquered in the end. I wrote thee I was better, but  the wound in the breast reopened, and nothing but a miracle will save  me. I go to Switzerland; and thou?"    
"Where my master commands. I serve this gentleman, now."    
"Hard changes for both, but with health thou art king of  circumstances, while I?--Ah well, the good God knows best. Karl, go  thou and buy me two of those pretty baskets of grapes; I will please  myself by giving them to these pitying angels. Speak they German?"    
"One, the elder; but they understand not this rattle of ours."    
Karl disappeared, and Helen, who <i>had</i> understood the rapid dialogue,  tried to seem as unconscious as Amy.    
"Say a friendly word to me at times; I am so homesick and  faint-hearted, my Hoffman. Thanks; they are almost worthy the lips  that shall taste them."    
Taking the two little osier baskets, laden with yellow and purple  clusters, Casimer offered them, with a charming mixture of timidity  and grace, to the girls, saying, like a grateful boy,--    
"You give me kind words and good hopes; permit that I thank you in  this poor way."    
"I drink success to Poland." cried Helen, lifting a great, juicy grape  to her lips, like a little purple goblet, hoping to hide her confusion  under a playful air.    
The grapes went round, and healths were drunk with much merriment,  for in travelling on the Continent it is impossible for the gruffest,  primmest person to long resist the frank courtesy and vivacious chat  of foreigners.    
The major was unusually social and inquisitive, and while the soldiers  fought their battles over again the girls listened and took notes,  with feminine wits on the alert to catch any personal revelations  which might fall from the interesting stranger. The wrongs and  sufferings of Poland were discussed so eloquently that both young  ladies were moved to declare the most undying hatred of Russia,  Prussia, and Austria, the most intense sympathy for "poor Pologne."  All day they travelled together, and as Baden-Baden approached, they  naturally fell to talking of the gay place.    
"Uncle, I must try my fortune once. I've set my heart upon it, and  so has Nell. We want to know how gamblers feel, and to taste the  fascination of the game which draws people here from all parts of  Europe," said Amy, in her half-pleading, half-imperious way.    
"You may risk one napoleon each, as I foolishly promised you should,  when I little thought you would ever have an opportunity to remind me  of my promise. It's not an amusement for respectable Englishwomen, or  men either. You will agree with me there, monsieur?" and the major  glanced at the Pole, who replied, with his peculiar smile:--    
"Surely, yes. It is great folly and waste of time and money; yet I  have known one man who found some good in it, or, rather, brought good  out of it. I have a friend who has a mania for giving. His own fortune  was spent in helping needy students at the University, and poor  professors. This displeased his father, and he refused supplies,  except enough for his simple personal wants. Sigismund chafed at this,  and being skilful at all games, as a gentleman may be in the way of  amusement, he resolved to play with those whose money was wasted on  frivolities, and give his winnings to his band of paupers."    
"How did it succeed, this odd fancy?" asked Helen, with an interested  face, while Amy pinched her arm at the word "Sigismund."    
"Excellently. My friend won often, and as his purpose became known it  caused no unkind feeling, this unusual success, for fortune seemed to  favor his kind object."    
"Wrong, nevertheless, to do evil that good may come of it," said the  major, morally.    
"It may be so: but it is not for me to censure my benefactor. He has  done much for my countrymen and myself, and is so truly noble I can  see no fault in him."    
"What an odd name! Sigismund is German, is it not?" asked Amy, in the  most artless tone of interest.    
"Yes, mademoiselle, and Palsdorf is a true German; much courage,  strength and intellect, with the gayety and simplicity of a boy. He  hates slavery of all kinds, and will be free at all costs. He is a  good son, but his father is tyrannical, and asks too much. Sigismund  will not submit to sell himself, and so is in disgrace for a time."    
"Palsdorf!--was not that the name of the count or baron we heard them  talking of at Coblentz?" said Helen to Amy, with a well-feigned air of  uncertainty.    
"Yes; I heard something of a duel and a broken betrothal, I think. The  people seemed to consider the baron a wild young man, so it could not  have been your friend, sir," was Amy's demure reply, glancing at Helen  with mirthful eyes, as if to say, "How our baron haunts us!"    
"It is the same, doubtless. Many consider him wild, because he is  original, and dares act for himself. As it is well known, I may tell  you the truth of the duel and the betrothal, if you care to hear a  little romance."    
Casimer looked eager to defend his friend, and as the girls were  longing to hear the romance, permission was given.    
"In Germany, you know, the young people are often betrothed in  childhood by the parents, and sometimes never meet till they are  grown. Usually all goes well; but not always, for love cannot come at  command. Sigismund was plighted, when a boy of fifteen, to his  young cousin, and then sent away to the University till of age. On  returning, he was to travel a year or two, and then marry. He gladly  went away, and with increasing disquiet saw the time draw near when he  must keep his troth-plight."    
"Hum! loved some one else. Very unfortunate to be sure," said the  major with a sigh.    
"Not so; he only loved his liberty, and pretty Minna was less dear  than a life of perfect freedom. He went back at the appointed  time, saw his cousin, tried to do his duty and love her; found it  impossible, and, discovering that Minna loved another, vowed he would  never make her unhappiness as well as his own. The old baron stormed,  but the young one was firm, and would not listen to a marriage without  love; but pleaded for Minna, wished his rival success, and set out  again on his travels."    
"And the duel?" asked the major, who took less interest in love than  war.    
"That was as characteristic as the other act. A son of one high in  office at Berlin circulated false reports of the cause of Palsdorf's  refusal of the alliance--reports injurious to Minna. Sigismund settled  the matter in the most effectual manner, by challenging and wounding  the man. But for court influence it would have gone hardly with my  friend. The storm, however, has blown over; Minna will be happy with  her lover, and Sigismund with his liberty, till he tires of it."    
"Is he handsome, this hero of yours?" said Amy, feeling the ring under  her glove, for in spite of Helen's advice, she insisted on wearing it,  that it might be at hand to return at any moment, should chance again  bring the baron in their way.    
"A true German of the old type; blond and blue-eyed, tall and strong.  My hero in good truth--brave and loyal, tender and true," was the  enthusiastic answer.    
"I hate fair men," pouted Amy, under her breath, as the major asked  some question about hotels.    
"Take a new hero, then; nothing can be more romantic than that,"  whispered Helen, glancing at the pale, dark-haired figure wrapped in  the military cloak opposite.    
"I will, and leave the baron to you;" said Amy, with a stifled laugh.    
"Hush! Here are Baden and Karl," replied Helen, thankful for the  interruption.    
All was bustle in a moment, and taking leave of them with an air  of reluctance, the Pole walked away, leaving Amy looking after him  wistfully, quite unconscious that she stood in everybody's way, and  that her uncle was beckoning impatiently from the carriage door.    
"Poor boy! I wish he had some one to take care of him." she sighed,  half aloud.    
"Mademoiselle, the major waits;" and Karl came up, hat in hand, just  in time to hear her and glance after Casimer, with an odd expression.
