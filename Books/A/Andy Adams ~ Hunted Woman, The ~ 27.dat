  As they went up out of the basin into the broad meadows of the  larger valley, MacDonald rode between Aldous and Joanne, and the  pack-horses, led by Pinto, trailed behind.
  Again old Donald said, as he searched the valley:
  &#8220;We've beat 'em, Johnny. Quade an' Rann are coming up on the other  side of the range, and I figger they're just about a day behind&#8212;mebby  only hours, or an hour. You can't tell. There's more gold back there.  We got about a hunderd pounds in them fifteen sacks, an' there was  twice that much. It's hid somewhere. Calkins used to keep his'n under  the floor. So did Watts. We'll find it later. An' the river, an' the  dry gulches on both sides of the valley&#8212;they're full of it! It's all  gold, Johnny&#8212;gold everywhere!&#8221;
  He pointed ahead to where the valley rose in a green slope between  two mountains half a mile away.
  &#8220;That's the break,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It don't seem very far now, do it,  Joanne?&#8221; His silence seemed to have dropped from him like a mantle, and  there was joy in what he was telling. &#8220;But it was a distance that  night&#8212;a tumble distance,&#8221; he continued, before she could answer. &#8220;That  was forty-one years ago, coming November. An' it was cold, an' the snow  was deep. It was bitter cold&#8212;so cold it caught my Jane's lungs, an'  that was what made her go a little later. The slope up there don't look  steep now, but it was steep then&#8212;with two feet of snow to drag  ourselves through. I don't think the cavern is more'n five or six miles  away, Johnny, mebby less, an' it took us twenty hours to reach it. It  snowed so heavy that night, an' the wind blowed so, that our trail was  filled up or they might ha' followed.&#8221;
  Many times Aldous had been on the point of asking old Donald a  question. For the first time he asked it now, even as his eyes swept  slowly and searchingly over the valley for signs of Mortimer FitzHugh  and Quade.
  &#8220;I've often wondered why you ran away with Jane,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I know  what threatened her&#8212;a thing worse than death. But why did you run? Why  didn't you stay and fight?&#8221;
  A low growl rumbled in MacDonald's beard.
  &#8220;Johnny, Johnny, if I only ha' could!&#8221; he groaned. &#8220;There was five  of them left when I ran into the cabin an' barricaded myself there with  Jane. I stuck my gun out of the window an' they was afraid to rush the  cabin. They was<I> afraid</I>, Johnny, all that afternoon&#8212;<I>an' I  didn't have a cartridge left to fire!</I> That's why we went just as  soon as we could crawl out in the dark. I knew they'd come that night.  I might ha' killed one or two hand to hand, for I was big an' strong in  them days, Johnny, but I knew I couldn't beat 'em all. So we went.&#8221;
  &#8220;After all, death isn't so very terrible,&#8221; said Joanne softly, and  she was riding so close that for a moment she laid one of her warm  hands on Donald MacDonald's.
  &#8220;No, it's sometimes&#8212;wunnerful&#8212;an' beautiful,&#8221; replied Donald, a  little brokenly, and with that he rode ahead, and Joanne and Aldous  waited until the pack-horses had passed them.
  &#8220;He's going to see that all is clear at the summit,&#8221; explained  Aldous.
  They seemed to be riding now right into the face of that mysterious  rumble and roar of the mountains. It was an hour before they all stood  together at the top of the break, and here MacDonald swung sharply to  the right, and came soon to the rock-strewn bed of a dried-up stream  that in ages past had been a wide and rushing torrent. Steadily, as  they progressed down this, the rumble and roar grew nearer. It seemed  that it was almost under their feet, when again MacDonald turned, and a  quarter of an hour later they found themselves at the edge of a small  plain; and now all about them were cold and towering mountains that  shut out the sun, and a hundred yards to their right was a great dark  cleft in the floor of the plain, and up out of this came the rumble and  roar that was like the sullen anger of monster beasts imprisoned deep  down in the bowels of the earth.
  MacDonald got off his horse, and Aldous and Joanne rode up to him.  In the old man's face was a look of joy and triumph.
  &#8220;It weren't so far as I thought it was, Johnny!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Oh, it  must ha' been a turrible night&#8212;a turrible night when Jane an' I come  this way! It took us twenty hours, Johnny!&#8221;
  &#8220;We are near the cavern?&#8221; breathed Joanne.
  &#8220;It ain't more'n half a mile farther on, I guess. But we'll camp  here. We're pretty well hid. They can't find us. An' from that summit  up there we can keep watch in both valleys.&#8221;
  Knowing the thoughts that were in MacDonald's mind, and how full his  heart was with a great desire, Aldous went to him when they had  dismounted.
  &#8220;You go on alone if there is time to-night, Mac,&#8221; he said, knowing  that the other would understand him. &#8220;I will make camp.&#8221;
  &#8220;There ain't no one in the valley,&#8221; mused the old man, a little  doubtfully at first. &#8220;It would be safe&#8212;quite safe, Johnny.&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, it will be safe.&#8221;
  &#8220;And I will stand guard while John is working,&#8221; said Joanne, who had  come to them. &#8220;No one can approach us without being seen.&#8221;
  For another moment MacDonald hesitated. Then he said:
  &#8220;Do you see that break over there across the plain? It's the open to  a gorge. Johnny, it do seem unreasonable&#8212;it do seem as though I must  ha' been dreamin'&#8212;when I think that it took us twenty hours! But the  snow was to my waist in this plain, an' it was slow work&#8212;turrible slow  work! I think the cavern&#8212;ain't on'y a little way up that gorge.&#8221;
  &#8220;You can make it before the sun is quite gone.&#8221;
  &#8220;An' I could hear you shout, or your gun. I could ride back in five  minutes&#8212;an' I wouldn't be gone an hour.&#8221;
  &#8220;There is no danger,&#8221; urged Aldous.
  A deep breath came from old Donald's breast.
  &#8220;I guess&#8212;I'll go, Johnny, if you an' Joanne don't mind.&#8221;
  He looked about him, and then he pointed toward the face of a great  rock.
  &#8220;Put the tepee up near that,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Pile the saddles, an' the  blankets, an' the panniers around it, so it'll look like a real camp,  Johnny. But it won't be a real camp. It'll be a dummy. See them thick  spruce an' cedar over there? Build Joanne a shelter of boughs in there,  an' take in some grub, an' blankets, an' the gold. See the point,  Johnny? If anything should happen&#8212;&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;They'd tackle the bogus camp!&#8221; cried Aldous with elation. &#8220;It's a  splendid idea!&#8221;
  He set at once about unpacking the horses, and Joanne followed close  at his side to help him. MacDonald mounted his horse and rode at a trot  in the direction of the break in the mountain.
  The sun had disappeared, but its reflection was still on the peaks;  and after he had stripped and hobbled the horses Aldous took advantage  of the last of day to scrutinize the plain and the mountain slopes  through the telescope. After that he found enough dry poles with which  to set up the tepee, and about this he scattered the saddles and  panniers, as MacDonald had suggested. Then he cleared a space in the  thick spruce, and brought to it what was required for their hidden  camp.
  It was almost dark when he completed the spruce and cedar lean-to  for Joanne. He knew that to-night they must build no fire, not even for  tea; and when they had laid out the materials for their cold supper,  which consisted of beans, canned beef and tongue, peach marmalade,  bread bannock, and pickles and cheese, he went with Joanne for water to  a small creek they had crossed a hundred yards away. In both his hands,  ready for instant action, he carried his rifle. Joanne carried the  pail. Her eyes were big and bright and searching in that thick-growing  dusk of night. She walked very close to Aldous, and she said:
  &#8220;John, I know how careful you and Donald have been in this journey  into the North. I know what you have feared. Culver Rann and Quade are  after the gold, and they are near. But why does Donald talk as though  we are<I> surely</I> going to be attacked by them, or are<I> surely</I>  going to attack them? I don't understand it, John. If you don't care  for the gold so much, as you told me once, and if we find Jane  to-morrow, or to-night, why do we remain to have trouble with Quade and  Culver Rann? Tell me, John.&#8221;
  He could not see her face fully in the gloom, and he was glad that  she could not see his.
  &#8220;If we can get away without fighting, we will, Joanne,&#8221; he lied. And  he knew that she would have known that he was lying if it had not been  for the darkness.
  &#8220;You won't fight&#8212;over the gold?&#8221; she asked, pressing his arm. &#8220;Will  you promise me that, John?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, I promise that. I swear it!&#8221; he cried, and so forcefully that  she gave a glad little laugh.
  &#8220;Then if they don't find us to-morrow, we'll go back home?&#8221; She  trembled, and he knew that her heart was filled with a sudden  lightness. &#8220;And I don't believe they will find us. They won't come  beyond that terrible place&#8212;and the gold! Why should they, John? Why  should they follow us&#8212;if we leave them everything? Oh-h-h-h!&#8221; She  shuddered, and whispered: &#8220;I wish we had not brought the gold, John. I  wish we had left it behind!&#8221;
  &#8220;What we have is worth thirty or forty thousand dollars,&#8221; he said  reassuringly, as he filled his pail with water and they began to  return. &#8220;We can do a great deal of good with that. Endowments, for  instance,&#8221; he laughed.
  As he spoke, they both stopped, and listened. Plainly they heard the  approaching thud of hoofs. MacDonald had been gone nearer two hours  than one, and believing that it was him, Aldous gave the owl signal.  The signal floated back to them softly. Five minutes later MacDonald  rode up and dismounted. Until he had taken the saddle off, and had  hobbled his horse, he did not speak. Neither Joanne nor Aldous asked  the question that was in their hearts. But even in the darkness they  felt something. It was as if not only the torrent rushing through the  chasm, but MacDonald's heart as well, was charging the air with a  strange and subdued excitement. And when MacDonald spoke, that which  they had felt was in his voice.
  &#8220;You ain't seen or heard anything, Johnny?&#8221;
  &#8220;Nothing. And you&#8212;Donald?&#8221;
  In the darkness, Joanne went to the old man, and her hand found one  of his, and clasped it tightly; and she found that Donald MacDonald's  big hand was trembling in a strange and curious way, and she could feel  him quivering.
  &#8220;You found Jane?&#8221; she whispered.
  &#8220;Yes, I found her, little Joanne.&#8221;
  She did not let go of his hand until they entered the open space  which Aldous had made in the spruce. Then she remembered what Aldous  had said to her earlier in the day, and cheerfully she lighted the two  candles they had set out, and forced Aldous down first upon the ground,  and then MacDonald, and began to help them to beans and meat and  bannock, while all the time her heart was crying out to know about the  cavern&#8212;and Jane. The candleglow told her a great deal, for in it  Donald MacDonald's face was very calm, and filled with a great peace,  despite the trembling she had felt. Her woman's sympathy told her that  his heart was too full on this night for speech, and when he ate but  little she did not urge him to eat more; and when he rose and went  silently and alone out into the darkness she held Aldous back; and  when, still a little later, she went into her nest for the night, she  whispered softly to him:
  &#8220;I know that he found Jane as he wanted to find her, and he is  happy. I think he has gone out there alone&#8212;to cry.&#8221; And for a time  after that, as he sat in the gloom, John Aldous knew that Joanne was  sobbing like a little child in the spruce and cedar shelter he had  built for her.
