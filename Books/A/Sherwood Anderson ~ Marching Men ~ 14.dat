The funeral of Nance McGregor was an event in Coal Creek. In the minds  of the miners she stood for something. Fearing and hating the husband  and the tall big-fisted son they had yet a tenderness for the mother  and wife. "She lost her money handing us out bread," they said as they  pounded on the bar in the saloon. Word ran about among them and they  returned again and again to the subject. The fact that she had lost  her man twice--once in the mine when the timber fell and clouded his  brain, and then later when his body lay black and distorted near the  door to the McCrary cut after the dreadful time of the fire in the  mine--was perhaps forgotten but the fact that she had once kept a  store and that she had lost her money serving them was not forgotten.    
On the day of the funeral the miners came up out of the mine and stood  in groups in the open street and in the vacant bake shop. The men of  the night shift had their faces washed and had put white paper collars  about their necks. The man who owned the saloon locked the front door  and putting the keys into his pocket stood on the side-walk looking  silently at the windows of Nance McGregor's rooms. Out along the  runway from the mines came other miners--men of the day shift. Setting  their dinner pails on the stone along the front of the saloon and  crossing the railroad they kneeled and washed their blackened faces in  the red stream that flowed at the foot of the embankment The voice of  the preacher, a slender wasp-like young man with black hair and dark  shadows under his eyes, floated out to the listening men. A train of  loaded coke cars rumbled past along the back of the stores.    
McGregor sat at the head of the coffin dressed in a new black suit. He  stared at the wall back of the head of the preacher, not hearing,  thinking his own thoughts.    
Back of McGregor sat the undertaker's pale daughter. She leaned  forward until she touched the back of the chair in front and sat with  her face buried in a white handkerchief. Her weeping cut across the  voice of the preacher in the closely crowded little room filled with  miners' wives and in the midst of his prayer for the dead she was  taken with a violent fit of coughing and had to get up and hurry out  of the room.    
After the services in the rooms above the bake shop a procession  formed on Main Street. Like awkward boys the miners fell into groups  and walked along behind the black hearse and the carriage in which sat  the dead woman's son with the minister. The men kept looking at each  other and smiling sheepishly. There had been no arrangement to follow  the body to its grave and when they thought of the son and the  attitude he had always maintained toward them they wondered whether or  not he wanted them to follow.    
And McGregor was unconscious of all this. He sat in the carriage  beside the minister and with unseeing eyes stared over the heads of  the horses. He was thinking of his life in the city and of what he  should do there in the future, of Edith Carson, sitting in the cheap  dance hall and of the evenings he had spent with her, of the barber on  the park bench talking of women and of his life with his mother when  he was a boy in the mining town.    
As the carriage climbed slowly up the hill followed by the miners  McGregor began to love his mother. For the first time he realised that  her life was full of meaning and that in her woman's way she had been  quite as heroic in her years of patient toil as had been her man  Cracked McGregor when he ran to his death in the burning mine.  McGregor's hands began to tremble and his shoulders straightened. He  became conscious of the men, the dumb blackened children of toil  dragging their weary legs up the hill.    
For what? McGregor stood up in the carriage and turning about looked  at the men. Then he fell upon his knees on the carriage seat and  watched them eagerly, his soul crying out to something he thought must  be hidden away among the black mass of them, something that was the  keynote of their lives, something for which he had not looked and in  which he had not believed.    
McGregor, kneeling in the open carriage at the top of the hill and  watching the marching men slowly toiling upward, had of a sudden one  of those strange awakenings that are the reward of stoutness in stout  souls. A strong wind lifted the smoke from the coke ovens and blew it  up the face of the hill on the farther side of the valley and the wind  seemed to have lifted also some of the haze that had covered his eyes.  At the foot of the hill along the railroad he could see the little  stream, one of the blood red streams of the mine country, and the dull  red houses of the miners. The red of the coke ovens, the red sun  setting behind the hills to the west and last of all the red stream  flowing like a river of blood down through the valley made a scene  that burned itself into the brain of the miner's son. A lump came into  his throat and for a moment he tried vainly to get back his old  satisfying hate of the town and the miners but it would not come. Long  he looked down the hill to where the miners of the night shift marched  up the hill after the carriage and the slowly moving hearse. It seemed  to him that they like himself were marching up out of the smoke and  the little squalid houses away from the shores of the blood red river  into something new. What? McGregor shook his head slowly like an  animal in pain. He wanted something for himself, for all these men. It  seemed to him that he would gladly lie dead like Nance McGregor to  know the secret of that want.    
And then as though in answer to the cry out of his heart the file of  marching men fell into step. An instantaneous impulse seemed to run  through the ranks of stooped toiling figures. Perhaps they also  looking backward had caught the magnificence of the picture scrawled  across the landscape in black and red and had been moved by it so that  their shoulders straightened and the long subdued song of life began  to sing in their bodies. With a swing the marching men fell into step.  Into the mind of McGregor flashed a thought of another day when he had  stood upon this same hill with the half crazed man who stuffed birds  and sat upon a log by the roadside reading the Bible and how he had  hated these men because they did not march with orderly precision like  the soldiers who came to subdue them. In a flash he knew that he who  had hated the miners hated them no more. With Napoleonic insight he  read a lesson into the accident of the men's falling into step behind  his carriage. A big grim thought flashed into his brain. "Some day a  man will come who will swing all of the workers of the world into step  like that," he thought. "He will make them conquer, not one another  but the terrifying disorder of life. If their lives have been wrecked  by disorder it is not their fault. They have been betrayed by the  ambitions of their leaders, all men have betrayed them." McGregor  thought that his mind swept down over the men, that the impulses of  his mind like living things ran among them, crying to them, touching  them, caressing them. Love invaded his spirit and made his body  tingle. He thought of the workers in the Chicago warehouse and of the  millions of others workers who in that great city, in all cities,  everywhere, went at the end of the day shuffling off along the streets  to their houses carrying with them no song, no hope, nothing but a few  paltry dollars with which to buy food and keep the endless hurtful  scheme of things alive. "There is a curse on my country," he cried.  "Everyone has come here for gain, to grow rich, to achieve. Suppose  they should begin to want to live here. Suppose they should quit  thinking of gain, leaders and followers of leaders. They are children.  Suppose like children they should begin to play a bigger game. Suppose  they could just learn to march, nothing else. Suppose they should  begin to do with their bodies what their minds are not strong enough  to do--to just learn the one simple thing, to march, whenever two or  four or a thousand of them get together, to march."    
McGregor's thoughts moved him so that he wanted to yell. Instead his  face grew stern and he tried to command himself. "No, wait," he  whispered. "Train yourself. Here is something to give point to your  life. Be patient and wait." Again his thoughts swept away, running  down to the advancing men. Tears came into his eyes. "Men have taught  them that big lesson only when they wanted to kill. This must be  different. Some one must teach them the big lesson just for their own  sakes, that they also may know. They must march fear and disorder and  purposelessness away. That must come first."    
McGregor turned and compelled himself to sit quietly beside the  minister in the carriage. He became bitter against the leaders of men,  the figures in old history that had once loomed so big in his mind.    
"They have half taught them the secret only to betray them," he  muttered. "The men of books and of brains have done the same. That  loose-jawed fellow in the street last night--there must be thousands  of such, talking until their jaws hang loose like worn-out gates.  Words mean nothing but when a man marches with a thousand other men  and is not doing it for the glory of some king, then it will mean  something. He will know then that he is a part of something real and  he will catch the rhythm of the mass and glory in the fact that he is  a part of the mass and that the mass has meaning. He will begin to  feel great and powerful." McGregor smiled grimly. "That is what the  great leaders of armies have known," he whispered. "And they have sold  men out. They have used that knowledge to subdue men, to make them  serve their own little ends."    
McGregor continued to look back at the men and in an odd sort of way  to wonder at himself and the thought that had come to him. "It can be  done," he presently said aloud. "It will be done by some one,  sometime. Why not by me?"    
They buried Nance McGregor in the deep hole dug by her son before the  log on the hillside. On the morning of his arrival he had secured  permission of the mining company who owned the land to make this the  burial place of the McGregors.    
When the service over the grave was finished he looked about him at  the miners, standing uncovered along the hill and in the road leading  down into the valley, and felt that he should like to tell them what  was in his mind. He had an impulse to jump upon the log beside the  grave and in the presence of the green fields his father loved and  across the grave of Nance McGregor shout to them saying, "Your cause  shall be my cause. My brain and strength shall be yours. Your enemies  I shall smite with my naked fist." Instead he walked rapidly past them  and topping the hill went down toward the town into the gathering  night.    
McGregor could not sleep on that last night he was ever to spend in  Coal Creek. When darkness came he went along the street and stood at  the foot of the stairs leading to the home of the undertaker's  daughter. The emotions that had swept over him during the afternoon  had subdued his spirit and he wanted to be with some one who would  also be subdued and quiet. When the woman did not come down the stairs  to stand in the hallway as she had done in his boyhood he went up and  knocked at her door. Together they went along Main Street and climbed  the hill.    
The undertaker's daughter walked with difficulty and was compelled to  stop and sit upon a stone by the roadside. When she attempted to rise  McGregor gathered her into his arms and when she protested patted her  thin shoulder with his big hand and whispered to her. "Be quiet," he  said. "Do not talk about anything. Just be quiet."    
The nights in the hills above mining towns are magnificent. The long  valleys, cut and slashed by the railroads and made ugly by the squalid  little houses of the miners are half lost in the soft blackness. Out  of the darkness sounds emerge. Coal cars creak and protest as they are  pushed along rails. Voices cry out. With a long reverberating rattle  one of the mine cars dumps its load down a metal chute into a car  standing on the railroad tracks. In the winter little fires are  started along the tracks by the workmen who are employed about the  tipple and on summer nights the moon comes out and touches with wild  beauty the banks of black smoke that drift upward from the long rows  of coke ovens.    
With the sick woman in his arms McGregor sat in silence on the  hillside above Coal Creek and let new thoughts and new impulses play  with his spirit. The love for the figure of his mother that had come  to him during the afternoon returned and he took the woman of the mine  country into his arms and held her closely against his breast.    
The struggling man in the hills of his own country, who was trying to  clear his soul of the hatred of men bred in him by the disorder of  life, lifted his head and pressed the body of the undertaker's  daughter hard against his own body. The woman, understanding his mood,  picked with her thin fingers at his coat and wished she might die  there in the darkness in the arms of the man she loved. When he became  conscious of her presence and relaxed the grip of his arms about her  shoulders she lay still and waited for him to forget again and again  to press her tightly and let her feel in her worn-out body his massive  strength and virility.    
"It is a job. It is something big I can try to do," he whispered to  himself and in fancy saw the great disorderly city on the western  plains rocked by the swing and rhythm of men, aroused and awakening  with their bodies a song of new life.
