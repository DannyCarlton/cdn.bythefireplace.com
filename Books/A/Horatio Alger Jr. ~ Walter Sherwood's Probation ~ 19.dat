  Two weeks passed. Walter applied for all sorts of situations, but   obtained no engagement. Meanwhile his money steadily diminished, till   he awoke one morning to find only seventy-five cents in his purse.   Things were getting decidedly serious. 
  &quot;I wonder if there is any poorhouse in Chicago,&quot; thought Walter,  not  wholly in jest. &quot;It is not the sort of home I should prefer, but  it is  better than genteel starvation.&quot; 
  He went out, breakfasted, and at the restaurant picked up a copy of   the Chicago _Times_. This was a piece of luck, for it saved him from   the small expenditure necessary to secure it. He turned to the   department of Help Wanted, and looking down the column came to this   notice: 
  &quot;WANTED&#8212;By a traveling lecturer, a young man who can make himself   generally useful; one who plays the violin preferred. Apply to   PROFESSOR ROBINSON, Hotel Brevoort.&quot; 
  Walter knew this hotel. It was located on Madison Street, and was  on  the European plan. 
  &quot;That will suit me,&quot; he said to himself. &quot;I must lose no time in   making application. I can play the violin fairly well. If it will help   me to a position, I will bless the violin.&quot; 
  In ten minutes he was at the hotel, inquiring for Professor  Robinson. 
  &quot;He is in his room,&quot; said the clerk, &quot;You can go up at once.&quot; 
  Guided by a bell-boy, Walter reached the door of No. 65 and  knocked. 
  &quot;Come in!&quot; said a deep bass voice. 
  Opening the door he found himself in the presence of a stout man,   inclined to be tall, with a long, full beard, who glanced at him   inquiringly. 
  &quot;Professor Robinson, I believe?&quot; said Walter. 
  &quot;I am the man,&quot; answered the professor. 
  &quot;I have come to apply for a position. I have read your  advertisement  in the _Times_.&quot; 
  &quot;Just so! Let me look at you.&quot; 
  Walter blushed a little while the professor transfixed him with his   glittering eye. He anxiously hoped that he would bear inspection. 
  &quot;Humph! I think you'll do. How old are you?&quot; 
  &quot;Eighteen.&quot; 
  In fact, Walter's birthday had been passed in Chicago. 
  &quot;You are rather young. Can you play on the violin?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Let me hear you.&quot; 
  The professor pointed to a violin on the bed. 
  &quot;I am glad he doesn't expect me to furnish the violin,&quot; Walter said  to  himself. 
  He took the instrument from its case, and trying the strings began  to  play a series of familiar airs. The violin was not a Stradivarius,  but  it was of good quality, and responded satisfactorily to the  efforts of  the young musician. Professor Robinson listened  attentively, and  nodded his approval. 
  &quot;You play better than the last young man I had.&quot; 
  Walter was glad to hear it. 
  &quot;I may as well tell you the nature of your duties, in case I engage   you. I call myself a traveling lecturer, but this may convey an   erroneous idea. I am the discoverer of Professor Robinson's Liquid   Balm, which is warranted to cure more diseases than any other patent   preparation in existence. I won't go into particulars, for these can   be read in my circular. Now, it is my custom to go from one town to   another, engage a hall if the weather requires, otherwise gather a   crowd around me in a public place, and lecture about the merits of my   remarkable preparation. You, besides assisting me in a general way,   are expected to draw and entertain the crowd by your performance on   the violin. Can you sing?&quot; 
  Walter shook his head. 
  &quot;I am afraid,&quot; he said, &quot;that if I should undertake to sing it  would  drive away the crowd.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well! It isn't necessary, though it would have helped. Now,  what  are your ideas as to compensation?&quot; 
  As the professor spoke, he leaned back in his chair and awaited a   reply. 
  &quot;I hardly know what it would be right to ask,&quot; returned Walter   hesitatingly. &quot;How much did you pay your last assistant?&quot; 
  &quot;I paid him fifteen dollars a month and his traveling expenses.&quot; 
  This was a good deal more than Walter had made since he had  undertaken  to earn his own living, yet there seemed small chance of  laying up  anything out of it. 
  &quot;May I ask, sir,&quot; he inquired, &quot;do you meet with pretty good  success  in disposing of your balm?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes; the public knows a good thing when it is brought to its   attention.&quot; 
  &quot;Would you be willing to pay my expenses and ten per cent.  commission  on sales?&quot; 
  &quot;Why do you prefer this to a stated salary?&quot; 
  &quot;Because it would be an incentive to do my best. Then if I helped  you  to a successful sale I should be paid in proportion.&quot; 
  &quot;I have an idea. You look blooming and healthy. Are you willing I   should advertise you as one who has been snatched from death by my   celebrated balm?&quot; 
  &quot;I don't think I would like it, sir. It would be imposing upon the   public.&quot; 
  &quot;I merely suggested it, but I won't insist upon it. I suppose you  are  thoroughly honest and reliable?&quot; 
  Walter smiled. 
  &quot;I don't know that my assurance will satisfy you, but I can truly  say  that I am.&quot; 
  &quot;You look it, and I trust a good deal to appearances. I will accept   your assurance.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Can you join me at once?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  &quot;Then I will expect you to bring your baggage here during the  day&#8212;the  sooner the better. You will then receive your instructions.&quot; 
  Walter was very glad to hear this, for his purse was so nearly   exhausted that it was comforting to think his lodging and meals would   hereafter be paid by some one else. When he came to reflect upon the   nature of his duties&#8212;general assistant to a quack doctor, playing on   village commons and in country halls to draw a crowd of prospective   customers, he felt that it was hardly a thing to be proud of. With his   college training he ought to be qualified for something better, but   the cold, hard fact stared him in the face that it was the only   employment that offered, and he must accept it or starve. Walter had   become practical. His limited acquaintance with the world had made him   so, and he was not going to refuse bread and butter because it was   offered by a quack doctor. 
  Within an hour Walter had given up his room&#8212;the rent had been paid  in  advance&#8212;and transferred his luggage to the Hotel Brevoort, where  he  was assigned a small apartment on the upper floor. 
  &quot;I shall leave the city in two days,&quot; said the professor. &quot;I have  put  an advertisement into the daily papers which brings customers to  the  hotel, but I depend chiefly upon my sales on the road.&quot; 
  &quot;Do you travel on the cars?&quot; asked Walter. 
  &quot;No; I have a neat wagon in which I carry a supply of bottles of  balm,  and this enables me to stop where I like. I prefer villages to  very  large towns and cities. It is better for me to visit places where   there are no drug-stores, as the people are more dependent on what is   brought to them.&quot; 
  &quot;When you are in the city shall I get my commission?&quot; 
  &quot;Ahem! I am not clear as to that,&quot; answered Professor Robinson   thoughtfully. &quot;You see you are not called upon to play.&quot; 
  &quot;Suppose you give me five per cent. in Chicago and large places.&quot; 
  &quot;Very well. I will do so. I will settle with you at the end of  every  week, if that will be satisfactory.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, sir.&quot; 
  Two days afterward a light wagon drew up in front of the hotel,  drawn  by a strong horse, and Walter helped the professor to put a  trunk of  medicine in the back part. Then he seated himself with  Professor  Robinson on the front seat, and they set out in the  direction of the  suburbs. 
  A new life was opening before Walter. What it would lead to he  could  not guess. At any rate, it promised him a living, and this was a   practical advantage which he had learned to appreciate. 
  &quot;How long have you been in this business, professor?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Ten years,&quot; answered the professor. 
  &quot;How did you happen to go into it?&quot; 
  &quot;I'll tell you. Ten years ago I found myself in a tight place. I  was  on my uppers, as the actors say. A friend, who was a drug clerk,  gave  me the recipe for my balm, I borrowed a hundred dollars, had a   quantity made up, and set out on the road.&quot; 
  &quot;And now?&quot; 
  &quot;Now I am worth fifteen thousand dollars, well invested, and can  make  a good living every year.&quot; 
  All this was encouraging to Walter. He was eager to begin his work.
