Kirkpatrick sat before a crescent composed of Mrs. Mortimer Dwight, Mrs.  Francis Leslie Bascom and Miss Aileen Livingston Lawton.    
His reasons for coming to Ballinger House--which even he knew was  inaccessible to the common herd--were separate and tabulated. Alexina had  fascinated him against his best class principles; but he not only jumped at  the chance of meeting her again, he was excessively curious to understand a  woman of her class, to watch her in different moods and situations. He was  equally curious to meet other women of the same breed; he had never brushed  their skirts before, but he had often stood and gazed at them hungrily as  they passed in their limousines or driving their smart little electric  cars.    
He was also curious to see several of those "interiors" he had read so much  about, and hoped his pupils would meet in turn at their different homes. He  was a sincere and honest socialist, was Mr. Kirkpatrick, and he had a good  healthy class-consciousness and class-hatred. But he also had a large  measure of intelligent curiosity. He had never expected to have the  opportunity to gratify it in respect to "bourgeois" inner circles, and when  it came he had only hesitated long enough to search his soul and assure  himself that he was in no danger of growing compliant and soft. Moreover he  might possibly make converts, and in any case it was not a bad way, society  being still what it was, of turning an honest penny.    
But in this the first lesson he was as disconcerted as a socialist serene  in his faith could be.    
The three girls had curved their slender bodies forward, resting one elbow  on a knee. At the end of each of these feline arches was a pair of fixed  and glowing eyes. No doubt there were faces also, but he was only vaguely  aware of three white disks from which flowed forth lambent streams of  concentrated light. They looked like three little sea-monsters, slim,  flexible, malignant, ready to spring.    
He exaggerated in his embarrassment, but he was not so very far wrong.    
"The little devils!" he thought in his righteous wrath. "I'll teach 'em,  all right."    
As it was necessary to break the farcical silence he said in a voice too  loud for the small library. "Well, what is it about socialism that you  don't just know? Mrs. Dwight told me you had read some."    
"There is one thing I want to say before we begin," said Aileen in her high  light impertinent voice, "and that is that if there is one thing that makes  us more angry than another it is to be called <i>bourgeois</i>."    
"And ain't you?"    
"We are not. I suppose your Marx didn't know the difference, although he  is said to have married well, but <i>bourgeois</i> for centuries in Europe  had meant middle-class. Just that and nothing more. Marx had no right to  pervert an honest historic old word into something so different and so  obnoxious."    
"To Marx all capitalists were in the same class. I suppose what you mean is  that you society folks call yourselves aristocrats, even when you have less  capital than some of them that can't get in."    
"Sure thing. Take it from me."    
He gazed at her astounded, and once more had recourse to his rather heavy  sarcasm.    
"Even when they use slang."    
"Oh, we're never afraid to--like lots of the middle-class--bourgeois. Too  sure of ourselves to care a hang what any one thinks of us."    
Alexina came hastily to the rescue, for a dull glow was kindling in Mr.  Kirkpatrick's small sharp eyes. She didn't mind baiting him a little, but  as he was in a way her guest he must be protected from the naughtiness of  Aileen and the insolence of Sibyl Bascom, who had taken a cigarette from a  gold bejeweled case that dangled from her wrist and was asking him for a  light. He gave her measure for measure, for he lifted his heavy boot and  struck a match on the sole.    
"You must not be too hard on us, Mr. Kirkpatrick." Alexina upreared and  leaned against the high back of her chair with a sweet and gracious  dignity, "We are really a pack of ignoramuses, full of prejudices, which,  however, we would get rid of if we knew how. We are hoping everything from  these lessons."    
"Do <i>you</i> smoke?"    
"No, I don't happen to like the taste of tobacco, but I quite approve of my  friends smoking--unless they smoke their nerves out by the roots, as Miss  Lawton does. Don't give her a light. But I'm sure you smoke. I'll get you a  cigar."    
She pinched Aileen, glared at Sibyl, and left the room.

Mortimer was smoking furiously, trying to concentrate his mind on the  evening paper.    
"Give me a cigar, Morty dear."    
"A cigar? What for?"    
"It would be too mean of those girls to smoke unless Mr. Kirkpatrick did  too, and I am sure we couldn't stand his tobacco. Even a whiff of bad  tobacco makes me feel quite ill."    
"I'll be hanged if I give my cigars to that bounder. The kitchen is the  place for him."    
"But not for us. And our minds are quite made up, you know. We are going  to study with him just to find out what these strange animals called  socialists are like. He is queer enough, to begin, with. And the knowledge  may prove useful one of these days....If you won't give me one I'll send  James out--"    
Mortimer handed over one of his choice cigars with ill grace, and Alexina  returned to the library. Aileen was informing Mr. Kirkpatrick how intensely  she disliked Marx's beard, not only as she had seen it in a photograph, but  as she had smelt it in Spargo's too vivid description.    
He rose awkwardly as she entered, but he rose. She handed him the cigar and  struck a match and held it to one end while he drew at the other. Their  faces were close and she gave him a smile of warm and spontaneous  friendliness.    
Thought Mr. Kirkpatrick: "Oh, Lord, she's got me. I'd better make tracks  out of here. If she was a vamp like that Bascom woman she wouldn't get me  one little bit. Plenty of them where I come from. But she's plain goddess  with eyes like headlights on an engine."    
Perturbed as he was, however, he resumed his seat and drew appreciatively  at the finest cigar that had ever come his way. It had the opportune effect  of causing his class-hatred to flame afresh. No fear that he would be made  soft by teaching in the homes of these pampered cats. For the moment he  hated Alexina, seated in a carved high-back Italian chair like a young  queen on a throne.    
"Well," he growled. "Let's get to business. I've brought Spargo. Marx is  too much for me. He's terrible dull and involved. He was so taken up with  his subject, I guess, that he forgot to learn how to write about it so's  people without much time and education could understand without getting a  pain in their beans. Of course I've heard him expounded many times from the  platform, but there must have been about fifty Marxes, for I've heard--or  read--just about that many expounders of him and no two agree so's you'd  notice it. That, to my mind, is the only stumbling block for socialism  --that we have a prophet who's so hard to understand.    
"So, I've settled on Spargo. He has the name of being about the best  student of Marx and of socialism generally--it's split up quite a bit--and  he's easy reading. I fetched him along."    
He produced "Socialism" from his hat and hesitated. "I don't know noth--a  thing about teaching."    
"Oh, don't let that worry you," drawled Sibyl Bascom in her low voluptuous  voice and transfixing him with narrow swimming eyes; then as he refused to  be overcome, she continued more humanly: "We've been to lots of classes,  you know. There are all sorts of methods. Suppose one of us reads the first  chapter aloud and then you expound. That is, we'll ask you questions."    
"That's fine," said Mr. Kirkpatrick with immense relief. "Fire away."    
And Alexina, who always read prefaces and introductions last, began with  "Robert Owen and the Utopian Spirit."
