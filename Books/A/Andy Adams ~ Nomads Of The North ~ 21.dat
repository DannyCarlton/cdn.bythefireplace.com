  It was late the night of the big feast at Post Fort O' God that   MacDonnell, the factor, sent for Challoner. Challoner was  preparing  for bed when an Indian boy pounded on the door of his  shack and a  moment later gave him the message. He looked at his  watch. It was  eleven o'clock. What could the Factor want of him at  that hour, he  wondered? Flat on his belly near the warm box stove  Miki watched his  new-found master speculatively as he pulled on  his boots. His eyes  were wide open now. Challoner had washed from  him the blood of the  terrific fight of that afternoon. 
  &quot;Something to do with that devil of a Durant,&quot; growled Challoner,   looking at the battle-scarred dog. &quot;Well, if he hopes to get YOU   again, Miki, he's barking up the wrong tree. You're MINE!&quot; 
  Miki thumped his hard tail on the floor and wriggled toward his   master in mute adoration. Together they went out into the night. 
  It was a night of white moonlight and a multitude of stars. The   four great fires over which the caribou had roasted for the savage   barbecue that day were still burning brightly. In the edge of the   forest that ringed in the Post were the smouldering embers of a  score  of smaller fires. Back of these fires were faintly outlined  the gray  shadows of teepees and tents. In these shelters the three  hundred  halfbreeds and Indians who had come in from the forest  trails to the  New Year carnival at the Post were sleeping. Only  here and there was  there a movement of life. Even the dogs were  quiet after the earlier  hours of excitement and gluttony. 
  Past the big fires, with their huge spits still standing,   Challoner passed toward the Factor's quarters. Miki sniffed at the   freshly picked bones. Beyond these bones there was no sign of the  two  thousand pounds of flesh that had roasted that day on the  spits. Men,  women, children, and dogs had stuffed themselves until  there was  nothing left. It was the silence of Mutai&#8212;the &quot;belly  god&quot;&#8212;the god  who eats himself to sleep each night&#8212;that hovered  strangely over this  Post of Fort O' God, three hundred miles from  civilization. 
  There was a light in the Factor's room, and Challoner entered with   Miki at his heels. MacDonnell, the Scotchman, was puffing moodily  on  his pipe. There was a worried look in his ruddy face as the  younger  man seated himself, and his eyes were on Miki. 
  &quot;Durant has been here,&quot; he said. &quot;He's ugly. I'm afraid of   trouble. If you hadn't struck him&#8212;&quot; 
  Challoner shrugged his shoulders as he filled his own pipe from   the Factor's tobacco. 
  &quot;You see&#8212;you don't just understand the situation at Fort 0' God,&quot;   went on MacDonnell. &quot;There's been a big dog fight here at New Year   for the last fifty years. It's become a part of history, a part of   Fort O' God itself, and that's why in my own fifteen years here I   haven't tried to stop it. I believe it would bring on a sort of&#8212;   revolution. I'd wager a half of my people would go to another post   with their furs. That's why all the sympathy seems to be with  Durant.  Even Grouse Piet, his rival, tells him he's a fool to let  you get away  with him that way. Durant says that dog is HIS.&quot; 
  MacDonnell nodded at Miki, lying at Challoner's feet. 
  &quot;Then he lies,&quot; said Challoner quietly. 
  &quot;He says he bought him of Jacques Le Beau.&quot; 
  &quot;Then Le Beau sold a dog that didn't belong to him.&quot; 
  For a moment MacDonnell was silent. Then he said: 
  &quot;But that wasn't what I had you come over for, Challoner. Durant   told me something that froze my blood to-night. Your outfit starts   for your post up in the Reindeer Lake county to-morrow, doesn't  it?&quot; 
  &quot;In the morning.&quot; 
  &quot;Then could you, with one of my Indians and a team, arrange to   swing around by way of the Jackson's Knee? You'd lose a week, but  you  could overtake your outfit before it reached the Reindeer&#8212;and  it  would be a mighty big favour to me. There's a&#8212;a HELL of a  thing  happened over there.&quot; 
  Again he looked at Miki. 
  &quot;GAWD!&quot; he breathed. 
  Challoner waited. He thought he saw a shudder pass through the   Factor's shoulders. 
  &quot;I'd go myself&#8212;I ought to, but this frosted lung of mine has made   me sit tight this winter, Challoner. I OUGHT to go. Why&#8212;(a sudden   glow shot into his eyes)&#8212;I knew this Nanette Le Beau when she was  SO  HIGH, fifteen years ago. I watched her grow up, Challoner. If I  hadn't  been married&#8212;then&#8212;I'd have fallen in love with her. Do  you know her,  Challoner? Did you ever see Nanette Le Beau?&quot; 
  Challoner shook his head. 
  &quot;An angel&#8212;if God ever made one,&quot; declared MacDonnell through his   red beard. &quot;She lived over beyond the Jackson's Knee with her  father.  And he died, froze to death crossing Red Eye Lake one  night. I've  always thought Jacques Le Beau MADE her marry him  after that. Or else  she didn't know, or was crazed, or frightened  at being alone. Anyway,  she married him. It was five years ago I  saw her last. Now and then  I've heard things, but I didn't  believe&#8212;not all of them. I didn't  believe that Le Beau beat her,  and knocked her down when he wanted to.  I didn't believe he  dragged her through the snow by her hair one day  until she was  nearly dead. They were just rumours, and he was seventy  miles  away. But I believe them now. Durant came from their place, and  I  guess he told me a whole lot of the truth&#8212;to save that dog.&quot; 
  Again he looked at Miki. 
  &quot;You see, Durant tells me that Le Beau caught the dog in one of   his traps, took him to his cabin, and tortured him into shape for  the  big fight. When Durant came he was so taken with the dog that  he  bought him, and it was while Le Beau was driving the dog mad in  his  cage to show his temper that Nanette interfered. Le Beau  knocked her  down, and then jumped on her and was pulling her hair  and choking her  when the dog went for him and killed him. That's  the story. Durant  told me the truth through fear that I'd have the  dog shot if he was an  out-and-out murderer. And that's why I want  you to go by way of the  Jackson's Knee. I want you to investigate,  and I want you to do what  you can for Nanette Le Beau. My Indian  will bring her back to Port O'  God.&quot; 
  With Scotch stoicism MacDonnell had repressed whatever excitement   he may have felt. He spoke quietly. But the curious shudder went   through his shoulders again. Challoner stared at him in blank   amazement. 
  &quot;You mean to say that Miki&#8212;this dog&#8212;has killed a man?&quot; 
  &quot;Yes. He killed him, Durant says, just as he killed Grouse Piet's   wolf-dog in the big fight to-day. UGH!&quot; As Challoner's eyes fell   slowly upon Miki, the Factor added: &quot;But Grouse Piet's dog was  better  than the man. If what I hear about Le Beau was true he's  better dead  than alive. Challoner, if you didn't think it too much  trouble, and  could go that way&#8212;and see Nanette&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;I'll go,&quot; said Challoner, dropping a hand to Miki's head. 
  For half an hour after that MacDonnell told him the things he knew   about Nanette Le Beau. When Challoner rose to go the Factor  followed  him to the door. 
  &quot;Keep your eyes open for Durant,&quot; he warned. &quot;That dog is worth   more to him than all his winnings to-day, and they say his stakes   were big. He won heavily from Grouse Piet, but the halfbreed is  thick  with him now. I know it. So watch out.&quot; 
  Out in the open space, in the light of the moon and stars,   Challoner stood far a moment with Miki's forepaws resting against  his  breast. The dog's head was almost on a level with his  shoulders. 
  &quot;D'ye remember when you fell out of the canoe, Boy?&quot; he asked   softly. &quot;Remember how you 'n' the cub were tied in the bow, an'  you  got to scrapping and fell overboard just above the rapids?  Remember?  By Jove! those rapids pretty near got ME, too. I thought  you were  dead, sure&#8212;both of you. I wonder what happened to the  cub?&quot; 
  Miki whined in response, and his whole body trembled. 
  &quot;And since then you've killed a man,&quot; added Challoner, as if he   still could not quite believe. &quot;And I'm to take you back to the   woman. That's the funny thing about it. You're going back to HER,  and  if she says kill you&#8212;&quot; 
  He dropped Miki's forefeet and went on to the cabin. At the   threshold a low growl rose in Miki's throat. Challoner laughed,  and  opened the door. They went in, and the dog's growl was a  menacing  snarl. Challoner had left his lamp burning low, and in  the light of it  he saw Henri Durant and Grouse Piet waiting for  him. He turned up the  wick, and nodded. 
  &quot;Good evening. Pretty late for a call, isn't it?&quot; 
  Grouse Piet's stolid face did not change its expression. It struck   Challoner, as he glanced at him, that in head and shoulders he  bore a  grotesque resemblance to a walrus. Durant's eyes were dully  ablaze.  His face was swollen where Challoner had struck him. Miki,  stiffened  to the hardness of a knot, and still snarling under his  breath, had  crawled under Challoner's bunk. Durant pointed to him. 
  &quot;We've come after that dog,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;You can't have him, Durant,&quot; replied Challoner, trying hard to   make himself appear at ease in a situation that sent a chill up  his  back. As he spoke he was making up his mind why Grouse Piet  had come  with Durant. They were giants, both of them: more than  that&#8212;monsters.  Instinctively he had faced them with the small  table between them.  &quot;I'm sorry I lost my temper out there,&quot; he  continued. &quot;I shouldn't  have struck you, Durant. It wasn't your  fault&#8212;and I apologize. But  the dog is mine. I lost him over in  the Jackson's Knee country, and if  Jacques Le Beau caught him in a  trap, and sold him to you, he sold a  dog that didn't belong to  him. I'm willing to pay you back what you  gave for him, just to be  fair. How much was it?&quot; 
  Grouse Piet had risen to his feet. Durant came to the opposite   edge of the table, and leaned over it. Challoner wondered how a   single blow had knocked him down. 
  &quot;Non, he is not for sale.&quot; Durant's voice was low; so low that it   seemed to choke him to get it out. It was filled with a repressed   hatred. Challoner saw the great cords of his knotted hands bulging   under the skin as he gripped the edge of the table. &quot;M'sieu, we  have  come for that dog. Will you let us take him?&quot; 
  &quot;I will pay you back what you gave for him, Durant. I will add to   the price.&quot; 
  &quot;Non. He is mine. Will you give him back&#8212;NOW?&quot; 
  &quot;No!&quot; 
  Scarcely was the word out of his mouth when Durant flung his whole   weight and strength against the table. Challoner had not expected  the  move&#8212;just yet. With a bellow of rage and hatred Durant was  upon him,  and under the weight of the giant he crashed to the  floor. With them  went the table and lamp. There was a vivid  splutter of flame and the  cabin was in darkness, except where the  moon-light flooded through the  one window. Challoner had looked  for something different. He had  expected Durant to threaten before  he acted, and, sizing up the two of  them, he had decided to reach  the edge of his bunk during the  discussion. Under the pillow was  his revolver. It was too late now.  Durant was on him, fumbling in  the darkness for his throat, and as he  flung one arm upward to get  a hook around the Frenchman's neck he  heard Grouse Piet throw the  table back. The next instant they were  rolling in the moonlight on  the floor, and Challoner caught a glimpse  of Grouse Piet's huge  bulk bending over them. Durant's head was  twisted under his arm,  but one of the giant's hands had reached his  throat. The halfbreed  saw this, and he cried out something in a  guttural voice. With a  tremendous effort Challoner rolled himself and  his adversary out  of the patch of light into darkness again. Durant's  thick neck  cracked. Again Grouse Piet called out in that guttural,   questioning voice. Challoner put every ounce of his energy into  the  crook of his arm, and Durant did not answer. 
  Then the weight of Grouse Piet fell upon them, and his great hands   groped for Challoner's neck. His thick fingers found Durant's  beard  first, then fumbled for Challoner, and got their hold. Ten  seconds of  their terrific grip would have broken his neck. But the  fingers never  closed. A savage cry of agony burst from Grouse  Piet's lips, and with  that cry, ending almost in a scream, came  the snap of great jaws and  the rending snarl of fangs in the  darkness. Durant heard, and with a  great heave of his massive body  he broke free from Challoner's grip,  and leapt to his feet. In a  flash Challoner was at his bunk, facing  his enemies with the  revolver in his hand. 
  Everything had happened quickly. Scarcely more than a minute had   passed since the overturning of the table, and now, in the moment   when the situation had turned in his favour, a sudden swift and   sickening horror seized upon Challoner. Bloody and terrible there   rose before him the one scene he had witnessed that day in the big   cage where Miki and the wolf-dog had fought. And there&#8212;in that   darkness of the cabin&#8212; 
  He heard a moaning cry and the crash of a body to the floor. 
  &quot;Miki, Miki,&quot; he cried. &quot;Here! Here!&quot; 
  He dropped his revolver and sprang to the door, flinging it wide   open. 
  &quot;For God's sake get out!&quot; he cried. &quot;GET OUT!&quot; 
  A bulk dashed past him into the night. He knew it was Durant. Then   he leapt to the dark shadows on the floor and dug his two hands  into  the loose hide at the back of Miki's neck, dragging him back,  and  shouting his name. He saw Grouse Piet crawling toward the  door. He saw  him rise to his feet, silhouetted for a moment  against the starlight,  and stagger out into the night. And then he  felt Miki's weight  slinking down to the floor, and under his hands  the dog's muscles grew  limp and saggy. For two or three minutes he  continued to kneel beside  him before he closed the cabin door and  lighted another lamp. He set  up the overturned table and placed  the lamp on it. Miki had not moved.  He lay flat on his belly, his  head between his forepaws, looking up at  Challoner with a mute  appeal in his eyes. 
  Challoner reached out his two arms. 
  &quot;Miki!&quot; 
  In an instant Miki was up against him, his forefeet against his   breast, and with his arms about the dog's shoulders Challoner's  eyes  took in the floor. On it were wet splashes and bits of torn  clothing. 
  His arms closed more tightly. 
  &quot;Miki, old boy, I'm much obliged,&quot; he said.
