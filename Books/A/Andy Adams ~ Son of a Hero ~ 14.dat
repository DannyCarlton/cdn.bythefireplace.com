  Van Gaff, well past his fortieth year and now confidential agent of   the Great Lakes Salvage Company, was on what he mentally described as   the assignment of his life. He knew that if he succeeded in this   present mission he would be regarded as one of the greatest salvage   hustlers on the lakes. 
  He had carefully laid his plans, and in his mind he foresaw their   culmination. Already he considered that he held within his grasp the   fortune he had gone out to seek. In his wallet were checks which   called for one hundred thousand dollars. Van Gaff was to spend that   much, if necessary. With it he was to purchase a treasure-ship which   had been lost a decade before, with half a million dollars' worth of   ingot copper in her hold. He was to get her for a song if he could;   and, if necessary, he was to lie to conceal the fact that his company   had discovered the vessel, deep-sunk in the edge of Georgian Bay.   These were the instructions of the head men at Buffalo. 
  For an hour Van Gaff had been comfortably ensconced in one of the   cabins of the Belle Isle, Captain James Falkner in command, upbound   for the Soo. He smoked incessantly, and as he smoked he pictured again   the tragic story of the copper-ship. Of course, he had all of the   facts at his tongue's-end. The vessel had disappeared after a daybreak   mutiny during which the master had been dangerously wounded before he   had a chance to observe the ship's position&#8212;before he could realize   the need to do so&#8212;and no man of her crew had ever returned to tell of   the fate that had overtaken her. Then had come the unavailing search   by the man who owned the ship and the red metal in her. That man, he   had been told, was now living in comparative poverty at the Soo.   Perhaps Van Gaff could buy him out for a few thousand. 
  Up out of the pearl-grey mist of the morning came the copper-ship.  In  her hold was a treasure in red metal from the Michigan mines. Near  her  wheel lay a dead man. Amidships a group of sailors, armed with  knives  and pistols, stood half faltering, facing the captain's cabin.  In that  cabin kneeled Jimmy Bosworth, and beside him, her face white  with  fear, was the girl for whom he was risking his life. 
  Captain Jimmy's face was red with blood. A trail of it led to the   barred door, and between his knees a pool of it had gathered. The   man's pistol hand trembled weakly as he levelled his blue-steel   revolver. 
  &quot;I guess they ain't coming any farther, Mi-Miss Williams,&quot; he   faltered. The man was scarcely conscious of his terrible wound. He   knew that he was losing blood quite freely, and the objects around him   were very slowly fading away. If he had known more, he would not have   turned. 
  The girl's pale face became whiter still as she looked at Captain   Jimmy. But the young man failed to notice it. 
  &quot;You must let me tie up your head, Captain&#8212;&quot; 
  Something choked back the words. If Captain Jimmy could have used  his  eyes well he would have seen that the girl was crying. But Jimmy  was  losing himself. He knew that the treasure-mad crew were outside   preparing to take his life and hers, and that the girl near him was   the owner's daughter. Beyond that he only knew that he must shoot   through the door when he heard the sound of feet. He had great reason   for keeping this in mind and for battling against the weakness that   was overpowering him. From the time they had played together as little   children Captain Jimmy had loved this girl. When he was given his   first ship, only a few months before, he had asked her if he might   still love her and hope some day to call her his wife. The girl's   answer had nearly broken his heart. 
  Now she was going to Detroit, in his care, and he must take her  there  safely. 
  A sudden sound outside brought the wounded man to his senses. Men  were  approaching. Captain Jimmy could hear their feet and the voice of  one  of them talking. They came in a clumsy, stumbling way, as though   bearing a heavy object, and though the man with the revolver could   scarcely grasp the true situation, the girl beside him did. 
  &quot;Jim&#8212;Jim&#8212;they're going to knock down the door!&quot; she cried. 
  The captain seemed to hear and comprehend as though just awakening   from a sleep. One word burned in his brain, and that was his own name.   He knew that the girl had called him Jim, and that, as he levelled his   revolver, a supporting arm encircled his shoulder and a warm little   hand grasped his own. That encouraged him, and he fired. The girl saw   a tiny black spot come like a lightning flash in the panel of the   cabin door, and in an instant another bullet bit its way through, a   few inches below. From outside there came a cry of pain, then the   falling of a heavy object; and Captain Jimmy leaned back against the   girl with a faint smile. &quot;I guess I fixed one of 'em,&quot; he said. &quot;Oh,   God, how I wish I could see!&quot; 
  &quot;You must let me bind your head,&quot; replied the girl softly. She  lowered  the man gently to the floor and hurriedly wet a towel in a  pail of  water. Her beautiful eyes grew big with agony as she bathed  away the  blood. She felt certain that Captain Jimmy would never see  again. As  she tied the towel around the wound the man struggled feebly  to a  sitting posture. 
  &quot;I can't see t' shoot,&quot; he pleaded; &quot;please take&#8212;&quot; 
  The girl's hands helped to support him where he sat. &quot;Jim,&quot; she   whispered, &quot;do you remember how you taught me to shoot with the old   horse-pistol when we were children? Well, I'm going to do the shooting   now!&quot; She caught up the big revolver, cocked it, and laid it beside   her on the floor. Then she put her arms around Captain Jimmy and   gently drew him back against the wall. 
  &quot;It's a good thing I've got the only big gun aboard,&quot; said the   captain, as if talking to himself. &quot;If I 'adn't they'd soon get our   range through the door.&quot; 
  The ship-owner's daughter picked up the revolver again, and,  steadying  her arm over the back of a chair, levelled it coolly at the  black  spots Captain Jimmy had made. Outside there was an ominous  quiet. The  girl listened for a time; then she said, without taking her  glance  from the little spots: &quot;Jim, why didn't you let them kill me?  They  would not have hurt you; they wanted you to join them.&quot; 
  The blinded man groped out with his hands. The girl heard his move,   but did not look behind. &quot;Mildred, ain't I&#8212;ain't I fought for you a   hundred times&#8212;when we were kids?&quot; 
  &quot;You bet you did, Jim!&quot; 
  This time the girl turned and looked down upon the huddled figure   against the wall. Her face was wet with tears, but there was a smile   upon her lips and a look in her eyes that would have made Captain   Jimmy's heart leap with joy could he have seen them. 
  &quot;You were my hero then&#8212;and now.&quot; 
  There came a rap on the door as if some one were tapping it with a   long stick. The big revolver wavered for a moment between the two   black spots; and then a third came, to the right and a little high.   Before the girl could fire again a voice called from the deck. 
  &quot;Don't shoot ag'in, Cap'n Bosworth, I want t' talk with y'!&quot;  Captain  Jimmy recognized his mate's voice. &quot;We want t' give y' one  more  chance, Cap'n. We'll give y' a third of the copper aboard if y'll  jine  us 'n' give up th' girl.&quot; 
  Mildred felt something touch her arm. It was the captain's hand. He   groped blindly for a moment. &quot;Milly&#8212;Milly&#8212;please give me th' gun!&quot;   he whispered. &quot;Will y' answer, Cap'n Bosworth?&quot; came the voice from   outside. &quot;Th' girl's got t' go down with th' ship. We've got our   reckonin', 'n' nobody kin salvage the copper but us. If y' don't jine   us, we'll send y' t' hell along o' th' girl&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Please&#8212;please give me th' gun, Milly!&quot; almost sobbed Captain  Jimmy.  He reached up, a pathetic figure, swaying weakly on his knees.  In  place of the revolver the girl put one of her hands in his and then   she fired again through the panel of the door. 
  There came a yell of rage from outside. 
  &quot;Curse y'! If that's yer answer, Cap'n Bosworth, we'll send y' t'  hell  with pleasure.&quot; 
  The girl smiled. Her white teeth gleamed between her red lips and  her  bosom rose and fell with excitement. But she was taking courage  from  Captain Jimmy. She listened for a sound outside that might guide   another shot, but in place of that there came a throbbing of the floor   under her feet, and, in a sudden spasm, the wounded man almost crushed   the little hand he held. 
  &quot;They're stopping th' engines!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Here&#8212;&quot; Captain  Jimmy  held up a box of cartridges. The girl took them and counted out  six  while her companion broke the breech of the gun. After she had   reloaded the weapon, the owner's daughter tiptoed to the door and for   a full minute stood with her ear against it. When she came back the   captain was figuring on his fingers and his lips were moving. The girl   watched him. In the excitement of the last hour her hair had become   loosened and now it fell in rich waves around her shoulders. As she   leaned quietly over, attempting to catch the murmur from Captain   Jimmy's lips, a mass of it tumbled about the man's face and he caught   it in his hands before she could move away. 
  &quot;Milly&#8212;&quot; he whispered. 
  The girl gently drew her hair away. 
  &quot;What were you doing, Jim?&quot; she asked. 
  Captain Jimmy sank back on the floor. 
  &quot;Excuse&#8212;me&#8212;Miss Mildred,&quot; he mumbled Almost fiercely the girl  bent  over again so that her hair swept the man's face. But Jimmy did  not  touch it. &quot;I was figurin' where we were,&quot; he continued &quot;If you get   away, Miss Mildred, tell your father they scuttled th' ship somewhere   on a line b'tween Hammond's Bay 'n' Grand Manitoulin Island. I reckon   she'll go down in&#8212;fifteen fathom&#8212;-&quot; 
  In a moment the girl was upon her knees beside him. 
  &quot;And you, Jim&#8212;you&#8212;you&#8212;&quot; 
  Captain Jimmy raised a hand to his head. 
  &quot;I'm burning up!&quot; he gasped. &quot;I shouldn't wonder, Miss Milly&#8212;&quot; He   slowly wavered and fell back. With a cry of agony the girl caught him   in her arms. &quot;Oh, my God&#8212;Jim&#8212;Jim, my darling&#8212;&quot; She pressed her lips   passionately upon the dead-white face against her breast, but Captain   Jimmy did not know it. For a few minutes the owner's daughter held him   pressed to her, sobbing over him, kissing his hair and beseeching the   man to speak. &quot;I love you, Jim&#8212;I love you&#8212;I love you&#8212;&quot; she repeated   again and again. &quot;I love you&#8212;I love you&#8212;oh, I love you so!&quot; 
  Captain Jimmy was dreaming. He dreamed that his boyhood sweetheart  had  not refused him, and that she had become his wife. It was a long   dream, but the same thing over and over again, and so pleasant that he   thought he was always smiling. When he awoke again somebody was   bathing his head in cold water, and he sighed deeply. 
  &quot;Are you feeling better, Jim?&quot; asked a voice. 
  Captain Jimmy came to his senses with a powerful effort. &quot;I feel   better, Miss Mildred&#8212;I guess I've been sleeping!&quot; The man   straightened. Then he sniffed the air. He seemed to be in a different   atmosphere&#8212;hot, stifling. A crackling sound rilled his ears, too, and   he staggered to his knees, the girl's arm supporting him. 
  &quot;Milly&#8212;&quot; His voice was full of inquiry. 
  &quot;It's the ship, Jim,&quot; she whispered. &quot;She's sinking, and they've  set  fire to her, too. They left nearly an hour ago. You and I are the  only  ones aboard, Jim.&quot; 
  The girl spoke in a calm, sweet voice. She brushed back Captain   Jimmy's hair and half bent over as if to kiss him, but caught herself   and only smiled into his sightless face. &quot;I tried to pull you out,&quot;   she continued, &quot;but I couldn't.&quot; 
  Captain Jimmy staggered to his feet. He was stronger, but his eyes   burned terribly. &quot;You wouldn't leave me, then&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;No, Jim.&quot; 
  The two made their way slowly to the cabin door, the girl straining  to  hold up half of the man's weight. Jimmy reached out and drew the  bolt.  As the door opened a breath of hot air struck him in the face  and his  nostrils were filled with smoke. For a moment he stood there  and  listened. There was no sound of the sea lapping the ship's sides.   There was no singing of the wind in the spars overhead. All was lost   in a sullen rumbling that seemed to freeze Captain Jimmy's blood. 
  &quot;She's burning deep down,&quot; he said. &quot;The fire ain't more'n  amidships  in the hold. I don't believe there's any danger&#8212;yet.&quot;  Captain Jimmy  lied bravely. The girl knew that he was lying and looked  at him as  though she would have liked to take him in her arms again. 
  &quot;I don't believe there is either, Jim.&quot; 
  But the girl could see. Away aft, the cook's cabin, and everything   behind it, was a mass of flames. Out of the midship hatch poured a   cloud of smoke and now and then a column of fire shot out with it.   Even as the two stood there, hand in hand, there came a jarring   explosion under their feet. 
  &quot;Milly, I must see&#8212;I must see!&quot; cried the captain. He tried to  pull  the towel from his eyes, but the ship-owner's daughter stopped  him. 
  &quot;You mustn't take it off, Jim,&quot; she pleaded. &quot;It will blind you if  you  do. And there's nothing that you can do. The boats are gone. There   were only two life-preservers in your cabin and&#8212;&quot; The girl caught   herself suddenly. Captain Jimmy had now noticed the preserver about   his waist, and he began to fumble at it. Again his hands were caught   in those of his companion. 
  &quot;They're on&#8212;I mean it's on all right, Jim!&quot; 
  There was something almost pleading in the girl's voice. The man   straightened as if he had been struck a blow. He reached out, but the   girl eluded him. Once more he groped and caught her by the arm. With   all his strength he pulled her to him. &quot;You've put them both on me,   Milly!&quot; His voice trembled with excitement. &quot;You've put them both on   me&#8212;&quot; 
  It seemed as if his old strength had returned to him. He held the  girl  in a grip that hurt her as be worked one of the life-preservers  over  his head and then slipped it over the shoulders of the owner's   daughter. When it was done he was conscious of a great pain in his   head and a sudden weakness. 
  &quot;Milly&#8212;I&#8212;I&#8212;didn't think y'd play me like that!&quot; he gasped. 
  There came a detonation from under their feet and a pillar of fire   leaped out of the midship hatch. Nothing else in the world sounds like   the rumbling of fire in a ship's hold. For a time there is a rolling,   muffled roar, punctuated by explosions which become louder as the fire   grows hotter. Then the end comes like a powder-flash, and instead of a   smouldering hulk, a thing hidden in flames rolls upon the sea. It was   not the first time that Captain Jimmy had heard that sound under his   feet, and he knew that the end was not far away. He measured the   throbbing of the deck and could tell that the fire had passed the   midship hatches and was burning forward like a furnace. Unperceived by   the girl, he drew the towel down from his eyes. There came a stinging,   biting pain as the smoke and heat touched his wound&#8212;but no sight. He   put the towel back, and from deep down in his soul there struggled a   faint cry of anguish. &quot;My God&#8212;I&#8212;I&#8212;wish I could see!&quot; 
  The girl turned to him again. &quot;You'll see after a time, but you   mustn't lift the bandage, Jim,&quot; she said. She took the man by his hand   and led him around the end of the cabin. A steady pillar of fire now   poured out of the midship hatch, and the owner's daughter held up her   skirt to protect Captain Jimmy's face from the heat as she slowly led   him into the bow. 
  &quot;Is the for'rd boat gone, Milly?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;It's gone, Jim.&quot; 
  &quot;'N' the rafts?&quot; 
  &quot;They threw them overboard, Jim.&quot; 
  Captain Jimmy caught hold of the ship's rail as the girl brought  him  to it and leaned over. He could smell the clouds of smoke that  were  pouring from somewhere along the water-line. &quot;Oh, God, if I could  only  see!&quot; he cried again. 
  &quot;What would you do, Jim&#8212;what would you do?&quot; The girl caught him   eagerly by the arm. &quot;Be my captain, Jim&#8212;and I'll be the crew! I can   do anything&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Wood and a rope,&quot; cried the man. &quot;Milly, has the fire reached the   cabin?&quot; 
  &quot;Not yet&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Then take me back!&quot; almost shouted Captain Jimmy. &quot;We must have  th'  table&#8212;and there's a rope under it!&quot;, 
  &quot;Stay here, Jim, and I'll get them!&quot; In an instant the girl had  gone.  Captain Jimmy shouted for her to return, then groaned and waited  as he  received no reply. 
  Abaft the midship hatch the copper-ship was now wreathed in flames.   The muffled thunder under the deck was lost in the crackling, snapping   roar of the superstructure, and the heat that came from it almost   stifled the girl as she bowed her head and plunged into the smothering   clouds of smoke. Almost blindly she felt her way along the side of the   cabin until she came to the door. The room was filled with smoke, and   in one corner of it lurid tongues of flame were licking their way up   to the wall from the bursting door. Almost sobbing for breath, she   caught up the rope, ran to the door and flung it forward. She heard a   shout from Captain Jimmy&#8212;a shout that had in it warning and terror&#8212;   but she hurried back again without losing a gasp of breath in reply&#8212;   One end of the cabin was spreading into a sheet of flame. The girl   could feel her face blistering in its heat, but she tugged at the long   table and dragged it foot by foot toward the cabin door. Each moment   her strength seemed going. She knew that she was suffocating, almost   burning, but still she fought, with the deck crashing in half a dozen   yards away and the cabin fire almost at her feet. 
  Out upon the deck she stumbled and fell. For a moment she felt as   though she would like to lie there and rest; then came reason and one   more effort to reach Captain Jim. The table dragged like lead. Through   the smoke the fire seemed to be gaining upon the panting girl. It shot   up until it wrapped the spars in a shrieking mass and the whole end of   the ship went in with a thundering explosion. Around the ship the sea   was turned into a boiling caldron and clouds of hot steam poured about   the fighting girl. Her heart seemed bursting for want of air. One   foot&#8212;two&#8212;three, inch by inch she made them! The girl heard shouts   near her, but she could not answer. Then she backed into something,   and was conscious that Captain Jimmy was there helping her, and she   tugged all the harder&#8212;tugged&#8212;tugged&#8212;until the table slid out into   the free air of the bow, and there she turned and put her arm around   the man's neck. 
  &quot;Oh, Jim&#8212;Jim&#8212;-&quot; she whispered in a breaking sob. 
  Captain Jimmy held her close to him. He would have stood like that   until the fire had utterly consumed him, but in a moment the girl took   his arms away. 
  &quot;We must hurry, Jim!&quot; she said. 
  She caught up the rope from the deck and gave it to the man. With   trembling hands Captain Jimmy cut it into three lengths. One of these   he fastened around the girl's waist, another around his own, and then   he tied the three ends to the table. The free end of the third rope he   fastened to the rail of the ship. When this was done he lowered the   table over the side, the girl helping bravely. 
  &quot;You must climb down the rope, Milly,&quot; he said, &quot;We're all tied   together. We can't lose&#8212;&quot; Another section of the deck crashed in   behind them. With it there came another sound&#8212;a sound which Captain   Jimmy had been straining his ears to catch since he had come to   consciousness in the cabin. It was the rush of in pouring water.   Captain Jimmy knew well that the last moments of the ship had arrived.   &quot;Quick&#8212;quick!&quot; he cried. 
  His voice spoke their danger. The running of the water was changing   into a hollow roar. In an instant the girl was over the side and her   voice came up cheerfully to the man. &quot;I'm here, Jim.&quot; 
  Captain Jimmy slipped over and swung down the rope. He bit hard on  the  handle of a knife between his teeth, and, as his partly submerged  body  rested in the water, he seized the knife in his hand and pressed  its  blade against the rope. 
  &quot;Are you right, Milly, girl?&quot; 
  &quot;I'm not only right&#8212;I'm comfortable,&quot; replied the girl. 
  The man pressed hard and the rope parted. Then he began working his   feet and arms in the water and slowly the table drifted away. Each   moment the roaring of the burning ship grew less distinct. Soon the   noise of rushing water died away, and Captain Jimmy ceased to paddle.   With difficulty he pulled himself half upon the table, and the girl   put one of her arms around his shoulder. 
  &quot;How far, Milly&#8212;&quot; 
  He did not finish. Her eyes big with excitement and horror, the  girl  stared at the ship. The blazing stern shot up into the air, and  like a  hissing rocket the copper-ship sank into the sea. There went up  a  spout of milk-white steam, and then there came a rolling of the  water  under the table. After that there fell a strange quiet in the  air, and  Captain Jimmy's face was death-like as he turned it toward  the sky  that he would never see again. 
  &quot;She's gone, Milly&#8212;&quot; A boyish sob almost choked him. &quot;She's gone&#8212;   I've&#8212;lost&#8212;my&#8212;first&#8212;ship&#8212;&#8212;&quot; 
  In the path of the copper-ship that day there came a freighter, but  it  was many hours later. She picked up a young man and a younger  woman&#8212;  both badly burned and one blind&#8212;far from where the treasure  craft had  been scuttled. 
  From the experience of earlier days Van Gaff knew that a hungry  man,  or a man who is poor, will snatch at small things. He himself had  done  it in the days which had made him what some people called a   misanthrope. He had been throttled, he had been held down by adversity   until he was black in the face and while he was down everything that   he had ever cared for had gone out of his life. 
  Then he had made a titanic struggle and had risen like a man with  the  soul burned out of him. He had been successful; he had made money;  but  the love for men and women had gone out of him. He lived because  his  heart persisted in beating, not because he found especial pleasure  in  it, and he worked hard because work seemed to be the only thing  left  for him to do. 
  It was this way with Van Gaff now. The story of the ill-fated  copper-  ship had aroused no enthusiasm in him. In fact, he was quite   unresponsive to the romance in it. To-night, as on most other nights,   he was in what he called the rut. His loneliness was with him,   illimitable as ever, and he sat and brooded as he had done a thousand   times before, and something in him went back yearningly to the days   before the rut existed for him, when he was like other people and   enjoyed himself as they did. From his thoughts he was aroused by the   ringing of a telephone hanging against the wall of the cabin. 
  &quot;Hello, Van Gaff, this is Falkner,&quot; he heard. &quot;I want you to come  over  and join us in a game of poker. There's a&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Much obliged, Captain, but I'm feeling a little under the weather  to-  night,&quot; interrupted Van Gaff. &quot;I&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;There's a girl!&quot; cut in the captain. &quot;She asked me to invite you   over, and I don't see how you're going to get out of it. We're waiting   for you.&quot; The receiver at the other end went up with a bang and Van   Gaff returned leisurely to his chair, a puzzled look in his face. 
  &quot;What the&#8212;? A girl&#8212;poker&#8212;&quot; he mused. The sullen dejection in his   eyes was chased out by a gleam of humour. A vitally human spot in him   had been touched. &quot;Devilish funny,&quot; he smiled, lighting another cigar.   &quot;A girl&#8212;poker&#8212;in the captain's cabin!&quot; 
  The idea tickled Van Gaff. &quot;I wonder&#8212;&quot; What he wondered he left   unsaid, but there came into his face an expression of curiosity, of   hesitancy, of doubt. &quot;Guess I'll go,&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Guess I'll see&#8212;-&quot;   He laced his shoes, rearranged his tie, brushed his hair and went on   deck. 
  Jennings, the first officer of the ship, opened the door when Van  Gaff  knocked, and over his shoulder the newcomer saw Captain Falkner   laughing down into the face of a girl sitting at one end of the cabin   table. 
  The salvage agent was only a casual critic of women. He observed  that  this one, sitting under the glow of the electric light, had a   glistening crown of brown hair and that her eyes, as they encountered   his own for a moment, were dark. There was nothing unusual about her,   it seemed to Van Gaff. She was pretty, but in a quiet sort of way, and   mere prettiness had for a long time ceased to interest him. 
  &quot;I thought you'd come, Van Gaff,&quot; said the captain, rising to shake   hands. &quot;It isn't often you have a chance to play poker with a pretty   girl, eh?&quot; He winked and laughed, Jennings joining in heartily. &quot;Miss   York,&quot; he cried, turning toward the girl, &quot;this is Mr. Van Gaff, one   of the swindlers attached to the Great Lakes Salvage Company. You'll   like him!&quot; 
  Van Gaff flushed, but the girl did not seem to notice. She looked  up  at him and smiled, and that smile, he thought, was one of the  sweetest  he had ever seen. 
  &quot;I'm afraid Captain Falkner may give you a bad opinion of me,&quot; he   said. He seated himself, facing the girl, while the others placed   themselves at opposite sides of the table. The first officer began   sorting out little piles of coloured chips, and while the captain   dealt, Van Gaff repeated what he had said. The girl's only reply was   another smile and the pressing of a pretty forefinger upon her lips. 
  &quot;She doesn't like to talk to strangers,&quot; rumbled Jennings. &quot;I think   it's admirable!&quot; 
  &quot;Tush-h-h-h!&quot; said the captain warningly. 
  Van Gaff felt the hot blood rushing into his face. He looked  straight  at the girl, and in her eyes there came a sudden shadow of  perplexity.  Her mouth formed itself into a red O and she shot a  suspicious glance  at the captain and then at Jennings. In a moment,  catching up a small  paper pad, she wrote a few words upon it and  handed it to Van Gaff. 
  &quot;Please don't think that I am rude,&quot; she had written. &quot;Haven't they   told you that I am deaf and dumb?&quot; 
  For an instant Van Gaff's fingers closed tightly over the pad. In  the  rut he had learned to strike, and strike suddenly, and for that  single  instant he was filled with an intense desire to even up with  the men  beside him. He turned to the captain, who was smiling broadly.  He  could feel Jennings laughing silently at his other side. In another   moment he would have responded to the spirit that was calling for   physical action, but the girl had seen a flashlight struggle in his   eyes, and now she reached out a hand and laid it gently upon his   doubled fist. It was a touch that thrilled Van Gaff. 
  &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; he scribbled in his big, almost illegible  hand.  &quot;I did not know.&quot; 
  The girl laughed over the table at him, and he wondered if he had   exhibited bad taste in getting angry at an incident which was regarded   by the others as a good joke. 
  &quot;It's all my fault,&quot; apologized Jim Falkner, his good-humoured face   red with merriment. &quot;Miss York thought I had told you. But it was too   good a chance, Van Gaff&#8212;too good&#8212;too good&#8212;&quot; 
  The girl shot a warning glance at him as she picked up her cards.  Van  Gaff watched her intently. For a moment her long lashes lay almost   upon her cheeks as she studied her hand, then her lips were pursed   into that round, red O that was beginning to fascinate Van Gaff, and   she pushed out a little pile of chips. 
  The salvage agent showed his interest. He realized that this girl,   whom he had known but a few minutes, was tremendously appealing to   him. Something in her reached out and set chords tingling in him which   he thought had died for ever in the days of the rut. 
  Twice during the first few minutes of the game he forgot the   significance of her silence and spoke to her. Each time the girl   replied with a smile which seemed filled with sadness to Van Gaff, and   which made him curse himself inwardly for his forgetfulness. For a   time he failed to notice that she was playing a splendid game, and   when Jennings called his attention to this and he saw that she   possessed two-thirds of the chips upon the table, the warmth that had   begun to glow in his heart received a sudden chill. He had his opinion   of women poker-players. 
  He wished to ask a question of the captain, but feared that the  girl  would understand. By the changing lights in her eyes and the  colour  that would come and go in her face he at times thought she read  what  the others were saying by the movement of their lips. Once while   looking hard at his cards he spoke in a low voice to the first   officer, saying that Miss York reminded him of a young woman he had   seen years before in a play. &quot;But that girl was a professional   gambler,&quot; he added, with a suggestive emphasis upon the last word. 
  When he looked across the table he saw that Miss York's face was   flushed, and as the girl's eyes encountered his own there was a look   in them which was almost accusing. Was it possible that she   understood? He would be frank&#8212;and ask her. In black and white the   question seemed impertinent and in bad taste, but he pushed the   writing across to her and watched her closely while she read it. 
  &quot;Sometimes a deaf-and-dumb person understands without hearing,&quot; she   wrote equivocally. 
  A little later the girl nodded toward the cabin clock, signifying  that  it was time for her to retire. Before rising from the table she   invited Van Gaff to escort her across the deck to her cabin, and when   the two paused before her door she gave him one of her hands, smiling   up into his face in a way that set the man's heart beating wildly. At   that moment the memory of his old life went out of him. He forgot the   copper-ship, the big checks, and the man at the Soo. His lips burned   with words which he crushed back. 
  After he had returned to his room he was sorry that he had not in  some  way let the girl know what was in his mind. He might have written  in  her tablet, he might have&#8212;-But he immediately reproached himself  for  allowing this second thought to come into his head. 
  It occurred to him then that perhaps he was making a fool of  himself.  A dozen times he asked himself why he should be so interested  in this  girl. He had known her less than two hours; she was deaf and  dumb&#8212;and  she played poker. These were things which would have fatally   prejudiced Van Gaff a short time before. But now something had risen   in revolt in his soul, he acknowledged to himself that a new interest   had come into his life, and that he was experiencing sensations which   were pleasing and which thrilled him with a desire to be near the girl   again. 
  When the salvage agent awoke in the morning his first thought was  of  the girl. For an hour he lingered over his breakfast, hoping that  she  would join him. He talked of her to the captain, who told him  simply  that Miss York lived at the Soo and that her father was a  friend whose  good opinion he cherished, but that he had not seen much  of the girl  and, consequently, knew little of her. Beyond this  information Jim  Falkner was so reticent that Van Gaff was made to feel  the  impertinence of his questions. A little later he went to his cabin  and  through his window watched for the girl's appearance on deck When  she  came from her room he hurried out to meet her. 
  &quot;I've been watching for you all the morning!&quot; he cried. &quot;I&#8212;&quot; He   caught himself, the girl laughing at his forgetfulness. Her face was   so filled with sweetness that Van Gaff's confusion was banished in an   instant. 
  He led her deep into the midship and leaned with her over the rail  of  the vessel with the nearest eyes two hundred feet away. He pointed  out  the beauties of the lake to her, and she understood him and mutely   thanked him with her eyes; he made two trips to his cabin to bring   cushions and chairs, and then for an hour he sat beside her and fell   deeper and deeper in love with her. As he watched the beautiful colour   in her face, the changing lights in her eyes, and the pouting   expressions of her red mouth, Van Gaff knew that everything that had   been in his life had now given place to this girl. The thought of her   great affliction only added to his passion. It brought her nearer to   him, for in a way they were both unfortunate; it made him feel that   there existed between them something which made up for the briefness   of their acquaintanceship. He wrote this for his companion, and she   asked him to explain. It was a big thing for Van Gaff to do. It called   for the old, long story of the man in the rut. He pencilled it, bit by   bit, and the girl urged him on. 
  When he had done he wrote under the last words: &quot;I am going to tell   you something now which may make you angry. In one night I learned to   love you&#8212;and I never loved another living creature in my life&#8212;except   a dog.&quot; 
  In a moment the colour left the girl's cheeks, and when she raised  her  eyes slowly to Van Gaff's her face was as white as the little  flower  at her throat. The man's whole soul shone in his eyes, and it  seemed  to him as though his heart for the moment had ceased to beat.  An arm's  distance away was the only salvation the earth seemed to hold  for him.  This girl had dragged him from his old life&#8212;she could hold  him from  it for ever. Without her he knew that he would fall again,  deeper than  before, and he half stretched out his arms, his lips  forming words of  entreaty. 
  The girl seemed almost on the point of speaking. Her lips trembled,   she seemed struggling to give sound to the words she wished to say,   and Van Gaff leaned eagerly toward her as though he expected to hear   her voice. In the face of his ardour she lowered her eyes and wrote in   her tablet. 
  &quot;You would not have said that if you had known more about me,&quot; he   read. &quot;I have accepted your friendship, but in allowing you to tell me   that you love me, I deceived you&#8212;deceived you so shamefully that I am   afraid to tell you how.&quot; 
  His eyes glowed and his face was filled with a white, tense   earnestness, as he wrote the reply. &quot;Deception has been a part of my   life. Sometimes deception is necessary, as it has been with me; then   it is not a sin, but just. That is my eleventh commandment, and by   obeying it I have made the world give me the little that I would not   otherwise have had. At this moment I am obeying it.&quot; He was thinking   of the copper-ship and the man at the Soo. 
  &quot;Are you deceiving me?&quot; wrote the girl. 
  In a moment he had launched himself into the story of the  copper-ship.  Briefly, strongly, he described wherein his deception  lay, and the  girl read while he wrote, her face so near to his own  that at times he  could feel her hair blowing against his cheek. Before  he had done she  drew back, and when Van Gaff looked up she was  standing, her eyes big  and staring, as though she had been frightened. 
  &quot;I must think over what you have said,&quot; she wrote when he had  returned  the tablet. &quot;I must go to my cabin. You may see me  again&#8212;soon.&quot; She  gave him her hand, and Van Gaff held it for a moment  between both of  his own. 
  He made no attempt to detain her after that. He watched her as she   walked into the forward deck. For the first remembered time in his   life Van Gaff was happy. In the beginning he had steeled himself   against disappointment. He had feared that the girl would regard his   attentions and words as impertinent, if not insulting. But she had   accepted both, and there was something in her way of receiving them   that made his heart throb with hope. 
  He loved her with the sincerity of a man in whom the great passion  was  burning for the first time, and he did not go beyond this fact.  Only  in a vague sort of way did he wonder how she had deceived him. He   believed that he had guessed something of her secret the night before,   and he felt assured that the captain could explain to him if he so   desired. But he did not care for explanations now. The girl had become   a part of his life, a part vitally necessary to his future, and   nothing could keep him from loving her. 
  Anxiously he awaited her reappearance. But the girl's dinner was   served in her cabin, and as hour after hour passed and she did not   come out on deck Van Gaff's suspense became acute. Late in the   afternoon he received a note in which she said that she was suffering   from a headache and that she was sorry she could not see him until the   next day. 
  The salvage agent was up early the following morning. He had not   noticed that the ship's engines had ceased to throb beneath his feet,   and when he came on deck and saw that the vessel was lying motionless   in the smooth sea he was greatly surprised. The captain called down to   him from the pilot-house. 
  &quot;Guess we've fractured a shaft, Mr. Van Gaff.&quot; He pointed in  disgust,  and Van Gaff, following his arm, saw an indistinct haze of  smoke a  dozen miles away. &quot;That's the Soo,&quot; explained the master, with  a  significant shrug of his shoulders. &quot;It'll cost us a good lump to  get  towed in&#8212;and it'll take us a day!&quot; 
  A sudden thrill of joy shot through Van Gaff. This delay was what  he  wanted. Every minute of it would be precious to him. His happiness   shone in his face as he ascended the pilot-house stair and asked the   captain if he had heard how Miss York was. 
  &quot;Do you see that bit of smoke?&quot; he asked, pointing toward the  distant  city. &quot;That's our launch, and Miss York is in it. She said  that it was  necessary for her to get to the Soo without delay and I  sent her on. I  have my suspicions&#8212;that you&#8212;&quot; he paused fumbled in  one of his  pockets, and handed Van Gaff a letter. &quot;She left that for  you!&quot; he  ended gruffly. Van Gaff seized upon it like an animal and  tore it  open. It began: 
  Dear Mr. Van Gaff: 
  I know that you will think me very, very wicked when you have read   this, but I hope that you will forgive me. I told you last night that   I had deceived you, but since then I have deceived you again and in a   way that will do you great injury&#8212;financially. 
  In the first place, I am neither deaf nor dumb. Please do not blame   Captain Falkner. I told him, the night that we played cards, that I   was going to have a little fun at your expense, and I got his word of   honour that he would not betray me, for I did not expect that I would   see you again after that evening. 
  Before we parted yesterday morning I would have revealed  myself&#8212;but  you spoke of a long-lost vessel, a copper-ship, which went  down years  ago. Those words sealed my lips. You told me how and where  your  company found it, and the name of its owner, and by the time you  read  this I will be on my way to that owner. 
  I almost despise myself for betraying your confidence in this way.  But  you have taught me an eleventh commandment-and I am obeying it to  the  letter. 
  Sincerely yours, 
  ELIZABETH YORK. 
  When Van Gaff turned toward Captain Falkner again his face was as  hard  as stone. Something rushed back over him like a flood, and he  knew  that the mask had fallen from him and that he was no longer a  fool,  but Van Gaff once more&#8212;the old Van Gaff, with perhaps a deeper  and  darker place waiting for him at the bottom of the rut. What little   hope there had been in him was now mangled. He had not only betrayed   himself, but his employers as well. He had allowed an adventuress to   hook and strangle him. But still&#8212;his heart throbbed as if it would   burst when he thought of her. Whatever she was, she had brought him   back into good wholesome life for a few short hours&#8212;and he loved her!   He would always love her for that. But now the old spirit in him   called for action. 
  &quot;Captain Falkner,&quot; he said, &quot;it is also necessary that I should get  to  the Soo&#8212;without delay. Over there is a yacht that will take me in.   Will you signal for her?&quot; As he spoke he handed the other the open   letter. &quot;That will explain why!&quot; he added. 
  The captain read, and when he had done he rumbled out an oath that   could be heard amidships. &quot;She's a trump!&quot; he shouted. His face became   red with excitement. Running into the pilot-house, he levelled a pair   of glasses at the distant launch, then sent a signal down into the   engine-room. 
  &quot;I'll call the yacht for you,&quot; he cried. &quot;I'll call it&#8212;because you   can't catch up with her! She'll beat you&#8212;easy! If I thought she   wouldn't I'd hold you here till doomsday! But she'll beat you&#8212;she'll   get there first&#8212;she'll&#8212;&quot; 
  The roar of the freighter's whistle interrupted him, In an unbroken   signal that clouded the aft deck with steam it called until the yacht   swung bow on and bore down within hailing distance. In response to the   captain's invitation it ran alongside, and Van Gaff swung himself down   into it. There were two young women and a man in the boat. Before any   of them had expressed their surprise at his action he had accosted the   latter, who was staring at him in blank astonishment from the stern. 
  &quot;I beg your pardon,&quot; he said, lifting his hat in acknowledgment of  the  presence of women. &quot;We've broken down. It's important that I  should  reach the Soo without a moment's delay. I will give you five  hundred  dollars if you get me there within three-quarters of an hour,  and I'll  give you a bonus of one hundred dollars for every five  minutes you  save under that time.&quot; 
  He seated himself opposite the man at the engine, pulled out his   wallet, then looked at his watch. &quot;Please don't waste a second,&quot; he   urged, as he counted out a number of bills. &quot;I'm going to pay you   three hundred in advance&#8212;I'll give you the rest when I see that you   have won.&quot; 
  The little boat was edging away from the steel wall of the ship.  Her  engine kicked up a billow of foam behind, and as the craft shot  out  with her nose pointed toward the distant city, Van Gaff handed  over  the bank-notes. Then he leaned against the cushioned rail and  silently  watched their progress. 
  Thirty minutes later he gave four fifty-dollar bills to the man at  the  engine. Ten minutes after that, as the yacht glided with dangerous   speed up to one of the low wharves of the town, he handed him two   others, and while the craft was still in motion clambered ashore. He   knew that to hunt for a cab would mean delay, so he hailed a delivery-   wagon, climbed in beside the driver, and, thrusting a bill into his   hand, told him to make the run of his life to an address which he gave   him. 
  In a few minutes the salvage agent was hurrying along a winding   cinder-path that led to an old-fashioned white house set in the midst   of a small grove. As he ascended the weather-beaten steps to the front   door he caught a glimpse of a grey-haired man through an open window,   and he felt assured that this was the man he had come to see. A moment   after he had knocked an elderly woman came to the door, received his   card, and ushered him into a small reception-room. 
  Van Gaff was filled with hope. It seemed evident to him that he had   beaten Miss York. He knew that the girl had landed at least half an   hour ahead of him, but it was possible that something had delayed her   after she had reached the city. The quiet, unexcited aspect of the man   he had seen and the equally calm demeanour of the woman, whom he took   to be his wife, convinced him that the couple had not yet been   approached on the subject of the copper-ship. 
  But he knew that there would be no time in which to bargain, for  the  girl might come in at any moment. He would offer fifty thousand   dollars at once. If there was a sign of hesitation on the part of the   copper-ship's owner he would increase the offer, but in a way that   would not create suspicion. He had figured this out, when light   footsteps sounded in the hall, and a moment later Miss Elizabeth York   stood in the doorway! 
  The girl wore the costume in which he had seen her aboard ship.  There  was a smile upon her lips, the sweet, soft smile that had made a  fool  of Van Gaff, and she advanced toward him, her hand outstretched. 
  &quot;Won't you please congratulate me, Mr. Van Gaff?&quot; she asked. A rich   colour suffused her face and her eyes glowed with a light that Van   Gaff had never seen in them before. &quot;Please&#8212;&quot; 
  Van Gaff had not taken her hand. He knew that he was beaten. 
  &quot;You have ruined me,&quot; he said coldly. 
  &quot;And consequently you think that I am very wicked,&quot; smiled the  girl.  &quot;But I'm not. I've just been obeying your eleventh commandment,  and by  doing it I have kept your company from stealing a fortune from  my  father. My name is not 'York.' I am Mildred Williams Bosworth.&quot;
