H<small>ARVEY</small> waked to find the &#147;first half&#148; at breakfast, the fo&#146;c&#146;sle door drawn to a crack, and every square inch of the schooner singing its own tune. The black bulk of the cook balanced behind the tiny galley over the glare of the stove, and the pots and pans in the pierced wooden board before it jarred and racketed to each plunge. Up and up the fo&#146;c&#146;sle climbed, yearning and surging and quivering, and then, with a clear, sickle-like swoop, came down into the seas. He could hear the flaring bows cut and squelch, and there was a pause ere the divided waters came down on the deck above, like a volley of buck-shot. Followed the woolly sound of the cable in the hawse-hole; a grunt and squeal of the windlass; a yaw, a punt, and a kick, and the &#147;We&#146;re Here&#148; gathered herself together to repeat the motions.
&#147;Now, ashore,&#148; he heard Long Jack saying, &#147;ye&#146;ve chores, an&#146; ye must do thim in any weather. Here we&#146;re well clear of the fleet, an&#146; we&#146;ve no chores&#151;an&#146; that&#146;s a blessin&#146;. Good night, all.&#148; He passed like a big snake from the table to his bunk, and began to smoke. Tom Platt followed his example; Uncle Salters, with Penn, fought his way up the ladder to stand his watch, and the cook set for the &#147;second half.&#148;
It came out of its bunks as the others had entered theirs, with a shake and a yawn. It ate till it could eat no more; and then Manuel filled his pipe with some terrible tobacco, crotched himself between the pawl-post and a forward bunk, cocked his feet up on the table, and smiled tender and indolent smiles at the smoke. Dan lay at length in his bunk, wrestling with a gaudy, gilt-stopped accordion, whose tunes went up and down with the pitching of the &#147;We&#146;re Here&#148;. The cook, his shoulders against the locker where he kept the fried pies (Dan was fond of fried pies), peeled potatoes, with one eye on the stove in event of too much water finding its way down the pipe; and the general smell and smother were past all description.
Harvey considered affairs, wondered that he was not deathly sick, and crawled into his bunk again, as the softest and safest place, while Dan struck up, &#147;I don&#146;t want to play in your yard,&#148; as accurately as the wild jerks allowed.
&#147;How long is this for?&#148; Harvey asked of Manuel.
&#147;Till she get a little quiet, and we can row to trawl. Perhaps to-night. Perhaps two days more. You do not like? Eh, wha-at?&#148;
&#147;I should have been crazy sick a week ago, but it doesn&#146;t seem to upset me now&#151;much.&#148;
&#147;That is because we make you fisherman, these days. If I was you, when I come to Gloucester I would give two, three big candles for my good luck.&#148;
&#147;Give who?&#148;
&#147;To be sure&#151;the Virgin of our Church on the Hill. She is very good to fishermen all the time. That is why so few of us Portugee men ever are drowned.&#148;
&#147;You&#146;re a Roman Catholic, then?&#148;
&#147;I am a Madeira man. I am not a Porto Pico boy. Shall I be Baptist, then? Eh, wha-at? I always give candles&#151;two, three more when I come to Gloucester. The good Virgin she never forgets me, Manuel.&#148;
&#147;I don&#146;t sense it that way,&#148; Tom Platt put in from his bunk, his scarred face lit up by the glare of a match as he sucked at his pipe. &#147;It stands to reason the sea&#146;s the sea; and you&#146;ll git jest about what&#146;s goin&#146;, candles or kerosene, fer that matter.&#148;
&#147;&#146;Tis a mighty good thing,&#148; said Long Jack, &#147;to have a fri&#146;nd at coort, though. I&#146;m o&#146; Manuel&#146;s way o&#146; thinkin&#146;. About tin years back I was crew to a Sou&#146; Boston market-boat. We was off Minot&#146;s Ledge wid a northeaster, butt first, atop of us, thicker&#146;n burgoo. The ould man was dhrunk, his chin waggin&#146; on the tiller, an&#146; I sez to myself, &#145;If iver I stick my boat-huk into T-wharf again, I&#146;ll show the saints fwhat manner o&#146; craft they saved me out av.&#146; Now, I&#146;m here, as ye can well see, an&#146; the model of the dhirty ould Kathleen, that took me a month to make, I gave ut to the priest, an&#146; he hung Ut up forninst the altar. There&#146;s more sense in givin&#146; a model that&#146;s by way o&#146; bein&#146; a work av art than any candle. Ye can buy candles at store, but a model shows the good saints ye&#146;ve tuk trouble an&#146; are grateful.&#148;
&#147;D&#146;you believe that, Irish?&#148; said Tom Platt, turning on his elbow.
&#147;Would I do Ut if I did not, Ohio?&#148;
&#147;Wa-al, Enoch Fuller he made a model o&#146; the old Ohio, and she&#146;s to Salem museum now. Mighty pretty model, too, but I guess Enoch he never done it fer no sacrifice; an&#146; the way I take it is&#151;&#148;
There were the makings of an hour-long discussion of the kind that fishermen love, where the talk runs in shouting circles and no one proves anything at the end, had not Dan struck up this cheerful rhyme:
