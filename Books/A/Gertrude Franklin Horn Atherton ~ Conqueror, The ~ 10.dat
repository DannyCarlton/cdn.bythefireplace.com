Rachael was riding home one afternoon from Basseterre, where she had  been purchasing summer lawns and cambrics. It was March, and the winter  sun had begun to use its summer fuel; but the trades blew softly, and  there was much shade on the road above the sea. There was one long  stretch, however, where not a tree grew, and Rachael drew rein for a  moment before leaving the avenue of tamarinds which had rustled above  her head for a mile or more. Although it was a hot scene that lay before  her, it was that which, when away from home, for some reason best known  to her memory, had always been first to rise. The wide pale-gray road  rose gradually for a long distance, dipped, and rose again. On either  side were cane-fields, their tender greens sharp against the deep hard  blue of the sea on the left, rising to cocoanut groves and the dark  heights of the mountains above the road. Far away, close to the sea, was  Brimstone Hill, that huge isolated rock so near in shape to the crater  of Mount Misery. Its fortifications showed their teeth against the faded  sky, and St. Christopher slept easily while tentative conquerors  approached, looked hard at this Gibraltar of the West Indies, and sailed  away.    
But there scarcely was a sail on the sea to-day. Its blue rose and fell,  in that vast unbroken harmony which quickens the West Indian at times  into an intolerable sense of his isolation. Rachael recalled how she had  stared at it in childish resentment, wondering if a mainland really lay  beyond, if Europe were a myth. She did not care if she never set foot on  a ship again, and her ambitions were in the grave with her desire for a  wealthy and intellectual husband.    
On the long road, rising gray and hot between the bright green  cane-fields, horsemen approached, and a number of slave women moved  slowly: women with erect rigid backs balancing large baskets or stacks  of cane on their heads, the body below the waist revolving with a  pivotal motion which suggests an anatomy peculiar to the tropics. They  had a dash of red about them somewhere, and their turbans were white.  Rachael's imagination never gave her St. Kitts without its slave women,  the "pic'nees" clinging to their hips as they bore their burdens on the  road or bent over the stones in the river. They belonged to its  landscape, with the palms and the cane-fields, the hot gray roads, and  the great jewel of the sea.    
Rachael left the avenue and rode onward. One of the horsemen took off  his Spanish sombrero and waved it. She recognized Dr. Hamilton and shook  her whip at him. He and his companion spurred their horses, and a moment  later Rachael and James Hamilton had met.    
"An unexpected pleasure for me, this sudden descent of my young  kinsman," said the doctor, "but a great one, for he brings me news of  all in Scotland, and he saw Will the day before he sailed."    
"It is too hot to stand here talking," said Rachael. "Come home with me  to a glass of Spanish port, and cake perhaps."    
The doctor was on his way to a consultation, but he ordered his relative  to go and pay his respects to Mistress Fawcett, and rode on whistling.  The two he had recklessly left to their own devices exchanged  platitudes, and covertly examined each other with quick admiration.    
There are dark Scots, and Hamilton was one of them. Although tall and  slight, he was knit with a close and peculiar elegance, which made him  look his best on a horse and in white linen. His face was burnt to the  hue of brick-dust by the first quick assault of the tropic sun, but it  was a thin face, well shaped, in spite of prominent cheek bones, and set  with the features of long breeding; and it was mobile, fiery, impetuous,  and very intelligent: ancestral coarseness had been polished fine long  since.    
They left the road and mounted toward the dark avenue of the Fawcett  estate, Rachael wondering if her mother would be irritated at the  informality of the stranger's first call; he should have arrived in  state with Dr. Hamilton at the hour of five. Perhaps it was to postpone  the moment of explanation that she permitted her horse to walk, even  after they had reached the level of the avenue, and finally to crop the  grass while she and Hamilton dismounted and sat down in a heavy grove of  tamarinds on the slope of the hill.    
"I'm just twenty-one and have my own way to make," he was telling her.  "There are three before me, so I couldn't afford the army, and as I've a  fancy for foreign lands, I've come out here to be a merchant. I have so  many kinsmen in this part of the world, and they've all succeeded so  well, I thought they'd be able to advise me how best to turn over the  few guineas I have. My cousin, the doctor, has taken me in hand, and if  I have any business capacity I shall soon find it out. But I ached for  the army, and failing that, I'd have liked being a scholar--as I know  you are, by your eyes."    
His Scotch accent was not unlike that of the West Indians, particularly  of the Barbadians; but his voice, although it retained the huskiness of  the wet North, had, somewhere in its depths, a peculiar metallic quality  which startled Rachael every time it rang out, and was the last of all  memories to linger, when memories were crumbling in a brain that could  stand no more.    
How it happened, Rachael spent the saner hours of the morrow attempting  to explain, but they sat under the tamarinds until the sun went down,  and Nevis began to robe for the night. Once they paused in their  desultory talk and listened to the lovely chorus of a West Indian  evening, that low incessant ringing of a million tiny bells. The bells  hung in the throats of nothing more picturesque than grasshoppers,  serpents, lizards, and frogs so small as to be almost invisible, but  they rang with a harmony that the inherited practice of centuries had  given them. And beyond was the monotonous accompaniment of the sea on  the rocks. Hamilton lived to be an old man, and he never left the West  Indies; but sometimes, at long and longer intervals, he found himself  listening to that Lilliputian orchestra, his attention attracted to it,  possibly, by a stranger; and then he remembered this night, and the  woman for whom he would have sacrificed earth and immortality had he  been lord of them.    
Heaven knows what they talked about. While it was light they stared out  at the blue sea or down on the rippling cane-fields, not daring to  exchange more than a casual and hasty glance. Both knew that they should  have separated the moment they met, but neither had the impulse nor the  intention to leave the shade of the wood; and when the brief twilight  fell and the moon rose, there still was Nevis, and after her the many  craft to divert their gaze. Hamilton was honourable and shy, and Rachael  was a woman of uncommon strength of character and had been brought up by  a woman of austere virtue. These causes held them apart for a time, but  one might as well have attempted to block two comets rushing at each  other in the same orbit. The magnetism of the Inevitable embraced them  and knit their inner selves together, even while they sat decorously  apart. Rachael had taken off her hat at once, and even after it grew  dark in their arbour, Hamilton fancied he could see the gleam of her  hair. Her eyes were startled and brilliant, and her nostrils quivered  uneasily, but she defined none of the sensations that possessed her but  the overwhelming recrudescence of her youth. It had seemed to her that  it flamed from its ashes before Dr. Hamilton finished his formal words  of introduction, and all its forgotten hopes and impulses, timidity and  vagueness, surged through her brain during those hours beside the  stranger, submerging the memory of Levine. Indeed, she felt even younger  than before maturity so suddenly had been thrust upon her; for in those  old days she had been almost as severely intellectual as yesterday, and  when she had dreamed of the future, it had been with the soberness of an  overtaxed brain. But to-day even the world seemed young again. She  fancied she could hear the unquiet pulses of the Island, so long grown  old, and Nevis had never looked so fair. She hardly was conscious of her  womanhood, only of that possessing sense of happiness in youth. As for  Hamilton, he had never felt otherwise than young, although he was a  college-bred man, something of a scholar, and he had seen more or less  of the world since his boyhood. But the intensity and ardour of his  nature had received no check, neither were they halfway on their  course; and he had never loved. It had seemed to him that the Island  opened and a witch came out, and in those confused hours he hardly knew  whether she were good or bad, his ideal woman or his ideal devil; but he  loved her. He was as pale as his sunburn would permit him to be, and his  hands were clasped tightly about his knees, when relief came in the  shape of Mary Fawcett.    
Her daughter's horse had gone home and taken the stranger with him, and  Mistress Fawcett, with quick suspicion, new as it was, started at once  down the avenue. Rachael heard the familiar tapping of her mother's  stick, hastily adjusted her hat, and managed to reach the road with  Hamilton before her mother turned its bend.    
Mary Fawcett understood and shivered with terror. She was far from being  her imperious self as her daughter presented the stranger and remarked  that he was a cousin of Dr. Hamilton, characteristically refraining from  apology or explanation.    
"Well," she said, "the doctor will doubtless bring you to call some day.  I will send your horse to you. Say good evening to the stranger,  Rachael, and come home." She was one of the most hospitable women in the  Caribbees, and this was the kinsman of her best friend, but she longed  for power to exile him out of St. Kitts that night.    
Hamilton lifted his hat, and Rachael followed her mother. She was cold  and frightened, and Levine's white malignant face circled about her.    
Her mother requested her support, and she almost carried the light  figure to the house. Mistress Fawcett sent a slave after Hamilton's  horse, then went to her room and wrote a note to Dr. Hamilton, asking  him to call on the following day and to come alone. The two women did  not meet again that night.    
But there is little privacy in the houses of St. Kitts and Nevis. Either  the upper part of almost every room is built of ornamental lattice-work,  or the walls are set with numerous jalousies, that can be closed when a  draught is undesirable but conduct the slightest sound. Rachael's room  adjoined her mother's. She knew that the older woman was as uneasily  awake as herself, though from vastly different manifestations of the  same cause. At four o'clock, when the guinea fowl were screeching like  demons, and had awakened the roosters and the dogs to swell the infernal  chorus of a West Indian morning, Rachael sat up in bed and laughed  noiselessly.    
"What a night!" she thought. "And for what? A man who companioned me for  four hours as no other man had ever done? and who made me feel as if the  world had turned to fire and light? It may have been but a mood of my  own, it is so long since I have talked with a man near to my own  age--and he is so near!--and yet so real a man.... No one could call him  handsome, for he looks like a flayed Carib, and I have met some of the  handsomest men in Europe and not given them a thought. Yet this man kept  me beside him for four hours, and has me awake a whole night because he  is not with me. Has the discipline of these last years, then, gone for  nothing? Am I but an excitable West Indian after all, and shall I have  corded hands before I am twenty-five? It was a mistake to shut myself  away from danger. Had I been constantly meeting the young men of the  Island and all strangers who have come here during the last two years, I  should not be wild for this one--even if he has something in him unlike  other men--and lie awake all night like the silly women who dream  everlastingly of the lover to come. I am a fool."    
She lit her candle and went into her mother's room. Mary Fawcett was  sitting up in bed, her white hair hanging out of her nightcap. It seemed  to her that the end of the world had come, and she cursed human nature  and the governors of the Island.    
"I know what has kept you awake," said Rachael, "but do not fear. It was  but a passing madness--God smite those guinea fowl! I have lived the  life of a nun, and it is an unnatural life for a young woman. Yesterday  I learned that I have not the temperament of the scholar, the  recluse--that is all. I should have guessed it sooner--then I should not  have been fascinated by this brilliant Scot. It was my mind that flew  eagerly to companionship--that was all. The hours were pleasant. I would  not regret them but for the deep uneasiness they have caused you. To-day  I shall enter the world again. There are many clever and accomplished  young men on St. Kitts. I will meet and talk to them all. We will  entertain them here. There is a ball at Government House to-night,  another at Mistress Irwin's on Wednesday week. I promise you that I will  be as gay and as universal as a girl in her first season, and this man  shall see no more of me than any other man."    
Her mother watched her keenly as she delivered her long tirade. Her face  was deeply flushed. The arm that held the candle was tense, and her hair  fell about her splendid form like a cloud of light. Had Hamilton seen  anything so fair in Europe? What part would he play in this scheme of  catholicity?    
"You will meet this man if you go abroad," she replied. "Better stay  here and forbid him the gates."    
"And think about him till I leap on my horse and ride to meet him? A  fevered imagination will make a god of a Tom Noddy. If I see him  daily--with others--he will seem as commonplace as all men."    
Mary Fawcett did not speak for some moments. Then she said: "Hark ye,  Rachael. I interfered once and brought such damnable misery upon you  that I dare not--almost--(she remembered her note to Dr. Hamilton)  interfere again. This time you shall use your own judgement, something  you have taught me to respect. Whatever the result, I will be to the end  what I always have been, the best friend you have. You are very strong.  You have had an awful experience, and it has made a woman of thirty of  you. You are no silly little fool, rushing blindly into the arms of the  first man whose eyes are black enough. You have been brought up to look  upon light women with horror. In your darkest days you never sought to  console yourself as weaker women do. Therefore, in spite of what I saw  in both your faces yesterday, I hope."    
"Yes--and give yourself no more uneasiness. Could <i>I</i> look upon the  love of man with favour? Not unless I were to be born again, and my  memory as dead as my body."    
"If you love, you will be born again; and if this man overmasters your  imagination, your memory might quite as well be dead. One of the three  or four things in my life that I have to be thankful for is that I never  had to pass through that ordeal. You are far dearer to me than I ever  was to myself, and if you are called upon to go through that wretched  experience, whose consequences never finish, and I with so little time  left in which to stand by and protect you--" She changed abruptly.  "Promise me that you will do nothing unconsidered, that you will not  behave like the ordinary Francesca--for whom I have always had the most  unmitigated contempt. The hour. The man. The fall. The wail: 'The earth  rocked, the stars fell. I knew not what I did!' You have deliberation  and judgement. Use them now--and do not ramble alone in the gorge with  this handsome Scot--for he is a fine man; I would I could deny it. I  felt his charm, although he did not open his mouth."    
Rachael's eyes flashed. "Ah! did you?" she cried. "Well, but what of  that? Are not our creoles a handsome race, and have not all but a few  been educated in England? Yes, I will promise you--if you think all this  is serious enough to require a promise."    
"But you care so little for the world. You would be sacrificing so much  less than other women--nevertheless it would make you wretched and  humiliate just as much; do not forget that. I almost am tempted to wish  that you had a lighter nature--that you would flirt with love and brush  it away, while the world was merely amused at a suspected gallantry. But  <i>you</i>--you would love for a lifetime, and you would end by living with  him openly. There is no compromise in you."    
"Surely we have become more serious than an afternoon's talk with an  interesting stranger should warrant. I am full of a sudden longing for  the world, and who knows but I shall become so wedded to it that I would  yield it for no man? Besides, do I not live to make you happy, to  reward as best I can your unselfish devotion? If ever I could love any  man more than I love you, then that love would be overwhelming indeed.  But although I can imagine myself forgetting the world in such a love, I  cannot picture you on the sacrificial altar."
