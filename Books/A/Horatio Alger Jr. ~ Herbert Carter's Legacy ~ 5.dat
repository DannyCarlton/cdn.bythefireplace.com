  Apparently the deceased had but few relatives. But six persons were  in  a small room appropriated to the mourners when our hero and his new   acquaintance entered. One of these, and far the most imposing in   appearance, was a stout lady, who quite filled up the only armchair in   the room. In a plain chair close by was a meek little man, three   inches shorter, and probably not more than half her weight. A boy and   girl, the children of the ill-matched pair, the former resembling the   father, the latter the mother, were ranged alongside. Permit me to   introduce Mr. and Mrs. Josiah Pinkerton, of Castleton, an adjoining   town. Master Albert and Miss Nancy Pinkerton. 
  Mrs. Pinkerton is a milliner, and her husband is her clerk and  errand  boy. She has considerable business capacity, and makes enough  to  support the family comfortably, besides adding something annually  to  the fund in the savings bank. The relationship to the deceased is  on  the side of the husband, who is a cousin. This relationship has  given  rise to great expectations on the part of Mrs. Pinkerton, who  fully  expects to inherit half the estate of Mr. Carter. 
  &#8220;If we get it, Josiah,&#8221; she has promised magnificently, &#8220;I'll buy  you  a new suit of clothes.&#8221; 
  &#8220;But, Maria,&#8221; expostulated the meek husband, &#8220;it will be left to  me,  not to you.&#8221; 
  &#8220;Why so?&#8221; demanded she, frowning. 
  &#8220;Because he is my cousin, not yours.&#8221; 
  &#8220;You indeed!&#8221; retorted the wife, angrily; &#8220;and what do you know  about  the use of money? Who supports the family, I should like to  know?&#8221; 
  &#8220;I help,&#8221; answered Josiah, meekly. 
  &#8220;And precious little you help,&#8221; returned his wife, sarcastically.  &#8220;So  far as you are concerned, we should all be in the poor house long   before this. No, Josiah, the money must come into my hands. I'll give   you a good allowance, and hire an errand boy so that you needn't have   to carry round bundles. You ought to be contented with that.&#8221; 
  As no legacy had yet been received, Mr. Pinkerton thought it best  not  to continue the discussion. Indeed, he was rather afraid of his   imperious wife, who held the reins of authority, and whom he did not   dare to dispute. 
  The two other relations were, first, a brown-faced and brown-handed   farmer, Alonzo Granger, and an old lady, of seventy or thereabouts&#8212;   Miss Nancy Carter, a sister of the deceased. For years she had lived   on a small pension from her brother, increased somewhat by knitting   stockings for the neighbors. She, indeed, was the only real mourner.   The rest were speculating about how far they were likely to be   benefited by the death of the deceased, of whom they had seen but   little in life. Even Herbert, though impressed by the presence of   death, could hardly be expected to feel deep grief for a man who had   neglected his mother in his life. 
  Of the funeral rites it is unnecessary to speak. We are interested  in  what came afterwards. 
  The relations were quietly notified to meet at five o'clock in the   office of Mr. Spencer, the lawyer, to whom had been intrusted the will   of the late Mr. Carter. Those who have even a slight knowledge of   human nature will not need to be told that the attendance of all was   punctual. There was an anxious, expectant look on the faces of all&#8212;   not even excepting the old lady. She knew that if her brother had made   no provision for her, she must go to the alms-house, and against this   her honest pride revolted. She was willing to live on anything,   however little, if she might live independently, as she had hitherto   done. To feel herself dependent on public charity would indeed have   been a hard trial for the poor old lady. Of all, probably Mrs.   Pinkerton was the most confident. She had come to feel that her family   was entitled to a large share of the estate, and she had gone so far   as to decide just how she would invest it, and what new arrangements   she would make, for she had no idea of consulting her husband on the   subject. 
  The lawyer was a gentlemanly-looking man, whose face inspired   confidence in his integrity&#8212;a remark which, unhappily, cannot be made   of all in his profession. He took his seat at a table, and produced   the will, which he considerately commenced reading at once. After the   usual introduction, the will proceeded thus: 
  &#8220;To my sister Nancy I give the use of my house, rent free, as long  as  she shall live. I leave her also an income of two hundred dollars a   year, which, as her wants are small, will be sufficient to maintain   her in comfort.&#8221; 
  The old lady breathed a sigh of relief. Her fears were removed. She   could continue to live as she had been accustomed to do, and need not   be beholden to private or public charity. Mrs. Pinkerton was not so   well pleased. She felt almost as if she had been deprived of what   belonged to her by right. She frowned at Miss Nancy, but the old lady   was unconscious of the displeasure excited in the bosom of her   imposing-looking relative. 
  The lawyer proceeded: &#8220;To my cousin, Alonzo Granger, I leave one   hundred dollars; not because he needs it, for I understand that he is   well-to-do, but as a mark of remembrance.&#8221; 
  The farmer scowled slightly, and opened and closed his brown hands  in  dissatisfaction. He was well-to-do; but when was a man ever  satisfied  with that? He had counted upon a few thousands, with which  he proposed  to buy an adjoining farm. Mrs. Pinkerton, however, was  pleased. There  was so much the more for her. 
  &#8220;To Cornelius Dixon&#8221;&#8212;here Herbert's morning acquaintance began to   feel excited&#8212;&#8220;I bequeath one hundred dollars, to buy a looking-glass   and a new suit of clothes.&#8221; 
  The young man's face lengthened very perceptibly as he heard the  small  amount of his legacy, and he glared savagely at Mrs. Pinkerton,  who  showed a mirthful face at his discomfiture. 
  Her turn came next. 
  &#8220;To Josiah Pinkerton, his wife and children, I leave one hundred   dollars apiece; also my best black pantaloons, which he or his wife   may appropriate, as may be arranged between them.&#8221; 
  All except the Pinkertons laughed at this sly hit, and even the  lawyer  smiled; but the stout lady flushed with rage and  disappointment, and  ejaculated: &#8220;Abominable!&#8221; The eyes of all were now  directed to  Herbert, who was the only one remaining. Could it be  possible that the  balance of the property was left to him? The fear of  this made him the  focus of unfriendly eyes, and he became restive and  anxious. 
  &#8220;To my namesake, Herbert Carter, I leave a black trunk which I keep  in  my room, with all that it contains. To his mother I direct that the   sum of one hundred dollars be paid.&#8221; 
  This was not much, but it was more than Herbert had expected. He  knew  how welcome even one hundred dollars would be to his mother, and  he  looked satisfied&#8212;the only one of the party, except the old lady,  who  showed any pleasure at the contents of the will. 
  The relatives looked bewildered. All had been mentioned in turn,  and  yet but a small part&#8212;a very small part&#8212;of the estate had been   disposed of. Mrs. Pinkerton bluntly expressed the general curiosity. 
  &#8220;Who's to have the rest, Mr. Spencer? &#8220;she demanded. 
  &#8220;I'm coming to that,&#8221; answered the lawyer, quietly. 
  &#8220;All the rest and residue of my property, of whatever kind, I leave  to  the town of Randolph, to establish a high school, directing that  not  more than twenty thousand dollars be expended upon the building,  which  shall be of brick. I desire that the school shall be known as  the  Carter School, to the end that my name may be remembered in  connection  with what I hope will prove a public blessing.&#8221; &#8220;That is  all,&#8221; said  the lawyer, and he laid down the will upon the table.
