The voyage across the Atlantic was long and uneventful. No whales,  no icebergs, no excitement of any sort. My fellow-passengers said  it was as dull as it was calm. But as for me, I had plenty to occupy  my mind meanwhile. Strange things had happened in the interval, and  were happening to me on the way. Strange things, in part, of my own  internal history.    
For before I left England, as I sat with Aunt Emma in her little  drawing-room at Barton-on-the-Sea, discussing my plans and devising  routes westward, she made me, quite suddenly, an unexpected  confession.    
"Una," she said, after a long pause, "you haven't told me, my dear,  why you're going to Canada. And I don't want to ask you. I know  pretty well. We needn't touch upon that. You're going to hunt up  some supposed clue to the murderer."    
"Perhaps so, Auntie," I said oracularly: "and perhaps not."    
For I didn't want it to get talked about and be put into all the  newspapers. And I knew now if I wanted to keep it out, I must first  be silent.    
Aunt Emma drew nearer and took my hand in hers. At the same time,  she held up the other scarred and lacerated palm.    
"Do you know when I got that, Una?" she asked with a sudden burst.  "Well, I'll tell you, my child.... It was the night of your father's  death. And I got it climbing over the wall at The Grange, to escape  detection."    
My blood ran cold once more. What on earth could this mean? Had  Auntie--? But no. I had the evidence of my own senses that it was  Courtenay Ivor. I'd tracked him down now. There was no room for  doubt. The man on the wagon was the man who fired the shot. I could  have sworn to that bent back, of my own knowledge, among a thousand.    
I hadn't long to wait, however. Auntie went on after a short pause.    
"I was there," she said, "by accident, trying for once to see you."    
I looked at her fixedly still, and still I said nothing.    
"I was stopping with friends at the time, ten miles off from  Woodbury," Aunt Emma went on, smoothing my hand with hers, "and I  longed so to see you. I came over by train that day, and stopped  late about the town in hopes I might meet you in the street. But I  was disappointed. Towards evening I ventured even to go into the  grounds of The Grange, and look about everywhere on the chance that  I might see you. Perhaps your father might be out. I went round  towards the window, which I now know to be the library. As I went, I  saw a bicycle leaning up against the wall by the window. I thought  that must be some visitor, but still I went on. But just as I  reached the window, I saw a flash of electric light; and by the  light, I could make out your father's head and beard. He looked as  if he were talking angrily and loudly to somebody. The window was  open. I was afraid to stop longer. In a sudden access of fear, I ran  across the shrubbery towards the garden-wall. To tell you the truth,  I was horribly frightened. Why, I don't know; for nothing had  happened as yet. I suppose it was just the dusk and the mean sense  of intrusion."    
She paused and wiped her brow. I sat still, and listened eagerly.    
"Presently," she went on, very low, "as I ran and ran, I heard  behind me a loud crash--a sound as of a pistol-shot. That terrified  me still more. I thought I was being pursued. Perhaps they took me  for a burglar. In the agony of my terror, I rushed at the wall in  mad haste, and climbed over it anyhow. In climbing, I tore my hand,  as you see, and made myself bleed, oh, terribly! However, I  persevered, and got down on the other side, with my clothes very  little the worse for the scramble. And, fortunately, I was carrying  a small light dust-cloak: I put it on at once, and it covered up  everything. Then I began to walk along the road as fast as I could  in the direction of the station. As I did so, a bicycle shot out  from the gate in the opposite direction, going as hard as it could  spin, simply flying towards Whittingham. Three minutes later, a man  came up to me, breathless. It was the gardener at The Grange, I  believe.    
"'Have you seen anybody go this way?' he asked. 'A young man,  running hard? A young man in knickerbockers?'    
"'N--no,' I answered, trembling; for I was afraid to confess. 'Not a  soul has gone past!'    
"Of course, I didn't know of the murder as yet; and I only wanted to  get off unperceived to the station.    
"I'd bound up my hand in my handkerchief by that time, and held it  tight under my cloak. I went back by train unnoticed, and returned  to my friends' house. I hadn't even told them I was going to  Woodbury at all. I pretended I'd been spending the day at  Whittingham. Next morning, I read in the paper of your father's  murder."    
I stared hard at Aunt Emma.    
"Why didn't you tell me this long ago?" I cried, in an agony of  suspense. "Why didn't you give evidence and say so at the inquest?"    
"How could I?" Aunt Emma answered, looking back at me appealingly.  "The circumstances were too suspicious. As it was, everybody was  running after the young man in knickerbockers. Nobody took any  notice of a little old lady in a long grey dust-cloak. But if once  I'd confessed and shown my wounded hand, who would ever have  believed I'd nothing to do with the murder?--except you, perhaps,  Una. Oh no: I came back here to my own home as fast as ever I could;  for I was really ill. I took to my bed at once. And as nobody called  me to give evidence at the inquest, I said nothing to anybody."    
"But the bicycle!" I cried. "The bicycle! You ought to have  mentioned that. You were the only one who saw it. It was a clue to  the murderer."    
"If I'd told," Aunt Emma answered, "I should never have been allowed  to take charge of you at all. I thought my one clear duty was to my  sister's child: it was to take care of your health in your shattered  condition. And even now, Una, I tell you only for this: if you find  out anything new, in Canada or here, try not to drag me into it. I  couldn't stand the strain. Cross-examination would kill me."    
"I'll remember it, auntie," I said, wearied out with excitement.  "But I think you did wrong, all the same. In a case like this, it's  everybody's first duty to tell all he knows, in the interests of  justice."    
However, this confession of Aunt Emma's rendered one thing more  certain to me than ever before. I was sure I was on the right track  now, after Courtenay Ivor. The bicycle clinched the proof.    
But I said nothing as yet to the police, or to my friendly  Inspector. I was determined to hunt the whole thing up on my own  account first, and then deliver my criminal, when fully secured, to  the laws of my country.    
Not that I was vindictive. Not that I wanted to punish the man. No;  I shrank terribly from the task. But to relieve myself from this  persistent sense of surrounding mystery, and to free others from  suspicion, I felt compelled to discover him. It seemed to me like a  duty laid upon me from without. I dared not shirk it.    
On the way out to Quebec, the sea seemed to revive strange memories.  I had never crossed it before, except long, long ago, on my way home  from Australia. And now that I sat on deck, in a wicker-chair, and  looked at the deep dark waves by myself, I began once more, in vague  snatches, to recall that earlier voyage. It came back to me all of  itself. And that was quite in keeping with my previous recollections.  My past life, I felt sure, was unfolding itself slowly to me in  regular succession, from childhood onward.    
Sitting there on the quarter-deck, gazing hard at the waves, I  remembered how I had played on a similar ship years and years  before, a little girl in short frocks, with my mamma in a long  folding-chair beside me. I could see my mamma, with a sort of  frightened smile on her poor pale face; and she looked so unhappy.  My papa was there too, somewhat older and greyer--very unlike the  papa of my first Australian picture. His face was so much hairier.  Mamma cried a good deal at times, and papa tried to comfort her.  Besides, what struck me most, there was no more baby. I wasn't even  allowed to speak about baby. That subject was tabooed--perhaps  because it always made mamma cry so much, and press me hard to her  bosom. At any rate, I remembered how once I spoke of baby to some  fellow-passenger in the saloon, and papa was very angry, and caught  me up in his arms and took me down to my berth; and there I had to  stop all day by myself (though it was rolling hard) and could have  no fruit for dinner, because I'd been naughty. I was strictly  enjoined never to mention baby to anyone again, either then or at  any time. I was to forget all about her.    
Day after day, as we sailed on, reminiscences of the same sort  crowded thicker and thicker upon me. Never reminiscences of my later  life, but always early scenes brought up by distinct suggestion  of that Australian voyage. When we passed a ship, it burst upon me  how we'd passed such ships before: when there was fire-drill on  deck, I remembered having assisted years earlier at just such  fire-drill. The whole past came back like a dream, so that I could  reconstruct now the first five or six years of my life almost  entirely. And yet, even so there was a gap, a puzzle, a difficulty  somehow. I couldn't make the chronology of this slow-returning  memory fit in as it ought with the chronology of the facts given to  me by Aunt Emma and the Moores of Torquay. There was a constant  discrepancy. It seemed to me that I must be a year or two older at  least than they made me out. I remembered the voyage home far too  well for my age. I fancied I went back further in my Australian  recollections than would be possible from the dates Aunt Emma  assigned me.    
Slowly, as I compared these mental pictures of my first childhood  one with the other, a strange fact seemed to loom forth,  incomprehensible, incredible. When first it struck me, all unnerved  as I was, my reason staggered before it. But it was true, none the  less: quite true, I felt certain. Had I had two papas, then?--for  the pictures differed so. Was one, clean-shaven, trim, and in a  linen coat, the same as the other, older, graver, and sterner, with  much hair on his face, and a rough sort of look, whom I saw more  persistently in my later childish memories? I could hardly believe  it. One man couldn't alter so greatly in a few short years. Yet I  thought of them both alike quite unquestioningly as papa: I thought  of them too, I fancied, in a dim sort of way, as one and the same  person.    
These fresh mysteries occupied my mind for the greater part of that  uneventful voyage. To throw them off, I laughed and talked as much  as possible with the rest of the passengers. Indeed, I gained the  reputation of being "an awfully jolly girl," so heartily did I throw  myself into all the games and amusements, to escape from the burden  of my pressing thoughts: and I believe many old ladies on board were  thoroughly scandalised that a woman whose father had been brutally  murdered should ever be able to seem so bright and lively again. How  little they knew! And what a world of mystery seemed to oppress and  surround me!    
At last, early one morning, we reached the Gulf, and took in our  pilot off the Straits of Belleisle. I was on deck at the time,  playing a game called "Shovelboard." As the pilot reached the ship,  he took the captain's hand, and, to my immense surprise, said in an  audible voice:    
"So you've the famous Miss Callingham for a passenger, I hear, this  voyage. There's the latest Quebec papers. You'll see you're looked  for. Our people are expecting her."    
I rushed forward, fiery hot, and with a trembling hand took one of  the papers he was distributing all round, right and left, to the  people on deck. It was unendurable that the memory of that one event  should thus dog me through life with such ubiquitous persistence. I  tore open the sheet. There, with horrified eyes, I read this hateful  paragraph, in the atrociously vulgar style of Transatlantic  journalism:    
"The Sarmatian, expected off Belleisle to-morrow morning, brings  among her passengers, as we learn by telegram, the famous Una  Callingham, whose connection with the so-called Woodbury Mystery is  now a matter of historical interest. The mysterious two-souled lady  possesses, at present, all her faculties intact, as before the  murder, and is indeed, people say, a remarkably spry and intelligent  young person; but she has most conveniently forgotten all the events  of her past life, and more particularly the circumstances of her  father's death, which is commonly conjectured to have been due to  the pistol of some unknown lover. Such freaks of memory are common,  we all know, in the matter of small debts and of newspaper  subscriptions, but they seldom extend quite so far as the violent  death of a near relation. However, Una knows her own business best.  The Sarmatian is due alongside the Bonsecours Quay at 10 a.m. on  Wednesday, the 10th; and all Quebec will, no doubt, be assembled at  the landing-stage to say 'Good-morning' to the two-souled lady."    
The paper dropped from my hand. This was too horrible for anything!  How I was ever to go through the ordeal of the landing at Quebec  after that, I hadn't the faintest conception. And was I to be dogged  and annoyed like this through all my Canadian trip by anonymous  scribblers? Had these people no hearts? no consideration for the  sensitiveness of an English lady?    
I looked over the side of the ship at the dark-blue water. Oh, how  I longed to plunge into it and be released for ever from this  abiding nightmare!
