In putting before the public the last work by Mr. Grant Allen, the  publishers desire to express their deep regret at the author's  unexpected and lamented death--a regret in which they are sure to  be joined by the many thousand readers whom he did so much to  entertain. A man of curiously varied and comprehensive knowledge,  and with the most charming personality; a writer who, treating of a  wide variety of subjects, touched nothing which he did not make  distinctive, he filled a place which no man living can exactly  occupy. The last chapter of this volume had been roughly sketched  by Mr. Allen before his final illness, and his anxiety, when  debarred from work, to see it finished, was relieved by the  considerate kindness of his friend and neighbour, Dr. Conan Doyle,  who, hearing of his trouble, talked it over with him, gathered his  ideas, and finally wrote it out for him in the form in which it now  appears--a beautiful and pathetic act of friendship which it is a  pleasure to record.
