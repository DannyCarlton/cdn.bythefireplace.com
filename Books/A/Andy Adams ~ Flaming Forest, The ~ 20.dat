  The shock of the amazing discovery which Carrigan had made was as   complete as it was unexpected. His eyes had looked upon the last   thing in the world he might have guessed at or anticipated when  they  beheld through the window of St. Pierre's cabin the beautiful  face and  partly disrobed figure of Carmin Fanchet. The first  effect of that  shock had been to drive him away. His action had  been involuntary,  almost without the benefit of reason, as if  Carmin had been Marie-Anne  herself receiving the caresses which  were rightfully hers, and upon  which it was both insult and  dishonor for him to spy. He realized now  that he had made a  mistake in leaving the window too quickly. 
  But he did not move back through the gloom, for there was   something too revolting in what he had seen, and with the  revulsion  of it a swift understanding of the truth which made his  hands clench  as he sat down on the edge of the raft with his feet  and legs  submerged in the slow-moving current of the river. The  thing was not  uncommon. It was the same monstrous story, as old as  the river itself,  but in this instance it filled him with a  sickening sort of horror  which gripped him at first even more than  the strangeness of the fact  that Carmin Fanchet was the other  woman. His vision and his soul were  reaching out to the bateau  lying in darkness on the far side of the  river, where St. Pierre's  wife was alone in her unhappiness. His first  impulse was to fling  himself in the river and race to her&#8212;his second,  to go back to  St. Pierre, even in his nakedness, and call him forth to  a  reckoning. In his profession of man-hunting he had never had the   misfortune to kill, but he could kill St. Pierre&#8212;now. His fingers   dug into the slippery wood of the log under him, his blood ran  hot,  and in his eyes blazed the fury of an animal as he stared  into the  wall of gloom between him and Marie-Anne Boulain. 
  How much did she know? That was the first question which pounded   in his brain. He suddenly recalled his reference to the fight, his   apology to Marie-Anne that it should happen so near to her  presence,  and he saw again the queer little twist of her mouth as  she let slip  the hint that she was not the only one of her sex who  would know of  tomorrow's fight. He had not noticed the  significance of it then. But  now it struck home. Marie-Anne was  surely aware of Carmin Fanchet's  presence on the raft. 
  But did she know more than that? Did she know the truth, or was   her heart filled only with suspicion and fear, aggravated by St.   Pierre's neglect and his too-apparent haste to return to the raft   that night? Again David's mind flashed back, recalling her defense  of  Carmin Fanchet when he had first told her his story of the  woman whose  brother he had brought to the hangman's justice. There  could be but  one conclusion. Marie-Anne knew Carmin Fanchet, and  she also knew she  was on the raft with St. Pierre. 
  As cooler judgment returned to him, Carrigan refused to concede   more than that. For any one of a dozen reasons Carmin Fanchet  might  be on the raft going down the river, and it was also quite  within  reason that Marie-Anne might have some apprehension of a  woman as  beautiful as Carmin, and possibly intuition had begun to  impinge upon  her a disturbing fear of a something that might  happen. But until  tonight he was confident she had fought against  this suspicion, and  had overridden it, even though she knew a  woman more beautiful than  herself was slowly drifting down the  stream with her husband. She had  betrayed no anxiety to him in the  days that had passed; she had waited  eagerly for St. Pierre; like  a bird she had gone to him when at last  he came, and he had seen  her crushed close in St. Pierre's arms in  their meeting. It was  this night, with its gloom and its storm, that  had made the  shadowings of her unrest a torturing reality. For St.  Pierre had  brought her back to the bateau and had played a pitiably  weak part  in concealing his desire to return to the raft. 
  So he told himself Marie-Anne did not know the truth, not as he   had seen it through the window of St. Pierre's cabin. She had been   hurt, for he had seen the sting of it, and in that same instant he   had seen her soul rise up and triumph. He saw again the sudden  fire  that came into her eyes when St. Pierre urged the necessity  of his  haste, he saw her slim body grow tense, her red lips curve  in a flash  of pride and disdain. And as Carrigan thought of her in  that way his  muscles grew tighter, and he cursed St. Pierre.  Marie-Anne might be  hurt, she might guess that her husband's eyes  and thoughts were too  frequently upon another's face&#8212;but in the  glory of her womanhood it  was impossible for her to conceive of a  crime such as he had witnessed  through the cabin window. Of that  he was sure. 
  And then, suddenly, like a blinding sheet of lightning out of a   dark sky, came back to him all that St. Pierre had said about   Marie-Anne. He had pitied St. Pierre then; he had pitied this  great  cool-eyed giant of a man who was fighting gloriously, he had  thought,  in the face of a situation that would have excited most  men. Frankly  St. Pierre had told him Marie-Anne cared more for him  than she should.  With equal frankness he had revealed his wife's  confessions to him,  that she knew of his love for her, of his kiss  upon her hair. 
  In the blackness Carrigan's face burned hot. If he had in him the   desire to kill St. Pierre now, might not St. Pierre have had an   equally just desire to kill him? For he had known, even as he  kissed  her hair, and as his arms held her close to his breast in  crossing the  creek, that she was the wife of St. Pierre. And  Marie-Anne&#8212; 
  His muscles relaxed. Slowly he lowered himself into the cool wash   of the river, and struck out toward the bateau. He did not breast  the  current with the same fierce determination with which he had  crossed  through the storm to the raft, but drifted with it and  reached the  opposite shore a quarter of a mile below the bateau.  Here he waited  for a time, while the thickness of the clouds  broke, and a gray light  came through them, revealing dimly the  narrow path of pebbly wash  along the shore. Silently, a stark  naked shadow in the night, he came  back to the bateau and crawled  through his window. 
  He lighted a lamp, and turned it very low, and in the dim glow of   it rubbed his muscles until they burned. He was fit for tomorrow,  and  the knowledge of that fitness filled him with a savage  elation. A  good-humored love of sport had induced him to fling his  first  half-bantering challenge into the face of Concombre Bateese,  but that  sentiment was gone. The approaching fight was no longer  an incident, a  foolish error into which he had unwittingly plunged  himself. In this  hour it was the biggest physical thing that had  ever loomed up in his  life, and he yearned for the dawn with the  eagerness of a beast that  waits for the kill which comes with the  break of day. But it was not  the half-breed's face he saw under  the hammering of his blows. He  could not hate the half-breed. He  could not even dislike him now. He  forced himself to bed, and  later he slept. In the dream that came to  him it was not Bateese  who faced him in battle, but St. Pierre  Boulain. 
  He awoke with that dream a thing of fire in his brain. The sun was   not yet up, but the flush of it was painting the east, and he  dressed  quietly and carefully, listening for some sound of  awakening beyond  the bulkhead. If Marie-Anne was awake, she was  very still. There was  noise ashore. Across the river he could hear  the singing of men, and  through his window saw the white smoke of  early fires rising above the  tree-tops. It was the Indian who  unlocked the door and brought in his  breakfast, and it was the  Indian who returned for the dishes half an  hour later. 
  After that Carrigan waited, tense with the desire for action to   begin. He sensed no premonition of evil about to befall him. Every   nerve and sinew in his body was alive for the combat. He thrilled   with an overwhelming confidence, a conviction of his ability to  win,  an almost dangerous, self-conviction of approaching triumph  in spite  of the odds in weight and brute strength which were  pitted against  him. A dozen times he listened at the bulkhead  between him and  Marie-Anne, and still he heard no movement on the  other side. 
  It was eight o'clock when one of the bateau men appeared at the   door and asked if he was ready. Quickly David joined him. He  forgot  his taunts to Concombre Bateese, forgot the softly padded  gloves in  his pack with which he had promised to pommel the half-  breed into  oblivion. He was thinking only of naked fists. 
  Into a canoe he followed the bateau man, who turned his craft   swiftly in the direction of the opposite shore. And as they went,   David was sure he caught the slight movement of a curtain at the   little window of Marie-Anne's forward cabin. He smiled back and   raised his hand, and at that the curtain was drawn back entirely,  and  he knew that St. Pierre's wife was watching him as he went to  the  fight. 
  The raft was deserted, but a little below it, on a wide strip of   beach made hard and smooth by flood water, had gathered a crowd of   men. It seemed odd to David they should remain so quiet, when he  knew  the natural instinct of the riverman was to voice his emotion  at the  top of his lungs. He spoke of this to the bateau man, who  shrugged his  shoulders and grinned. 
  &quot;Eet ees ze command of St. Pierre,&quot; he explained. &quot;St. Pierre say   no man make beeg noise at&#8212;what you call heem&#8212;funeral? An' theese   goin' to be wan gran' fun-e-RAL, m'sieu!&quot; 
  &quot;I see,&quot; David nodded. He did not grin back at the other's humor. 
  He was looking at the crowd. A giant figure had appeared out of   the center of it and was coming slowly down to the river. It was  St.  Pierre. Scarcely had the prow of the canoe touched shore when  David  leaped out and hurried to meet him. Behind St. Pierre came  Bateese,  the half-breed. He was stripped to the waist and naked  from the knees  down. His gorilla-like arms hung huge and loose at  his sides, and the  muscles of his hulking body stood out like  carven mahogany in the  glisten of the morning sun. He was like a  grizzly, a human beast of  monstrous power, something to look at,  to back away from, to fear. 
  Yet, David scarcely noticed him. He met St. Pierre, faced him, and   stopped&#8212;and he had gone swiftly to this meeting, so that the  chief  of the Boulains was within earshot of all his men. 
  St. Pierre was smiling. He held out his hand as he had held it out   once before in the bateau cabin, and his big voice boomed out a   greeting. 
  Carrigan did not answer, nor did he look at the extended hand. For   an instant the eyes of the two men met, and then, swift as  lightning,  Carrigan's arm shot out, and with the flat of his hand  he struck St.  Pierre a terrific blow squarely on the cheek. The  sound of the blow  was like the smash of a paddle on smooth water.  Not a riverman but  heard it, and as St. Pierre staggered back,  flung almost from his feet  by its force, a subdued cry of  amazement broke from the waiting men.  Concombre Bateese stood like  one stupefied. And then, in another  flash, St. Pierre had caught  himself and whirled like a wild beast.  Every muscle in his body  was drawn for a gigantic, overwhelming leap;  his eyes blazed; the  fury of a beast was in his face. Before all his  people he had  suffered the deadliest insult that could be offered a  man of the  Three River Country&#8212;a blow struck with the flat of  another's  hand. Anything else one might forgive, but not that. Such a  blow,  if not avenged, was a brand that passed down into the second and   third generations, and even children would call out &quot;Yellow-Back&#8212;   Yellow-Back,&quot; to the one who was coward enough to receive it  without  resentment. A rumbling growl rose in the throat of  Concombre Bateese  in that moment when it seemed as though St.  Pierre Boulain was about  to kill the man who had struck him. He  saw the promise of his own  fight gone in a flash. For no man in  all the northland could now fight  David Carrigan ahead of St.  Pierre. 
  David waited, prepared to meet the rush of a madman. And then, for   a second time, he saw a mighty struggle in the soul of St. Pierre.   The giant held himself back. The fury died out of his face, but  his  great hands remained clenched as he said, for David alone, 
  &quot;That was a playful blow, m'sieu? It was&#8212;a joke?&quot; 
  &quot;It was for you, St. Pierre,&quot; replied Carrigan, &quot;You are a coward   &#8212;and a skunk. I swam to the raft last night, looked through your   window, and saw what happened there. You are not fit for a decent  man  to fight, yet I will fight you, if you are not too great a  coward&#8212;and  dare to let our wagers stand as they were made.&quot; 
  St. Pierre's eyes widened, and for a breath or two he stared at   Carrigan, as if looking into him and not at him. His big hands   relaxed, and slowly the panther-like readiness went out of his  body.  Those who looked beheld the transformation in amazement, for  of all  who waited only St. Pierre and the half-breed had heard  Carrigan's  words, though they had seen and heard the blow of  insult. 
  &quot;You swam to the raft,&quot; repeated St. Pierre in a low voice, as if   doubting what he had heard. &quot;You looked through the window&#8212;and   saw&#8212;&quot; 
  David nodded. He could not cover the sneering poison in his voice,   his contempt for the man who stood before him. 
  &quot;Yes, I looked through the window. And I saw you, and the lowest   woman on the Three Rivers&#8212;the sister of a man I helped to hang,  I&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;STOP!&quot; 
  St. Pierre's voice broke out of him like the sudden crash of   thunder. He came a step nearer, his face livid, his eyes shooting   flame. With a mighty effort he controlled himself again. And then,  as  if he saw something which David could not see, he tried to  smile, and  in that same instant David caught a grin cutting a  great slash across  the face of Concombre Bateese. The change that  came over St. Pierre  now was swift as sunlight coming out from  shadowing cloud. A rumble  grew in his great chest. It broke in a  low note of laughter from his  lips, and he faced the bateau across  the river. 
  &quot;M'sieu, you are sorry for HER. Is that it? You would fight&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;For the cleanest, finest little girl who ever lived&#8212;your wife!&quot; 
  &quot;It is funny,&quot; said St. Pierre, as if speaking to himself, and   still looking at the bateau. &quot;Yes, it is very funny, ma belle   Marie-Anne! He has told you he loves you, and he has kissed your  hair  and held you in his arms&#8212;yet he wants to fight me because he  thinks I  am steeped in sin, and to make me fight in place of  Bateese he has  called my Carmin a low woman! So what else can I  do? I must fight. I  must whip him until he can not walk. And then  I will send him back for  you to nurse, cherie, and for that  blessing I think he will willingly  take my punishment! Is it not  so, m'sieu?&quot; 
  He was smiling and no longer excited when he turned to David. 
  &quot;M'sieu, I will fight you. And the wagers shall stand. And in this   hour let us be honest, like men, and make confession. You love ma   belle Jeanne&#8212;Marie-Anne? Is it not so? And I&#8212;I love my Carmin,   whose brother you hanged, as I love no other woman in the world.  Now,  if you will have it so, let us fight!&quot; 
  He began stripping off his shirt, and with a bellow in his throat   Concombre Bateese slouched away like a beaten gorilla to explain  to  St. Pierre's people the change in the plan of battle. And as  that news  spread like fire in the fir-tops, there came but a  single cry in  response&#8212;shrill and terrible&#8212;and that was from the  throat of Andre,  the Broken Man.
