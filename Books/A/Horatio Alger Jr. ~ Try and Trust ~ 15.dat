  &quot;What does all this mean?&quot; demanded Ralph, in a tone of command. 
  &quot;What right have you to interfere?&quot; said Abner Holden, sulkily. 
  &quot;The right that any man has to prevent murder,&quot; said Ralph,  briefly. 
  &quot;I wasn't going to murder him.&quot; 
  &quot;What were you going to do?&quot; asked Ralph, looking keenly at Abner.  &quot;Why  were you pointing the pistol at him?&quot; 
  &quot;I wanted to frighten him.&quot; 
  &quot;You meant to have him think you were going to fire. I believe you   were.&quot; 
  &quot;Why didn't he come down when I bade him?&quot; 
  &quot;I'll answer that question,&quot; said Herbert, from the top of the  tree.  &quot;Mr. Holden promised to beat me if I would come down, but I  didn't think  that a sufficient inducement.&quot; 
  &quot;I have a right to beat you,&quot; said Abner, doggedly. &quot;Ain't you  bound to  me; tell me that?&quot; 
  &quot;I was,&quot; said Herbert, &quot;and if you had treated me well, I would  have  stayed with you; but I don't mean to remain to be abused.&quot; 
  &quot;You hear the lad's answer,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;I like his spirit, and  I'll  stand by him. He won't return with you.&quot; 
  While this conversation had been going on, Abner had been slowly  edging  himself toward the spot upon which Ralph had thrown the pistol,  which he  had wrenched from him. While Ralph was speaking, he suddenly  darted  forward, seized the weapon, and, facing about, said, with  malicious  triumph, &quot;Now, you're in my power, both of you. We'll see  whether he'll  go back with me or not.&quot; 
  As he spoke he pointed the pistol toward Ralph. 
  The latter laughed contemptuously. 
  This irritated Abner Holden. 
  &quot;I will count ten,&quot; he said. &quot;Unless the boy begins to come down  before  I stop, I fire at you. One&#8212;two&#8212;&#8212;&quot; 
  &quot;Hold!&quot; said Ralph, and, drawing his revolver from beneath his  hunting-  jacket, he pointed it at Abner. &quot;Two can play at that game,  Abner  Holden. This revolver is fully loaded. It gives me six chances  of  hitting you. You have but one chance with your pistol. The moment  your  finger touches the trigger, your doom is sealed. I never miss my  aim.&quot; 
  A sickly hue overspread the face of Abner Holden. He had counted on   Ralph's being unarmed. He saw that he had made an important and most   unlucky mistake. 
  &quot;Put down your revolver,&quot; he said, in a very different tone. &quot;I  wasn't  in earnest, you know.&quot; 
  &quot;I know nothing of the kind,&quot; retorted Ralph. &quot;You looked to me as  if  you were very much in earnest.&quot; 
  Still with his revolver he covered Abner. 
  &quot;Put down your weapon,&quot; said Abner, nervously. &quot;It might go off.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it might,&quot; returned Ralph. &quot;I will lower it, on one  condition.&quot; 
  &quot;What is that?&quot; 
  &quot;That you lay down your pistol on the ground.&quot; 
  Abner demurred, but finally felt compelled to do as he was  commanded. 
  &quot;That is well,&quot; said Ralph, quietly. &quot;Now, I will take care that  you are  not tempted by it again.&quot; 
  He walked toward the pistol, lifted it, and, pointing it in the  reverse  direction, fired it off among the trees. 
  &quot;So much for that,&quot; he said. &quot;Now, Herbert, you may come down.&quot; 
  Herbert complied promptly. He felt the utmost confidence in the  prowess  and good faith of his new friend, and did not fear to descend,  though  his bitterest enemy awaited him beneath. 
  Meanwhile an idea struck Abner Holden. He saw that he was no match  for  Herbert as long as Ralph chose to befriend him. He resolved to  enlist  the latter on his side. 
  &quot;Hark you, Ralph,&quot; he said, &quot;come aside with me. I wish to speak to  you  a moment.&quot; 
  Ralph followed him a few paces in silence. 
  &quot;Now what is it you have to say to me?&quot; he demanded. 
  &quot;About this boy,&quot; said Abner, insinuatingly. &quot;He is bound to me.&quot; 
  &quot;Well?&quot; 
  &quot;And the law gives me authority over him.&quot; 
  &quot;Well?&quot; 
  &quot;I want him to go back with me.&quot; 
  &quot;Well?&quot; 
  &quot;Will you promise not to interfere between us?&quot; 
  &quot;I can't promise that,&quot; said Ralph, briefly. 
  &quot;Stay a moment,&quot; said Abner, seeing that he was on the point of  leaving  him; &quot;of course, I am willing to make it worth your while.  I'll give  you&#8212;well, three dollars, to help me secure him, and carry  him back to  my house.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you take me for?&quot; asked Ralph, looking at the other,  steadily. 
  &quot;For a poor man,&quot; said Abner. &quot;Think a moment. Three dollars will  buy  you provisions for a week. They couldn't be more easily earned. In  fact,  you needn't do anything. Only promise not to interfere between  the boy  and myself.&quot; 
  Ralph turned upon him scornfully. 
  &quot;I have promised the boy my protection,&quot; he said, &quot;and you would  have me  forfeit my word for a paltry three dollars?&quot; 
  &quot;I'll give you five,&quot; said Abner, supposing that the sum he had  offered  was not sufficient. 
  &quot;Not for five dollars, nor five thousand,&quot; returned Ralph, shortly.  &quot;I  thought you meant to insult me, but I see you only judge me by  yourself.  The boy shall not return with you. Make up your mind to  that.&quot; 
  &quot;I can have you arrested,&quot; said Abner, angrily. 
  Ralph laughed. 
  &quot;Let that comfort you for the loss of the boy,&quot; he said. 
  &quot;I'll have the boy, too,&quot; muttered Abner, turning to leave them. 
  &quot;Where are you going?&quot; demanded Ralph. 
  &quot;I am going home.&quot; 
  &quot;Not yet.&quot; 
  &quot;Why not?&quot; demanded Abner, facing about. 
  &quot;Because I can't spare you yet.&quot; 
  &quot;What right have you to interfere with my movements?&quot; said Abner. 
  &quot;None, perhaps; but I will inquire into that afterward. It is  enough  that, for the present, you must stay here.&quot; 
  &quot;I shall do no such thing,&quot; said Abner, and he again turned to go. 
  Ralph deliberately lifted his weapon, and took aim. 
  &quot;What do you say now?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Surely, you will not fire at me,&quot; said Abner, turning pale. 
  &quot;Not if you remain where you are.&quot; 
  &quot;How long do you mean to keep me?&quot; demanded Abner, sullenly. 
  &quot;As long as may be necessary. That is all. Herbert, go into the  cabin  and look in one corner for a cord.&quot; 
  Herbert soon returned with a stout cord, tough and strong. 
  &quot;What are you going to do with that?&quot; asked Abner suspiciously. 
  I'm going to bind you,&quot; said Ralph, coolly. 
  &quot;I'll have the law on you for this,&quot; said Abner, hoarsely. 
  &quot;All in good time,&quot; said Ralph. &quot;But I advise you to consider  whether  the law has nothing to say against attempted murder.&quot; 
  &quot;What do you mean by that?&quot; 
  &quot;I mean that you attempted to murder this boy, and would have done  so,  in all probability, if I had not interfered. When I am arrested, I  shall  feel it my duty to make this known to the authorities.&quot; 
  Abner was silent. He felt that Ralph's testimony would have an ugly   look. 
  &quot;Let me go,&quot; he said, after a pause. &quot;You needn't be afraid of my   troubling either of you. Don't tie me.&quot; 
  &quot;Abner Holden,&quot; said Ralph, &quot;I know you, and I know you are not to  be  trusted. I have resolved to help this boy to escape from you, and I  mean  to do it effectually. For this purpose, I must subject you to  temporary  inconvenience. I advise you not to resist.&quot; 
  He had already tied the hands of Abner Holden, who, as he looked  into  the fearless, resolute face of the Ranger, felt that it would not  do to  resist. It chafed him most to think that Herbert, his bound boy,  should  be a witness of his humiliation, and he scowled savagely at our  hero.  But Herbert showed no triumph. His was a brave and generous  nature, and  had it rested with him, he would have let Mr. Holden go,  but he did not  think it best to interfere. 
  Ralph quickly tied both hands and feet, and then took the helpless  body  of Abner into the cabin, where he placed him in one corner. 
  &quot;Are you thirsty?&quot; he asked. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said Abner, sullenly. 
  Ralph placed a cup of water to his lips. He also placed a loaf of  bread  beside him, which, though his hands were tied at the wrist, he  would  still be able to reach, and then beckoned to Herbert. 
  &quot;Come,&quot; he said, &quot;it is time that we were going.&quot; 
  Abner gnashed his teeth with anger, as he watched them issue from  the  cabin together, and felt how utterly helpless he was to prevent  them.
