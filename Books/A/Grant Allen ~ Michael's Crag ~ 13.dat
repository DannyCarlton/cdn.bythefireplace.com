Tyrrel left Erasmus Walker's house that morning in a turmoil of  mingled exultation and fear. At least he had done his best to atone  for the awful results of his boyish act of criminal thoughtlessness.  He had tried to make it possible for Cleer to marry Eustace, and  thereby to render the Trevennacks happier in their sonless old age;  and what was more satisfactory still, he had crippled himself in doing  it. There was comfort even in that. Expiation, reparation! He wouldn't  have cared for the sacrifice so much if it had cost him less. But it  would cost him dear indeed. He must set to work at once now and raise  the needful sum by mortgaging Penmorgan up to the hilt to do it.    
After all, of course, the directors might choose some other design  than Eustace's. But he had done what he could. And he would hope for  the best, at any rate. For Cleer's sake, if the worst came, he would  have risked and lost much. While if Cleer's life was made happy, he  would be happy in the thought of it.    
He hailed another hansom, and drove off, still on fire, to his  lawyer's in Victoria Street. On the way, he had to go near Paddington  Station. He didn't observe, as he did so, a four-wheel cab that passed  him with luggage on top, from Ivybridge to London. It was the  Trevennacks, just returned from their holiday on Dartmoor. But Michael  Trevennack had seen him; and his brow grew suddenly dark. He pinched  his nails into his palm at sight of that hateful creature, though not  a sound escaped him; for Cleer was in the carriage, and the man was  Eustace's friend. Trevennack accepted Eustace perforce, after that  night on Michael's Crag; for he knew it was politic; and indeed, he  liked the young man himself well enough--there was nothing against him  after all, beyond his friendship with Tyrrel; but had it not been for  the need for avoiding scandal after the adventure on the rock, he  would never have allowed Cleer to speak one word to any friend or  acquaintance of her brother's murderer.    
As it was, however, he never alluded to Tyrrel in any way before  Cleer. He had learnt to hold his tongue. Madman though he was, he knew  when to be silent.    
That evening at home, Cleer had a visit from Eustace, who came round  to tell her how Tyrrel had been to see the great engineer, Erasmus  Walker; and how it was all a mistake that Walker was going to send in  plans for the Wharfedale Viaduct--nay, how the big man had approved of  his own design, and promised to give it all the support in his power.  For Tyrrel was really an awfully kind friend, who had pushed things  for him like a brick, and deserved the very best they could both of  them say about him.    
But of course Eustace hadn't the faintest idea himself by what manner  of persuasion Walter Tyrrel had commended his friend's designs to  Erasmus Walker. If he had, needless to say, he would never have  accepted the strange arrangement.    
"And now, Cleer," Eustace cried, jubilant and radiant with the easy  confidence of youth and love, "I do believe I shall carry the field at  last, and spring at a bound into a first-rate position among engineers  in England."    
"And then?" Cleer asked, nestling close to his side.    
"And then," Eustace went on, smiling tacitly at her native simplicity,  "as it would mean permanent work in superintending and so forth, I see  no reason why--we shouldn't get married immediately."    
They were alone in the breakfast room, where Mrs. Trevennack had left  them. They were alone, like lovers. But in the drawing-room hard by,  Trevennack himself was saying to his wife with a face of suppressed  excitement, "I saw him again to-day, Lucy. I saw him again, that  devil--in a hansom near Paddington. If he stops in town, I'm sure I  don't know what I'm ever to do. I came back from Devonshire, having  fought the devil hard, as I thought, and conquered him. I felt I'd got  him under. I felt he was no match for me. But when I see that man's  face the devil springs up at me again in full force, and grapples with  me. Is he Satan himself? I believe he must be. For I feel I must rush  at him and trample him under foot, as I trampled him long ago on the  summit of Niphates."    
In a tremor of alarm Mrs. Trevennack held his hand. Oh, what would she  ever do if the outbreak came ... before Cleer was married! She could  see the constant strain of holding himself back was growing daily more  and more difficult for her unhappy husband. Indeed, she couldn't bear  it herself much longer. If Cleer didn't marry soon, Michael would  break out openly--perhaps would try to murder that poor man Tyrrel--  and then Eustace would be afraid, and all would be up with them.    
By and by, Eustace came in to tell them the good news. He said nothing  about Tyrrel, at least by name, lest he should hurt Trevennack; he  merely mentioned that a friend of his had seen Erasmus Walker that  day, and that Walker had held out great hopes of success for him in  this Wharfedale Viaduct business. Trevennack listened with a strange  mixture of interest and contempt. He was glad the young man was likely  to get on in his chosen profession--for Cleer's sake, if it would  enable them to marry. But, oh, what a fuss it seemed to him to make  about such a trifle as a mere bit of a valley that one could fly  across in a second--to him who could become    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> ". . . to his proper shape returned <br> A seraph winged: six wings he wore, to shade <br> His lineaments divine; the pair that clad <br> Each shoulder broad, came mantling o'er his breast <br> With regal ornament; the middle pair <br> Girt like a starry zone his waist, and round <br> Skirted his loins and thighs, the third his feet <br> Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail."</small></i></blockquote><br>
And then they talked to <i>him</i> about the difficulties of building a few  hundred yards of iron bridge across a miserable valley! Why, was it  not he and his kind of whom it was written that they came    
<blockquote><i><small> <br> "Gliding through the even <br> On a sunbeam, swift as a shooting star <br> In autumn thwarts the night?"</small></i></blockquote><br>
A viaduct indeed! a paltry human viaduct! What need, with such as him,  to talk of bridges or viaducts?    
As Eustace left that evening, Mrs. Trevennack followed him out, and  beckoned him mysteriously into the dining-room at the side for a  minute's conversation. The young man followed her, much wondering what  this strange move could mean. Mrs. Trevennack fell back, half faint,  into a chair, and gazed at him with a frightened look very rare on  that brave face of hers. "Oh, Eustace," she said, hurriedly, "do you  know what's happened? Mr. Tyrrel's in town. Michael saw him to-day. He  was driving near Paddington. Now do you think... you could do anything  to keep him out of Michael's way? I dread their meeting. I don't know  whether you know it, but Michael has some grudge against him. For  Cleer's sake and for yours, do keep them apart, I beg of you. If they  meet, I can't answer for what harm may come of it."    
Eustace was taken aback at her unexpected words. Not even to Cleer had  he ever hinted in any way at the strange disclosure Walter Tyrrel made  to him that first day at Penmorgan. He hesitated how to answer her  without betraying his friend's secret. At last he said, as calmly as  he could, "I guessed, to tell you the truth, there was some cause of  quarrel. I'll do my very best to keep Tyrrel out of the way, Mrs.  Trevennack, as you wish it. But I'm afraid he won't be going down from  town for some time to come, for he told me only to-day he had business  at his lawyer's, in Victoria Street, Westminster, which might keep him  here a fortnight. Indeed, I rather doubt whether he'll care to go down  again until he knows for certain, one way or the other, about the  Wharfedale Viaduct."    
Mrs. Trevennack sank back in her chair, very pale and wan. "Oh, what  shall we do if they meet?" she cried, wringing her hands in despair.  "What shall we do if they meet? This is more than I can endure.  Eustace, Eustace, I shall break down. My burden's too heavy for me!"    
The young man leant over her like a son. "Mrs. Trevennack," he said,  gently, smoothing her silvery white hair with sympathetic fingers, "I  think I can keep them apart. I'll speak seriously to Tyrrel about it.  He's a very good fellow, and he'll do anything I ask of him. I'm sure  he'll try to avoid falling in with your husband. He's my kindest of  friends; and he'd cut off his hand to serve me."    
One word of sympathy brought tears into Mrs. Trevennack's eyes. She  looked up through them, and took the young man's hand in hers. "It was  <i>he</i> who spoke to Erasmus Walker, I suppose," she murmured, slowly.    
And Eustace, nodding assent, answered in a low voice, "It was he, Mrs.  Trevennack. He's a dear good fellow."    
The orphaned mother clasped her hands. This was too, too much. And  Michael, if the fit came upon him, would strangle that young man, who  was doing his best after all for Cleer and Eustace!    
But that night in his bed Trevennack lay awake, chuckling grimly to  himself in an access of mad triumph. He fancied he was fighting his  familiar foe, on a tall Cornish peak, in archangelic fashion; and he  had vanquished his enemy, and was trampling on him furiously. But the  face of the fallen seraph was not the face of Michael Angelo's Satan,  as he oftenest figured it--for Michael Angelo, his namesake, was one  of Trevennack's very chiefest admirations;--it was the face of Walter  Tyrrel, who killed his dear boy, writhing horribly in the dust, and  crying for mercy beneath him.
