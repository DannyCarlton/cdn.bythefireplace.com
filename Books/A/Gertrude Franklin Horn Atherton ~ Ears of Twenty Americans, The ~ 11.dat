A few hours later Dona Eustaquia sat in the large and cooler sala  with Captain Brotherton. He read Shakespeare to her whilst she fanned  herself, her face aglow with intelligent pleasure. She had not broached  to him the uprising in the South lest it should lead to bitter words.  Although an American and a Protestant, few friends had ever stood so  close to her.    
He laid down the book as Russell and Benicia entered the room. Dona  Eustaquia's heavy brows met.    
"Thou knowest that I do not allow thee to walk with on the street," she  said in Spanish.    
"But, mamacita, he is my husband. We were married this morning at  Blandina's," Excitement had tuned Benicia's spirit to its accustomed  pitch, and her eyes danced with mischief. Moreover, although she  expected violent reproaches, she knew the tenacious strength of her  mother's affection, and had faith in speedy forgiveness.    
Brotherton opened his eyes, but Dona Eustaquia moved back her head  impatiently. "That silly joke!" Then she smiled at her own impatience.  What was Benicia but a spoiled child, and spoiled children would disobey  at times. "Welcome, my son," she said to Russell, extending her hand.  "We celebrate your marriage at the supper to-night, and the Captain  helps us, no? my friend."    
"Let us have chicken with red pepper and tomato sauce," cried Russell.  "And rice with saffron; and that delightful dish with which I  remonstrate all night--olives and cheese and hard-boiled eggs and red  peppers all rolled up in corn-meal cakes."    
"Enchiladas? You have them! Now, both you go over to the corner and talk  not loud, for I wish to hear my friend read."    
Russell, lifting his shoulders, did as he was bidden. Benicia, with a  gay laugh, kissed her mother and flitted like a butterfly about the  room, singing gay little snatches of song.    
"Oh, mamacita, mamacita," she chanted. "Thou wilt not believe thou hast  lost thy little daughter. Thou wilt not believe thou hast a son. Thou  wilt not believe I shall sleep no more in the little brass bed--"    
"Benicia, hold thy saucy tongue! Sit down!" And this Benicia finally  consented to do, although smothered laughter came now and again from the  corner.    
Dona Eustaquia sat easily against the straight back of her chair,  looking very handsome and placid as Brotherton read and expounded "As  You Like It" to her. Her gown of thin black silk threw out the fine  gray tones of her skin; about her neck and chest was a heavy chain of  Californian gold; her dense lustreless hair was held high with a shell  comb banded with gold; superb jewels weighted her little white hands; in  her small ears were large hoops of gold studded with black pearls. She  was perfectly contented in that hour. Her woman's vanity was at peace  and her eager mind expanding.    
The party about the supper table in the evening was very gay. The long  room was bare, but heavy silver was beyond the glass doors of the  cupboard; a servant stood behind each chair; the wines were as fine  as any in America, and the favourite dishes of the Americans had been  prepared. Even Brotherton, although more nervous than was usual with  him, caught the contagion of the hour and touched his glass more than  once to that of the woman whose overwhelming personality had more than  half captured a most indifferent heart.    
After supper they sat on the corridor, and Benicia sang her mocking  love-songs and danced El Son to the tinkling of her own guitar.    
"Is she not a light-hearted child?" asked her mother. "But she has her  serious moments, my friend. We have been like the sisters. Every path of  the pine woods we walk together, arm in arm. We ride miles on the beach  and sit down on the rocks for hours and try to think what the seals  say one to the other. Before you come I have friends, but no other  companion; but it is good for me you come, for she think only of  flirting since the Americans take Monterey. Mira! Look at her flash the  eyes at Senor Russell. It is well he has the light heart like herself."    
Brotherton made no reply.    
"Give to me the guitar," she continued.    
Benicia handed her the instrument and Dona Eustaquia swept the chords  absently for a moment then sang the song of the troubadour. Her rich  voice was like the rush of the wind through the pines after the light  trilling of a bird, and even Russell sat enraptured. As she sang the  colour came into her face, alight with the fire of youth. Her low notes  were voluptuous, her high notes rang with piercing sadness. As she  finished, a storm of applause came from Alvarado Street, which pulsed  with life but a few yards below them.    
"No American woman ever sang like that," said Brotherton. He rose and  walked to the end of the corridor. "But it is a part of Monterey."    
"Most enchanting of mothers-in-law," said Russell, "you have made it  doubly hard for us to leave you; but it grows late and my wife and I  must go. Good night," and he raised her hand to his lips.    
"Good night, my son."    
"Mamacita, good night," and Benicia, who had fluttered into the house  and found a reboso, kissed her mother, waved her hand to Brotherton, and  stepped from the corridor to the street.    
"Come here, senorita!" cried her mother. "No walk to-night, for I have  not the wish to walk myself."    
"But I go with my husband, mamma."    
"Oh, no more of that joke without sense! Senor Russell, go home, that  she have reason for one moment."    
"But, dear Dona Eustaquia, won't you understand that we are really  married?"    
Dona Eustaquia's patience was at an end. She turned to Brotherton and  addressed a remark to him. Russell and Benicia conferred a moment, then  the young man walked rapidly down the street.    
"Has he gone?" asked Dona Eustaquia. "Then let us go in the house, for  the fog comes from the bay."    
They went into the little sala and sat about the table. Dona Eustaquia  picked up a silver dagger she used as a paper cutter and tapped a book  with it.    
"Ay, this will not last long," she said to Brotherton. "I much am afraid  your Commodore send you to the South to fight with our men."    
"I shall return," said Brotherton, absently. His eyes were fixed on the  door.    
"But it will not be long that you will be there, my friend. Many people  are not killed in our wars. Once there was a great battle at Point  Rincon, near Santa Barbara, between Castro and Carillo. Carillo have  been appointed governor by Mejico, and Alvarado refuse to resign. They  fight for three days, and Castro manage so well he lose only one man,  and the others run away and not lose any."    
Brotherton laughed. "I hope all our battles may be as bloodless," he  said, and then drew a short breath.    
Russell, accompanied by Don Jorje and Dona Francesca Hernandez and the  priest of Monterey, entered the room.    
Dona Eustaquia rose and greeted her guests with grace and hospitality.    
"But I am glad to see you, my father, my friends. And you always are  welcome, Senor Russell; but no more joke. Where is our Blandina? Sit  down--Why, what is it?"    
The priest spoke.    
"I have that to tell you, Dona Eustaquia, which I fear will give you  great displeasure. I hoped not to be the one to tell it. I was weak to  consent, but these young people importuned me until I was weary. Dona  Eustaquia, I married Benicia to the Senor Russell to-day."    
Dona Eustaquia's head had moved forward mechanically, her eyes staring  incredulously from the priest to the other members of the apprehensive  group. Suddenly her apathy left her, her arm curved upward like the neck  of a snake; but as she sprang upon Benicia her ferocity was that of a  tiger.    
"What!" she shrieked, shaking the girl violently by the shoulder. "What!  ingrate! traitor! Thou hast married an American, a Protestant!"    
Benicia burst into terrified sobs. Russell swung the girl from her  mother's grasp and placed his arm around her.    
"She is mine now," he said. "You must not touch her again."    
"Yours! Yours!" screamed Dona Eustaquia, beside herself. "Oh, Mother of  God!" She snatched the dagger from the table and, springing backward,  plunged it into the cross.    
"By that sign I curse thee," she cried. "Accursed be the man who has  stolen my child! Accursed be the woman who has betrayed her mother and  her country! God! God!--I implore thee, let her die in her happiest  hour."
