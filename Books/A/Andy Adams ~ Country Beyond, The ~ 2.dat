  She followed Peter. For a long time the storm had been gathering   in her brain, a storm which she had held back, smothered under her   unhappiness, so that only Peter had seen the lightning-flashes of  it.  But today the betrayal had forced itself from her lips, and in  a hard  little voice she had told Jolly Roger&#8212;the stranger who had  come into  the black forest&#8212;how her mother and father had died of  the same  plague more than ten years ago, and how Jed Hawkins and  his woman had  promised to keep her for three silver fox skins  which her father had  caught before the sickness came. That much  the woman had confided in  her, for she was only six when it  happened. And she had not dared to  look at Jolly Roger when she  told him of what had passed since then,  so she saw little of the  hardening in his face as he listened. But he  had blown his nose&#8212;  hard. It was a way with Jolly Roger, and she had  not known him  long enough to understand what it meant. And a little  later he had  asked her if he might touch her hair&#8212;and his big hand  had lain  for a moment on her head, as gently as a woman's. 
  Like a warm glow in her heart still remained the touch of that   hand. It had given her a new courage, and a new thrill, just as   Peter's vanquishment of unknown monsters that day had done the  same  for him. Peter was no longer afraid, and the girl was no  longer  afraid, and together they went along the slope of the  ridge, until  they came to a dried-up coulee which was choked with  a wild upheaval  of rock. Here Peter suddenly stopped, with his  nose to the ground, and  then his legs stiffened, and for the first  time the girl heard the  babyish growl in his throat. For a moment  she stood very still, and  listened, and faintly there came to her  a sound, as if someone was  scraping rock against rock. The girl  drew in a quick breath; she stood  straighter, and Peter&#8212;looking  up&#8212;saw her eyes flashing, and her lips  apart. And then she bent  down, and picked up a jagged stick. 
  &quot;We'll go up, Peter,&quot; she whispered. &quot;It's one of his hiding-   places!&quot; 
  There was a wonderful thrill in the knowledge that she was no   longer afraid, and the same thrill was in Peter's swiftly beating   little heart as he followed her. They went very quietly, the girl  on  tip-toe, and Peter making no sound with his soft footpads, so  that Jed  Hawkins was still on his knees, with his back toward  them, when they  came out into a square of pebbles and sand between  two giant masses of  rock. Yesterday, or the day before, both Peter  and Nada would have  slunk back, for Jed was at his devil's work,  and only evil could come  to the one who discovered him at it. He  had scooped out a pile of sand  from under the edge of the biggest  rock, and was filling half a dozen  grimy leather flasks from a jug  which he had pulled from the hole. And  then he paused to drink.  They could hear the liquor gurgling down his  throat. 
  Nada tapped the end of her stick against the rock, and like a shot   the man whirled about to face them. His face turned livid when he  saw  who it was, and he drew himself up until he stood on his feet,  his two  big fists clenched, his yellow teeth snarling at her. 
  &quot;You damned&#8212;spy!&quot; he cried chokingly. &quot;If you was a man&#8212;I'd kill   you!&quot; 
  The girl did not shrink. Her face did not whiten. Two bright spots   flamed in her cheeks, and Hawkins saw the triumph shining in her   eyes. And there was a new thing in the odd twist of her red lips,  as  she said tauntingly. 
  &quot;If I was a man, Jed Hawkins&#8212;you'd run!&quot; 
  He took a step toward her. 
  &quot;You'd run,&quot; she repeated, meeting him squarely, and taking a   tighter grip of her stick. &quot;I ain't ever seen you hit anything but  a  woman, an' a girl, or some poor animal that didn't dare bite  back.  You're a coward, Jed Hawkins, a low-down, sneakin,' whiskey-  sellin'  coward&#8212;and you oughta die!&quot; 
  Even Peter sensed the cataclysmic change that had come in this   moment between the two big rocks. It held something in the air,  like  the impending crash of dynamite, or the falling down of the  world. He  forgot himself, and looked up at his mistress, a  wonderful, slim  little thing standing there at last unafraid  before the future&#8212;and in  his dog heart and soul a part of the  truth came to him, and he planted  his big feet squarely in front  of Jed Hawkins, and snarled at him as  he had never snarled before  in his life. 
  And the bootlegger, for a moment, was stunned, For a while back he   had humored the girl a little, to hold her in peace and without   suspicion until Mooney was able to turn over her body-money. After   that&#8212;after he had delivered her to the other's shack&#8212;it would  all  be up to Mooney, he figured. And this was what had come of his   peace-loving efforts! She was taking advantage of him, defying  him,  spying upon him&#8212;the brat he had fed and brought up for ten  years! Her  beauty as she stood there did not hold him back. It was  punishment she  needed, a beating, a hair-pulling, until there was  no breath left in  her impudent body. He sprang forward, and Peter  let out a wild yip as  he saw Nada raise her stick. But she was a  moment too slow. The man's  hand caught it, and his right hand shot  forward and buried itself in  the thick, soft mass of her hair. 
  It was then that something broke loose in Peter. For this day,   this hour, this minute the gods of destiny had given him birth.  All  things in the world were blotted out for him except one&#8212;the  six  inches of naked shank between the bootlegger's trouser-leg and  his  shoe. He dove in. His white teeth, sharp as stiletto-points,  sank into  it. And a wild and terrible yell came from Jed Hawkins  as he loosed  the girl's hair. Peter heard the yell, and his teeth  sank deeper in  the flesh of the first thing he had ever hated. It  was the girl, more  than Peter, who realized the horror of what  followed. The man bent  down and his powerful fingers closed round  Peter's scrawny neck, and  Peter felt his wind suddenly shut off,  and his mouth opened. Then Jed  Hawkins drew back the arm that held  him, as he would have drawn it  back to fling a stone. 
  With a scream the girl tore at him as his arm straightened out,   and Peter went hurtling through the air. Her stick struck him   fiercely across the face, and in that same moment there was a   sickening, crushing thud as Peter's loosely-jointed little body   struck against the face of the great rock. When Nada turned Peter  was  groveling in the sand, his hips and back broken down, but his  bright  eyes were on her, and without a whimper or a whine he was  struggling  to drag himself toward her. Only Jolly Roger could tell  the story of  how Peter's mother had died for a woman, and in this  moment it must  have been that her spirit entered into Peter's  soul, for the pain of  his terrible hurt was forgotten in his  desire to drag himself back to  the feet of the girl, and die  facing her enemy&#8212;the man. He did not  know that he was dragging  his broken body only an inch at a time  through the sand. But the  girl saw the terrible truth, and with a cry  of agony which all of  Hawkin's torture could not have wrung from her  she ran to him, and  fell upon her knees, and gathered him tenderly in  her arms. Then,  in a flash, she was on her feet, facing Jed Hawkins  like a little  demon. 
  &quot;For that&#8212;I'll kill you!&quot; she panted. &quot;I will. I'll kill you!&quot; 
  The blow of her stick had half blinded the bootlegger's one eye,   but he was coming toward her. Swift as a bird Nada turned and ran,   and as the man's footsteps crunched in the gravel and rock behind  her  a wild fear possessed her&#8212;fear for Peter, and not for  herself. Very  soon Hawkins was left behind, cursing at the  futility of the pursuit,  and at the fate that had robbed him of an  eye. 
  Down the coulee and out into the green meadowland of the plain ran   Nada, her hair streaming brightly in the sun, her arms clutching   Peter to her breast. Peter was whimpering now, crying softly and   piteously, just as once upon a time she had heard a baby cry&#8212;a   little baby that was dying. And her soul cried out in agony, for  she  knew that Peter, too, was dying. And as she stumbled onward&#8212;  on  toward the black forest, she put her face down to Peter and  sobbed  over and over again his name. 
  &quot;Peter&#8212;Peter&#8212;Peter&#8212;&quot; 
  And Peter, joyous and grateful for her love and the sound of her   voice even in these moments, thrust out his tongue and caressed  her  cheek, and the girl's breath came in a great sob as she  staggered on. 
  &quot;It's all right now, Peter,&quot; she crooned. &quot;It's all right, baby.   He won't hurt you any more, an' we're goin' across the creek to   Mister Roger's cabin, an' you'll be happy there. You'll be happy&#8212;  &quot; 
  Her voice choked full, and her mother-heart seemed to break inside   her, just as life had gone out of that other mother's heart when  the  baby died. For their grief, in God's reckoning of things, was  the  same; and little Peter, sensing the greatness of this thing  that had  made them one in flesh and blood, snuggled his wiry face  closer in her  neck, crying softly to her, and content to die there  close to the  warmth of the creature he loved. 
  &quot;Don't cry, baby,&quot; she soothed. &quot;Don't cry, Peter, dear. It'll   soon be all right&#8212;all right&#8212;&quot; And the sob came again into her   throat, and clung there like a choking fist, until they came to  the  edge of the big forest. 
  She looked down, and saw that Peter's eyes were closed; and not   until then did the miracle of understanding come upon her fully  that  there was no difference at all between the dying baby's face  and dying  Peter's, except that one had been white and soft, and  Peter's was  different&#8212;and covered with hair. 
  &quot;God'll take care o' you, Peter,&quot; she whispered. &quot;He will&#8212;God,   'n' me, and Mister Roger&#8212;&quot; 
  She knew there was untruth in what she was saying for no one, not   even God, would ever take care of Peter again&#8212;in life. His still   little face and the terrible grief in her own heart told her that.   For Peter's back was broken, and he was going&#8212;going even now&#8212;as  she  ran moaningly with him through the deep aisles of the forest.  But  before he died, before his heart stopped beating in her arms,  she  wanted to reach Jolly Roger's friendly cabin, in the big swamp  beyond  the creek. It was not that he could save Peter, but  something told her  that Jolly Roger's presence would make Peter's  dying easier, both for  Peter and for her, for in this first glad  spring of her existence the  stranger in the forest shack had  brought sunshine and hope and new  dreams into her life; and they  had set him up, she and Peter, as they  would have set up a god on  a shrine. 
  So she ran for the fording place on Sucker Creek, which was a good   half mile above the shack in which the stranger was living. She  was  staggering, and short of wind, when she came to the ford, and  when she  saw the whirl and rush of water ahead of her she  remembered what Jolly  Roger had said about the flooding of the  creek, and her eyes widened.  Then she looked down at Peter,  piteously limp and still in her arms,  and she drew a quick breath  and made up her mind. She knew that at  this shallow place the  water could not be more than up to her waist,  even at the flood-  tide. But it was running like a mill-race. 
  She put her lips down to Peter's fuzzy little face, and held them   there for a moment, and kissed him. 
  &quot;We'll make it, Peter,&quot; she whispered. &quot;We ain't afraid, are we,   baby? We'll make it&#8212;sure&#8212;sure&#8212;we'll make it&#8212;&quot; 
  She set out bravely, and the current swished about her ankles, to   her knees, to her hips. And then, suddenly, unseen hands under the   water seemed to rouse themselves, and she felt them pulling and   tugging at her as the water deepened to her waist. In another  moment  she was fighting, fighting to hold her feet, struggling to  keep the  forces from driving her downstream. And then came the  supreme moment,  close to the shore for which she was striving. She  felt herself giving  away, and she cried out brokenly for Peter not  to be afraid. And then  something drove pitilessly against her  body, and she flung out one  arm, holding Peter close with the  other&#8212;and caught hold of a bit of  stub that protruded like a  handle from the black and slippery log the  flood-water had brought  down upon her. 
  &quot;We're all right, Peter,&quot; she cried, even in that moment when she   knew she had lost. &quot;We're all ri&#8212;&quot; 
  And then suddenly the bright glory of her head went down, and with   her went Peter, still held to her breast under the sweeping rush  of  the flood. 
  Even then it was thought of Peter that filled her brain. Somehow   she was not afraid. She was not terrified, as she had often been  of  the flood-rush of waters that smashed down the creeks in  springtime.  An inundating roar was over her, under her, and all  about her; it beat  in a hissing thunder against the drums of her  ears, yet it did not  frighten her as she had sometimes been  frightened. Even in that black  chaos which was swiftly suffocating  the life from her, unspoken words  of cheer for Peter formed in her  heart, and she struggled to hold him  to her, while with her other  hand she fought to raise herself by the  stub of the log to which  she clung. For she was not thinking of him as  Peter, the dog, but  as something greater&#8212;something that had fought  for her that day,  and because of her had died. 
  Suddenly she felt a force pulling her from above. It was the big   log, turning again to that point of equilibrium which for a space  her  weight had destroyed. In the edge of a quieter pool where the  water  swirled but did not rush, her brown head appeared, and then  her white  face, and with a last mighty effort she thrust up Peter  so that his  dripping body was on the log. Sobbingly she filled her  lungs with air.  But the drench of water and her hair blinded her  so that she could not  see. And she found all at once that the  strength had gone from her  body. Vainly she tried to drag herself  up beside Peter, and in the  struggle she raised herself a little,  so that a low-hanging branch of  a tree swept her like a mighty arm  from the log. 
  With a cry she reached out for Peter. But he was gone, the log was   gone, and she felt a vicious pulling at her hair, as Jed Hawkins   himself had often pulled it, and for a few moments the current   pounded against her body and the tree-limb swayed back and forth  as  it held her there by her hair. 
  If there was pain from that tugging, Nada did not feel it. She   could see now, and thirty yards below her was a wide, quiet pool  into  which the log was drifting. Peter was gone. And then,  suddenly, her  heart seemed to stop its beating, and her eyes  widened, and in that  moment of astounding miracle she forgot that  she was hanging by her  hair in the ugly lip of the flood, with  slippery hands beating and  pulling at her from below. For she saw  Peter&#8212;Peter in the edge of the  pool&#8212;making his way toward the  shore! For a space she could not  believe. It must be his dead body  drifting. It could not be  Peter&#8212;swimming! And yet&#8212;his head was  above the water&#8212;he was moving  shoreward&#8212;he was struggling&#8212; 
  Frantically she tore at the detaining clutch above her. Something   gave way. She felt the sharp sting of it, and then she plunged  into  the current, and swept down with it, and in the edge of the  pool  struck out with all her last strength until her feet touched  bottom,  and she could stand. She wiped the water from her eyes,  sobbing in her  breathless fear&#8212;her mighty hope. Peter had reached  the shore. He had  dragged himself out, and had crumpled down in a  broken heap&#8212;but he  was facing her, his bright eyes wide open and  questing for her. Slowly  Nada went to him. Until now, when it was  all over, she had not  realized how helplessly weak she was.  Something was turning round and  round in her head, and she was so  dizzy that the shore swam before her  eyes, and it seemed quite  right to her that Peter should be alive&#8212;and  not dead. She was  still in a foot of water when she fell on her knees  and dragged  herself the rest of the way to him, and gathered him in  her arms  again, close up against her wet, choking breast. 
  And there the sun shone down upon them, without the shade of a   twig overhead; and the water that a little while before had sung  of  death rippled with its old musical joy, and about them the  birds sang,  and very near to them a pair of mating red-squirrels  chattered and  played in a mountain-ash tree. And Nada's hair  brightened in the sun,  and began to ripple into curls at the end,  and Peter's bristling  whiskers grew dry&#8212;so that half an hour  after she had dragged herself  out of the water there was a new  light in the girl's eyes, and a color  in her cheeks that was like  the first dawning of summer pink in the  heart of a rose. 
  &quot;We're a'most dry enough to go to Mister Jolly Roger, Peter,&quot; she   whispered, a little thrill in her voice. 
  She stood up, and shook out her half dry hair, and then picked up   Peter&#8212;and winced when he gave a little moan. 
  &quot;He'll fix you, Peter,&quot; she comforted. &quot;An' it'll be so nice over   here&#8212;with him.&quot; 
  Her eyes were looking ahead, down through the glory of the sun-   filled forest, and the song of birds and the beauty of the world   filled her soul, and a new and wonderful freedom seemed to thrill  in  the touch of the soft earth under her feet. 
  &quot;Flowers,&quot; she cried softly. &quot;Flowers, an' birds, an' the sun,   Peter&#8212;&quot; She paused a moment, as if listening to the throb of  light  and life about her. And then, &quot;I guess we'll go to Mister  Jolly Roger  now,&quot; she said. 
  She shook her hair again, so that it shone in a soft and   rebellious glory about her, and the violet light grew a little  darker  in her eyes, and the color a bit deeper in her cheeks as  she walked on  into the forest over the faintly worn foot-trail  that led to the old  cabin where Jolly Roger was keeping himself  away from the eyes of men.
