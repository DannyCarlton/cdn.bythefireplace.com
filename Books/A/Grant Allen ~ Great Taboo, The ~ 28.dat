In Tu-Kila-Kila's temple-hut, meanwhile, the jealous, revengeful god,  enshrined among his skeletons, was having in his turn an anxious and  doubtful time of it. Ever since his sacred blood had stained the dust of  earth by the Frenchman's cottage and in his own temple, Tu-Kila-Kila,  for all his bluster, had been deeply stirred and terrified in his inmost  soul by that unlucky portent. A savage, even if he be a god, is always  superstitious. Could it be that his own time was, indeed, drawing nigh?  That he, who had remorselessly killed and eaten so many hundreds of human  victims, was himself to fall a prey to some more successful competitor?  Had the white-faced stranger, the King of the Rain, really learned the  secrets of the Great Taboo from the Soul of all dead parrots? Did that  mysterious bird speak the tongue of these new fire-bearing Korongs,  whose doom was fixed for the approaching solstice? Tu-Kila-Kila wondered  and doubted. His suspicions were keen, and deeply aroused. Late that  night he still lurked by the sacred banyan-tree, and when at last he  retired to his own inner temple, white with the grinning skulls of the  victims he had devoured, it was with strict injunctions to Fire and  Water, and to his Eyes that watched there, to bring him word at once of  any projected aggression on the part of the stranger.    
Within the temple-hut, however, Ula awaited him. That was a pleasant  change. The beautiful, supple, satin-skinned Polynesian looked more  beautiful and more treacherous than ever that fateful evening. Her great  brown limbs, smooth and glossy as pearl, were set off by a narrow girdle  or waistband of green and scarlet leaves, twined spirally around her.  Armlets of nautilus shell threw up the dainty plumpness of her soft,  round forearm. A garland hung festooned across one shapely shoulder;  her bosom was bare or but half hidden by the crimson hibiscus that  nestled voluptuously upon it. As Tu-Kila-Kila entered, she lifted her  large eyes, and, smiling, showed two even rows of pearly white teeth. "My  master has come!" she cried, holding up both lissome arms with a gesture  to welcome him. "The great god relaxes his care of the world for a while.  All goes on well. He leaves his sun to sleep and his stars to shine, and  he retires to rest on the unworthy bosom of her, his mate, his meat, that  is honored to love him."    
Tu-Kila-Kila was scarcely just then in a mood for dalliance. "The Queen  of the Clouds comes hither to-morrow," he answered, casting a somewhat  contemptuous glance at Ula's more dusky and solid charms. "I go to  seek her with the wedding gifts early in the morning. For a week she  shall be mine. And after that--" he lifted his tomahawk and brought it  down on a huge block of wood significantly.    
Ula smiled once more, that deep, treacherous smile of hers, and showed  her white teeth even deeper than ever. "If my lord, the great god, rises  so early to-morrow," she said, sidling up toward him voluptuously, "to  seek one more bride for his sacred temple, all the more reason he should  take his rest and sleep soundly to-night. Is he not a god? Are not his  limbs tired? Does he not need divine silence and slumber?"    
Tu-Kila-Kila pouted. "I could sleep more soundly," he said, with a snort,  "if I knew what my enemy, the Korong, is doing. I have set my Eyes to  watch him, yet I do not feel secure. They are not to be trusted. I shall  be happier far when I have killed and eaten him." He passed his hand  across his bosom with a reflective air. You have a great sense of  security toward your enemy, no doubt, when you know that he slumbers,  well digested, within you.    
Ula raised herself on her elbow, and gazed snake-like into his face, "My  lord's Eyes are everywhere," she said, reverently, with every mark of  respect. "He sees and knows all things. Who can hide anything on earth  from his face? Even when he is asleep, his Eyes watch well for him. Then  why should the great god, the Measurer of Heaven and Earth, the King of  Men, fear a white-faced stranger? To-morrow the Queen of the Clouds will  be yours, and the stranger will be abased: ha, ha, he will grieve at it!  To-night, Fire and Water keep guard and watch over you. Whoever would  hurt you must pass through Fire and Water before he reach your door. Fire  would burn, Water would drown. This is a Great Taboo. No stranger dare  face it."    
Tu-Kila-Kila lifted himself up in his thrasonic mood. "If he did," he  cried, swelling himself, "I would shrivel him to ashes with one flash of  my eyes. I would scorch him to a cinder with one stroke of my lightning."    
Ula smiled again, a well-satisfied smile. She was working her man up.  "Tu-Kila-Kila is great," she repeated, slowly. "All earth obeys him. All  heaven fears him."    
The savage took her hand with a doubtful air. "And yet," he said, toying  with it, half irresolute, "when I went to the white-faced stranger's hut  this morning, he did not speak fair; he answered me insolently. His words  were bold. He talked to me as one talks to a man, not to a great god.  Ula, I wonder if he knows my secret?"    
Ula started back in well-affected horror. "A white-faced stranger from  the sun know your secret, O great king!" she cried, hiding her face in a  square of cloth. "See me beat my breast! Impossible! Impossible! No  one of your subjects would dare to tell him so great a taboo. It would be  rank blasphemy. If they did, your anger would utterly consume them!"    
"That is true," Tu-Kila-Kila said, practically, "but I might not discover  it. I am a very great god. My Eyes are everywhere. No corner of the world  is hid from my gaze. All the concerns of heaven and earth are my care,  And, therefore; sometimes, I overlook some detail."    
"No man alive would dare to tell the Great Taboo!" Ula repeated,  confidently. "Why, even I myself, who am the most favored of your  wives, and who am permitted to bask in the light of your presence--even  I, Ula--I do not know it. How much less, then, the spirit from the sun,  the sailing god, the white-faced stranger!"    
Tu-Kila-Kila pursed up his brow and looked preternaturally wise, as the  savage loves to do. "But the parrot," he cried, "the Soul of all dead  parrots! <i>He</i> knew the secret, they say:--I taught it him myself in an  ancient day, many, many years ago--when no man now living was born, save  only I--in another incarnation--and <i>he</i> may have told it. For the  strangers, they say, speak the language of birds; and in the language of  birds did I tell the Great Taboo to him."    
Ula pooh-poohed the mighty man-god's fears. "No, no," she cried, with  confidence; "he can never have told them. If he had, would not your Eyes  that watch ever for all that happens on heaven or earth, have straightway  reported it to you? The parrot died without yielding up the tale. Were it  otherwise, Toko, who loves and worships you, would surely have told me."    
The man-god puckered his brows slightly, as if he liked not the security.  "Well, somehow, Ula," he said, feeling her soft brown arms with his  divine hand, slowly, "I have always had my doubts since that day the Soul  of all dead parrots bit me. A vicious bird! What did he mean by his  bite?" He lowered his voice and looked at her fixedly. "Did not his  spilling my blood portend," he asked, with a shudder of fear, "that  through that ill-omened bird I, who was once Lavita, should cease to be  Tu-Kila-Kila?"    
Ula smiled contentedly again. To say the truth, that was precisely the  interpretation she herself had put on that terrific omen. The parrot had  spilled Tu-Kila-Kila's sacred blood upon the soil of earth. According to  her simple natural philosophy, that was a certain sign that through the  parrot's instrumentality Tu-Kila-Kila's life would be forfeited to the  great eternal earth-spirit. Or, rather, the earth-spirit would claim the  blood of the man Lavita, in whose body it dwelt, and would itself migrate  to some new earthly tabernacle.    
But for all that, she dissembled. "Great god," she cried, smiling, a  benign smile, "you are tired! You are thirsty! Care for heaven and  earth has wearied you out. You feel the fatigue of upholding the sun in  heaven. Your arms must ache. Your thews must give under you. Drink of the  soul-inspiring juice of the kava! My hands have prepared the divine cup.  For Tu-Kila-Kila did I make it--fresh, pure, invigorating!"    
She held the bowl to his lips with an enticing smile. Tu-Kila-Kila  hesitated and glanced around him suspiciously. "What if the white-faced  stranger should come to-night?" he whispered, hoarsely. "He may have  discovered the Great Taboo, after all. Who can tell the ways of the  world, how they come about? My people are so treacherous. Some traitor  may have betrayed it to him."    
"Impossible," the beautiful, snake-like woman answered, with a strong  gesture of natural dissent. "And even if he came, would not kava, the  divine, inspiriting drink of the gods, in which dwell the embodied souls  of our fathers--would not kava make you more vigorous, strong for the  fight? Would it not course through your limbs like fire? Would it not  pour into your soul the divine, abiding strength of your mighty mother,  the eternal earth-spirit?"    
"A little," Tu-Kila-Kila said, yielding, "but not too much. Too much  would stupefy me. When the spirits, that the kava-tree sucks up from the  earth, are too strong within us, they overpower our own strength, so that  even I, the high god--even I can do nothing."    
Ula held the bowl to his lips, and enticed him to drink with her  beautiful eyes. "A deep draught, O supporter of the sun in heaven," she  cried, pressing his arm tenderly. "Am I not Ula? Did I not brew it for  you? Am I not the chief and most favored among your women? I will sit at  the door. I will watch all night. I will not close an eye. Not a footfall  on the ground but my ear shall hear it."    
"Do." Tu-Kila-Kila said, laconically. "I fear Fire and Water. Those gods  love me not. Fain would they make me migrate into some other body. But I  myself like it not. This one suits me admirably. Ula, that kava is  stronger than you are used to make it."    
"No, no," Ula cried, pressing it to his lips a second time, passionately.  "You are a very great god. You are tired; it overcomes you. And if you  sleep, I will watch. Fire and Water dare not disobey your commands. Are  you not great? Your Eyes are everywhere. And I, even I, will be as one of  them."    
The savage gulped down a few more mouthfuls of the intoxicating liquid.  Then he glanced up again suddenly with a quick, suspicious look. The  cunning of his race gave him wisdom in spite of the deadly strength of  the kava Ula had brewed too deep for him. With a sudden resolve, he rose  and staggered out. "You are a serpent, woman!" he cried angrily, seeing  the smile that lurked upon Ula's face. "To-morrow I will kill you. I will  take the white woman for my bride, and she and I will feast off your  carrion body. You have tried to betray me, but you are not cunning  enough, not strong enough. No woman shall kill me. I am a very great god.  I will not yield. I will wait by the tree. This is a trap you have set,  but I do not fall into it. If the King of the Rain comes, I shall be  there to meet him."    
He seized his spear and hatchet and walked forth, erect, without one sign  of drunkenness. Ula trembled to herself as she saw him go. She was  playing a deep game. Had she given him only just enough kava to  strengthen and inspire him?
