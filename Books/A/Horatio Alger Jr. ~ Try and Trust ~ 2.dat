  &quot;Well, wife,&quot; said Mr. Benjamin Stanton, as he sat down to a late   breakfast, &quot;I had a letter from Ohio yesterday.&quot; 
  &quot;From Ohio? Who should write you from Ohio? Anyone I know?&quot; 
  &quot;My sister, Margaret, you remember, moved out there with her  husband ten  years ago.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, it's from her, is it?&quot; said Mrs. Stanton, indifferently. 
  &quot;No,&quot; said her husband with momentary gravity. &quot;It's from a Dr.  Kent,  who attended her in her last illness. Margaret is dead!&quot; 
  &quot;Dear me!&quot; returned Mrs. Stanton, uncomfortably; &quot;and I am just out  of  mourning for my aunt. Do you think it will be necessary for us to  go  into mourning for your sister?&quot; 
  &quot;No, I think not,&quot; said her husband. &quot;Margaret has lived away from  us so  long, and people won't know that we have had a death in the  family  unless we mention it.&quot; 
  &quot;Was that all the letter said&#8212;about the death, I mean?&quot; 
  &quot;Why, no,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, with a little frown. &quot;It seems  Margaret  left a child&#8212;a boy of fourteen; and, as she left no  property, the  doctor suggests that I should send for the boy and  assume the care of  him.&quot; 
  &quot;Upon my word!&quot; said Mrs. Stanton; &quot;you will find yourself in  business  if you undertake to provide for all the beggars' brats that  apply to you  for assistance.&quot; 
  &quot;You must remember that you are speaking of my sister's child,&quot;  said Mr.  Stanton, who, cold and selfish and worldly as he was, had  some touch of  decency about him, and did not relish the term &quot;beggars'  brats,&quot; as  applied to one so nearly related to him. 
  &quot;Well, call him what you like,&quot; said his wife; &quot;only don't be so  foolish  as to go spending your money on him when our children need all  we have.  There's Maria needs a new dress immediately. She says all the  girls at  Signor Madalini's dancing academy dress elegantly, and she's  positively  ashamed to appear in any of her present dresses.&quot; 
  &quot;How much will it cost?&quot; asked Mr. Stanton, opening his pocketbook. 
  &quot;You may hand me seventy-five dollars. I think I can make that do.&quot; 
  Without a word of remonstrance, the money was placed in her hand. 
  &quot;I want some money, too,&quot; said Tom Stanton, who had just disposed  of a  very hearty meal. 
  &quot;What do you want it for, Tom?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, some of the fellows are getting up a club. It's going to be a   select affair, and of course each of us has got to contribute some   money. You see, we are going to hire a room, furnish it nicely with a   carpet, black walnut furniture, and so on, and that'll cost  something.&quot; 
  &quot;Whose idea is it?&quot; 
  &quot;Well, Sam Paget was the first boy that mentioned it.&quot; 
  &quot;Whose son is he?&quot; 
  &quot;His father belongs to the firm of Paget, Norwood Co. He's awful   rich.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, it is one of our first families,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, with   satisfaction. &quot;Is he a friend of yours, Tom?&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, yes, we are quit intimate.&quot; 
  &quot;That's right!&quot; said his father, approvingly. &quot;I am glad you choose  your  friends so well. That's one of the principal reasons I have for  sending  you to an expensive school, to get you well launched into good  society.&quot; 
  &quot;Yes, father, I understand,&quot; said Tom. &quot;You won't find me  associating  with common boys. I hold my head a little too high for  that, I can tell  you.&quot; 
  &quot;That's right, my boy,&quot; said Mr. Stanton, with satisfaction. &quot;And  now  how much money do you want for this club of yours?&quot; 
  &quot;Well,&quot; said Tom, hesitatingly, &quot;thirty or forty dollars.&quot; 
  &quot;Isn't that considerable?&quot; said his father, surprised at the  amount. 
  &quot;Well, you see, father, I want to contribute as much as any of the  boys.  It would seem mean if I didn't. There's only a few of us to  stand the  expense, and we don't want to let in any out of our own  set.&quot; 
  &quot;That's true,&quot; said Mr. Stanton; &quot;I approve of that. It's all very  well  to talk about democracy, but I believe in those of the higher  orders  keeping by themselves.&quot; 
  &quot;Then you'll give the money, father?&quot; said Tom, eagerly. 
  &quot;Yes, Tom, there's forty dollars. It's more than I ought to spare,  but I  am determined you shall stand as good a chance as any of your  school-  fellows. They shan't be able to say that your father stints  you in  anything that your position requires.&quot; 
  &quot;Thank you, father,&quot; said Tom, pocketing the two twenty-dollar  bills  with great satisfaction. 
  The fact was that Tom's assessment amounted to only twenty dollars,  but  he thought it would be a good excuse for getting more out of his  father.  As to the extra money, Tom felt confident that he could find  uses enough  for it. He had latterly, though but fourteen years of age,  contracted  the habit of smoking cigars; a habit which he found rather  expensive,  especially as he felt bound occasionally to treat his  companions. Then  he liked, now and then, to drop in and get an  ice-cream or some  confectionery, and these little expenses counted up. 
  Mr. Stanton was a vain, worldly man. He was anxious to obtain an   entrance into the best society. For this reason, he made it a point to   send his children to the most expensive schools; trusting to their   forming fashionable acquaintances, through whom his whole family might   obtain recognition into those select circles for which he cherished a   most undemocratic respect. For this reason it was that, though not   naturally liberal, he had opened his purse willingly at the demands of   Mrs. Stanton and Tom. 
  &quot;Well,&quot; said Mrs. Stanton, after Tom's little financial affair had  been  adjusted, &quot;what are you going to write to this doctor? Of course  you  won't think of sending for your nephew?&quot; 
  &quot;By no means. He is much better off where he is. I shall write Dr.  Kent  that he is old enough to earn his own living, and I shall  recommend that  he be bound out to some farmer or mechanic in the  neighborhood. It is an  imposition to expect, because I am tolerably  well off, that it is my  duty to support other people's children. My  own are entitled to all I  can do for them.&quot; 
  &quot;That's so, father,&quot; said Tom, who was ready enough to give his  consent  to any proposition of a selfish nature. &quot;Charity begins at  home.&quot; 
  With Tom, by the way, it not only began at home, but it ended  there, and  the same may be said of his father. From time to time Mr.  Stanton's name  was found in the list of donors to some charitable  object, provided his  benevolence was likely to obtain sufficient  publicity, Mr. Stanton did  not believe in giving in secret. What was  the use of giving away money  unless you could get credit for it? That  was the principle upon which he  always acted. 
  &quot;I suppose,&quot; continued Tom, &quot;this country cousin of mine wears  cowhide  boots and overalls, and has got rough, red hands like a common  laborer.  I wonder what Sam Paget would say if I should introduce such  a fellow to  him as my cousin. I rather guess he would not want to be  quite so  intimate with me as he is now.&quot; 
  If anything had been needed, this consideration would have been   sufficient to deter Mr. Stanton from sending for his nephew. He could   not permit the social standing of his family to be compromised by the   presence of a poor relation from the country, rough and unpolished as  he  doubtless was. 
  Maria, too, who had been for some time silent, here contributed to   strengthen the effect of Tom's words. 
  &quot;Yes,&quot; said she, &quot;and Laura Brooks, my most intimate friend, who is   shocked at anything vulgar or countrified&#8212;I wouldn't have her know  that  I have such a cousin&#8212;oh, not for the world!&quot; 
  &quot;There will be no occasion for it,&quot; said her father, decidedly. &quot;I  shall  write at once to this Dr. Kent, explaining to him my views and  wishes,  and how impossible it is for me to do as he so inconsiderately   suggests.&quot; 
  &quot;It's the wisest thing you can do, Mr. Stanton,&quot; said his wife, who  was  to the full as selfish as her husband. 
  &quot;What is his name, father?&quot; asked Maria. 
  &quot;Whose name?&quot; 
  &quot;The boy's.&quot; 
  &quot;Herbert Mason.&quot; 
  &quot;Herbert? I thought it might be Jonathan, or Zeke, or some such  name.  Herbert isn't at all countrified.&quot; 
  &quot;No,&quot; said Tom, slyly; &quot;of course not. We all know why you like  that  name.&quot; 
  &quot;Oh, you're mighty wise, Mr. Tom!&quot; retorted his sister. 
  &quot;It's because you like Herbert Dartmouth; but it isn't any use.  He's in  love with Lizzie Graves.&quot; 
  &quot;You seem to know all about it,&quot; said Maria, with vexation; for Tom  was  not far from right in speaking of her preference for Herbert  Dartmouth. 
  &quot;Of course I do,&quot; said Tom; &quot;I ought to, for he told me so  himself.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't believe it!&quot; said Maria, who looked ready to cry. 
  &quot;Well, you needn't; but it's so.&quot; 
  &quot;Be quiet, children,&quot; said Mrs. Stanton. &quot;Thomas, you mustn't  plague  your sister.&quot; 
  &quot;Don't take it so hard, Maria,&quot; said Tom, in rather an aggravating  tone.  &quot;There's other boys you could get. I guess you could get Jim  Gorham for  a beau, if you tried hard enough.&quot; 
  &quot;I wouldn't have him,&quot; said Maria. &quot;His face is all over freckles.&quot; 
  &quot;Enough of this quarreling, children,&quot; said Mrs. Stanton. &quot;I hope,&quot;  she  continued, addressing her husband, &quot;you won't fail to write at  once.  They might be sending on the boy, and then we should be in a  pretty  predicament.&quot; 
  &quot;I will write at once. I don't know but I ought to inclose some  money.&quot; 
  &quot;I don't see why you need to.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps I had better, as this is the last I intend to do for him.&quot; 
  &quot;At any rate, it won't be necessary to send much,&quot; said Mrs.  Stanton. 
  &quot;How much?&quot; 
  &quot;Five dollars will do, I should think. Because he happens to be  your  nephew, there is no good reason why he should be thrown upon you  for  support.&quot; 
  &quot;Perhaps it will be best to send ten dollars,&quot; said Mr. Stanton.  &quot;People  are unreasonable, you know, and they might charge me with  meanness, if I  sent less.&quot; 
  &quot;Then make it ten. It's only for once. I hope that will be the last  we  shall hear of him.&quot; 
  The room in which this conversation took place was a handsomely   furnished breakfast room, all the appointments of which spoke not only   of comfort, but of luxury. Mr. Stanton had been made rich by a series  of  lucky speculations, and he was at present carrying on a large  wholesale  store downtown. He had commenced with small means twenty  years before,  and for some years had advanced slowly, until the tide  of fortune set in  and made him rich. His present handsome residence he  had only occupied  three years, having moved to it from one of much  smaller pretensions on  Bleecker Street. Tom and Maria were forbidden  to speak of their former  home to their present fashionable  acquaintances, and this prohibition  they were likely to observe,  having inherited to the full the worldly  spirit which actuated their  parents. It will be seen that Herbert Mason  was little likely to be  benefited by having such prosperous relations.
