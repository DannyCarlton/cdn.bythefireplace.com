When Eustace Le Neve returned to lunch at Penmorgan that day he was  silent to his host about Trevennack of Trevennack. To say the truth,  he was so much attracted by Miss Cleer's appearance that he didn't  feel inclined to mention having met her. But he wanted to meet her  again for all that, and hoped he would do so. Perhaps Tyrrel might  know the family, and ask them round to dine some night. At any rate,  society is rare at the Lizard. Sooner or later, he felt sure, he'd  knock up against the mysterious stranger somewhere. And that involved  the probability of knocking up against the mysterious stranger's  beautiful daughter.    
Next morning after breakfast, however, he made a vigorous effort to  induce Walter Tyrrel to mount the cliff and look at the view from  Penmorgan Point toward the Rill and Kynance. It was absurd, he said  truly, for the proprietor of such an estate never to have seen the  most beautiful spot in it. But Tyrrel was obdurate. On the point of  actually mounting the cliff itself he wouldn't yield one jot or  tittle. Only, after much persuasion, he consented at last to cross the  headland by the fields at the back and come out at the tor above St.  Michael's Crag, provided always Eustace would promise he'd neither go  near the edge himself nor try to induce his friend to approach it.    
Satisfied with this lame compromise--for he really wished his host to  enjoy that glorious view--Eustace Le Neve turned up the valley behind  the house, with Walter Tyrrel by his side, and after traversing  several fields, through gaps in the stone walls, led out his companion  at last to the tor on the headland.    
As they approached it from behind, the engineer observed, not without  a faint thrill of pleasure, that Trevennack's stately figure stood  upright as before upon the wind-swept pile of fissured rocks, and that  Cleer sat reading under its shelter to leeward. But by her side this  morning sat also an elder lady, whom Eustace instinctively recognized  as her mother--a graceful, dignified lady, with silvery white hair and  black Cornish eyes, and features not untinged by the mellowing,  hallowing air of a great sorrow.    
Le Neve raised his hat as they drew near, with a pleased smile of  welcome, and Trevennack and his daughter both bowed in return. "A  glorious morning!" the engineer said, drinking in to the full the  lovely golden haze that flooded and half-obscured the Land's End  district; and Trevennack assented gravely. "The crag stands up well in  this sunshine against the dark water behind," he said, waving one  gracious hand toward the island at his foot, and poising lighter than  ever.    
"Oh, take care!" Walter Tyrrel cried, looking up at him, on  tenterhooks. It's so dangerous up there! You might tumble any minute."    
"<i>I</i> never tumble," Trevennack made answer with solemn gravity,  spreading one hand on either side as if to balance himself like an  acrobat. But he descended as he spoke and took his place beside them.    
Tyrrel looked at the view and looked at the pretty girl. It was  evident he was quite as much struck by the one as by the other.  Indeed, of the two, Cleer seemed to attract the larger share of his  attention. For some minutes they stood and talked, all five of them  together, without further introduction than their common admiration  for that exquisite bay, in which Trevennack appeared to take an almost  proprietary interest. It gratified him, obviously, a Cornish man, that  these strangers (as he thought them) should be so favorably impressed  by his native county. But Tyrrel all the while looked ill at ease,  though he sidled away as far as possible from the edge of the cliff,  and sat down near Cleer at a safe distance from the precipice. He was  silent and preoccupied. That mattered but little, however, as the rest  did all the talking, especially Trevennack, who turned out to be  indeed a perfect treasure-house of Cornish antiquities and Cornish  folk-lore.    
"I generally stand below, on top of Michael's Crag," he said to  Eustace, pointing it out, "when the tide allows it; but when it's  high, as it is now, such a roaring and seething scour sets through the  channel between the rock and the mainland that no swimmer could stem  it; and then I come up here, and look down from above upon it. It's  the finest point on all our Cornish coast, this point we stand on. It  has the widest view, the purest air, the hardest rock, the highest and  most fantastic tor of any of them."    
"My husband's quite an enthusiast for this particular place," Mrs.  Trevennack interposed, watching his face as she spoke with a certain  anxious and ill-disguised wifely solicitude.    
"He's come here for years. It has many associations for us."    
"Some painful and some happy," Cleer added, half aloud; and Tyrrel,  nodding assent, looked at her as if expecting some marked recognition.    
"You should see it in the pilchard season," her father went on,  turning suddenly to Eustace with much animation in his voice. "That's  the time for Cornwall--a month or so later than now--you should see it  then, for picturesqueness and variety. 'When the corn is in the  shock,' says our Cornish rhyme, 'Then the fish are off the rock'--and  the rock's St. Michael's. The <i>Huer</i>, as we call him, for he gives the  hue and cry from the hill-top lookout when the fish are coming, he  stands on Michael's Crag just below there, as I stand myself so often,  and when he sights the shoals by the ripple on the water, he motions  to the boats which way to go for the pilchards. Then the rowers in the  lurkers, as we call our seine-boats, surround the shoal with a tuck-  net, or drag the seine into Mullion Cove, all alive with a mass of  shimmering silver. The jowsters come down with their carts on to the  beach, and hawk them about round the neighborhood--I've seen them  twelve a penny; while in the curing-houses they're bulking them and  pressing them as if for dear life, to send away to Genoa, Leghorn, and  Naples. That's where all our fish go--to the Catholic south. 'The Pope  and the Pilchards,' says our Cornish toast; for it's the Friday fast  that makes our only market."    
"You can see them on St. George's Island in Looe Harbor," Cleer put in  quite innocently. "They're like a sea of silver there--on St. George's  Island."    
"My dear," her father corrected with that grave, old-fashioned  courtesy which the coast-guard had noted and described as at once so  haughty and yet so condescending, "how often I've begged of you <i>not</i> to  call it St. George's Island! It's St. Nicholas' and St. Michael's--one  may as well be correct--and till a very recent date a chapel to St.  Michael actually stood there upon the rocky top; it was only  destroyed, you remember, at the time of the Reformation."    
"Everybody <i>calls</i> it St. George's now," Cleer answered, with girlish  persistence. And her father looked round at her sharply, with an  impatient snap of the fingers, while Mrs. Trevennack's eye was fixed  on him now more carefully and more earnestly, Tyrrel observed, than  ever.    
"I wonder why it is," Eustace Le Neve interposed, to spare Cleer's  feelings, "that so many high places, tops of mountains and so forth,  seem always to be dedicated to St. Michael in particular? He seems to  love such airy sites. There's St. Michael's Mount here, you know, and  Mont St. Michel in Normandy; and at Le Puy, in Auvergne, there's a St.  Michael's Rock, and at ever so many other places I can't remember this  minute."    
Trevennack was in his element. The question just suited him. He smiled  a curious smile of superior knowledge. "You've come to the right place  for information," he said, blandly, turning round to the engineer.  "I'm a Companion of St. Michael and St. George myself, and my family,  as I told you, once owned St. Michael's Mount; so, for that and  various other reasons, I've made a special study of St. Michael the  Archangel, and all that pertains to him." And then he went on to give  a long and learned disquisition, which Le Neve and Walter Tyrrel only  partially followed, about the connection between St. Michael and the  Celtic race, as well as about the archangel's peculiar love for high  and airy situations. Most of the time, indeed, Le Neve was more  concerned in watching Cleer Trevennack's eyes, as her father spoke,  than in listening to the civil servant's profound dissertation. He  gathered, however, from the part he caught, that St. Michael the  Archangel had been from early days a very important and powerful  Cornish personage, and that he clung to high places on the tors and  rocks because he had to fight and subdue the Prince of the Air, whom  he always destroyed at last on some pointed pinnacle. And now that he  came to think of it, Eustace vaguely recollected he had always seen  St. Michael, in pictures or stained glass windows, delineated just so  --with drawn sword and warrior's mien--in the act of triumphing over  his dragon-like enemy on the airy summit of some tall jagged crag or  rock-bound precipice.    
As for Mrs. Trevennack, she watched her husband every moment he spoke  with a close and watchful care, which Le Neve hardly noticed, but  which didn't for a minute escape Walter Tyrrel's more piercing and  observant scrutiny.    
At last, as the amateur lecturer was beginning to grow somewhat  prolix, a cormorant below created a slight diversion for awhile by  settling in his flight on the very highest point of Michael's Crag,  and proceeding to preen his glittering feathers in the full golden  flood of that bright August sunlight.    
With irrepressible boyish instinct Le Neve took up a stone, and was  just on the point of aiming it (quite without reason) at the bird on  the pinnacle.    
But before he could let it go, the two other men, moved as if by a  single impulse, had sprung forward with a bound, and in the self-same  tone and in the self-same words cried out with one accord, in a wildly  excited voice, "For God's sake, don't throw! You don't know how  dangerous it is!"    
Le Neve let his hand drop flat, and allowed the stone to fall from it.  As he did so the two others stood back a pace, as if guarding him, but  kept their hands still ready to seize the engineer's arm if he made  the slightest attempt at motion. Eustace felt they were watching him  as one might watch a madman. For a moment they were silent. Trevennack  was the first to speak. His voice had an earnest and solemn ring in  it, like a reproving angel's. "How can you tell what precious life may  be passing below?" he said, with stern emphasis, fixing Le Neve with  his reproachful eye. "The stone might fall short. It might drop out of  sight. You might kill whomsoever it struck, unseen. And then"--he  drank in a deep breath, gasping--"you would know you were a murderer."    
Walter Tyrrel drew himself up at the words like one stung. "No, no!  not a murderer!" he cried; "not quite as bad as a murderer! It  wouldn't be murder, surely. It would be accidental homicide--  unintentional, unwilled--a terrible result of most culpable  carelessness, of course; but it wouldn't be quite murder; don't call  it murder. I can't allow that. Not that name by any means. . . .Though  to the end of your life, Eustace, if you were to kill a man so, you'd  never cease to regret it and mourn over it daily; you'd never cease to  repent your guilty carelessness in sackcloth and ashes."    
He spoke so seriously, so earnestly, with such depth of personal  feeling, that Trevennack, starting back, stood and gazed at him slowly  with those terrible eyes, like one who awakens by degrees from a  painful dream to some awful reality. Tyrrel winced before his  scrutiny. For a moment the elder man just looked at him and stared.  Then he took one step forward. "Sir," he said, in a very low voice,  half broken with emotion, "I had a dear son of my own once; a very  dear, dear son. He was killed by such an <i>accident</i> on this very spot.  No wonder I remember it."    
Mrs. Trevennack and Cleer both gave a start of surprise. The man's  words astonished them; for never before, during fifteen long years,  had that unhappy father alluded in any way in overt words to his son's  tragic end. He had brooded and mused over it in his crushed and  wounded spirit; he had revisited the scene of his loss whenever  opportunity permitted him; he had made of his sorrow a cherished and  petted daily companion; but he had stored it up deep in his own inmost  heart, never uttering a word of it even to his wife or daughter. The  two women knew Michael Trevennack must be profoundly moved, indeed, so  to tear open the half-healed wound in his tortured bosom before two  casual strangers.    
But Tyrrel, too, gave a start as he spoke, and looked hard at the  careworn face of that unhappy man. "Then you're Mr. Trevennack!" he  exclaimed, all aghast. "Mr. Trevennack of the Admiralty!"    
And the dignified stranger answered, bowing his head very low, "Yes,  you've guessed me right. I'm Michael Trevennack."    
With scarcely a word of reply Walter Tyrrel turned and strode away  from the spot. "I must go now," he muttered faintly, looking at his  watch with some feigned surprise, as a feeble excuse. "I've an  appointment at home." He hadn't the courage to stay. His heart misgave  him. Once fairly round the corner he fled like a wounded creature, too  deeply hurt even to cry. Eustace Le Neve, raising his hat, hastened  after him, all mute wonder. For several hundred yards they walked on  side by side across the open heathy moor. Then, as they passed the  first wall, Tyrrel paused for a moment and spoke. "<i>Not</i> a murderer!" he  cried in his anguish; "oh, no, not quite as bad as a murderer, surely,  Eustace; but still, a culpable homicide. Oh, God, how terrible."    
And even as he disappeared across the moor to eastward, Trevennack,  far behind, seized his wife's arm spasmodically, and clutching it  tight in his iron grip, murmured low in a voice of supreme conviction,  "Do you see what that means, Lucy? I can read it all now. It was <i>he</i>  who rolled down that cursed stone. It was <i>he</i> who killed our boy. And I  can guess who he is. He must be Tyrrel of Penmorgan."    
Cleer didn't hear the words. She was below, gazing after them.
