I'll not confer with Sorrow<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Till to-morrow;<br> But Joy shall have her way<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This very day. 
Ho, eglantine and cresses<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; For her tresses!--<br> Let Care, the beggar, wait<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Outside the gate. 
Tears if you will--but after<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mirth and laughter;<br> Then, folded hands on breast<br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; And endless rest.
