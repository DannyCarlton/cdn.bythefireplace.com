  Harry was doubly glad that he was now in receipt of a moderate  salary. He welcomed it as an evidence that he was rising in the  estimation of his employer, which was of itself satisfactory, and also  because in his circumstances the money was likely to be useful.
  &#8220;Five dollars a week!&#8221; said Harry to himself. &#8220;Half of that ought to  be enough to pay for my clothes and miscellaneous expenses, and the  rest I will give to father. It will help him take care of the rest of  the family.&#8221;
  Our hero at once made this proposal by letter. This is a paragraph  from his father's letter in reply:&#8212;
  &#8220;I am glad, my dear son, to find you so considerate and dutiful, as  your offer indicates. I have indeed had a hard time in supporting my  family, and have not always been able to give them the comforts I  desired. Perhaps it is my own fault in part. I am afraid I have not the  faculty of getting along and making money that many others have. But I  have had an unexpected stroke of good fortune. Last evening a letter  reached your mother, stating that her cousin Nancy had recently died at  St. Albans, Vermont, and that, in accordance with her will, your mother  is to receive a legacy of four thousand dollars. With your mother's  consent, one-fourth of this is to be devoted to the purchase of the ten  acres adjoining my little farm, and the balance will be so invested as  to yield us an annual income of one hundred and eighty dollars. Many  would think this a small addition to an income, but it will enable us  to live much more comfortably. You remember the ten-acre lot to the  east of us, belonging to the heirs of Reuben Todd. It is excellent  land, well adapted for cultivation, and will fully double the value of  my farm.
  &#8220;You see, therefore, my dear son, that a new era of prosperity has  opened for us. I am now relieved from the care and anxiety which for  years have oppressed me, and feel sure of a comfortable support.  Instead of accepting the half of your salary, I desire you, if  possible, to save it, depositing in some reliable savings institution.  If you do this every year till you are twenty-one, you will have a  little capital to start you in business, and will be able to lead a  more prosperous career than your father. Knowing you as well as I do, I  do not feel it necessary to caution you against unnecessary  expenditures. I will only remind you that extravagance is comparative,  and that what would be only reasonable expenditure for one richer than  yourself would be imprudent in you.&#8221;
  Harry read this letter with great joy. He was warmly attached to the  little home circle, and the thought that they were comparatively  provided for gave him fresh courage. He decided to adopt his father's  suggestion, and the very next week deposited three dollars in the  savings bank.
  &#8220;That is to begin an account,&#8221; he thought. &#8220;If I can only keep that  up, I shall feel quite rich at the end of a year.&#8221;
  Several weeks rolled by, and Thanksgiving approached.
  Harry was toiling at his case one day, when Oscar Vincent entered  the office.
  &#8220;Hard at work, I see, Harry,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Harry; &#8220;I can't afford to be idle.&#8221;
  &#8220;I want you to be idle for three days,&#8221; said Oscar.
  Harry looked up in surprise.
  &#8220;How is that?&#8221; he asked.
  &#8220;You know we have a vacation from Wednesday to Monday at the  Academy.&#8221;
  &#8220;Over Thanksgiving?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, I am going home to spend that time, and I want you to go with  me.&#8221;
  &#8220;What, to Boston?&#8221; asked Harry, startled, for to him, inexperienced  as he was, that seemed a very long journey.
  &#8220;Yes. Father and mother gave me permission to invite you. Shall I  show you the letter?&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll take it for granted, Oscar, but I am afraid I can't go.&#8221;
  &#8220;Nonsense! What's to prevent?&#8221;
  &#8220;In the first place, Mr. Anderson can't spare me.&#8221;
  &#8220;Ask him.&#8221;
  &#8220;What's that?&#8221; asked the editor, hearing his name mentioned.
  &#8220;I have invited Harry to spend the Thanksgiving vacation with me in  Boston, and he is afraid you can't spare him?&#8221;
  &#8220;Does your father sanction your invitation?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes, he wrote me this morning&#8212;that is, I got the letter this  morning&#8212;telling me to ask Harry to come.&#8221;
  Now the country editor had a great respect for the city editor, who  was indeed known by reputation throughout New England as a man of  influence and ability, and he felt disposed to accede to any request of  his.
  So he said pleasantly, &#8220;Of course, Harry, we shall miss you, but if  Mr. Ferguson is disposed to do a little additional work, we will get  along till Monday. What do you say, Mr. Ferguson?&#8221;
  &#8220;I shall be very glad to oblige Harry,&#8221; said the older workman, &#8220;and  I hope he will have a good time.&#8221;
  &#8220;That settles the question, Harry,&#8221; said Oscar, joyfully. &#8220;So all  you've got to do is to pack up and be ready to start to-morrow morning.  It's Tuesday, you know, already.&#8221;
  Harry hesitated, and Oscar observed it.
  &#8220;Well, what's the matter now?&#8221; he said; &#8220;out with it.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll tell you, Oscar,&#8221; said Harry, coloring a little. &#8220;Your father  is a rich man, and lives handsomely. I haven't any clothes good enough  to wear on a visit to your house.&#8221;
  &#8220;Oh, hang your clothes!&#8221; said Oscar, impetuously. &#8220;It isn't your  clothes we invite. It's yourself.&#8221;
  &#8220;Still, Oscar&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;Come, I see you think I am like Fitz Fletcher, after all. Say you  think me a snob, and done with it.&#8221;
  &#8220;But I don't,&#8221; said Harry, smiling.
  &#8220;Then don't make any more ridiculous objections. Don't you think  they are ridiculous, Mr. Ferguson?&#8221;
  &#8220;They wouldn't be in some places,&#8221; said Ferguson, &#8220;but here I think  they are out of place. I feel sure you are right, and that you value  Harry more than the clothes he wears.&#8221;
  &#8220;Well, Harry, do you surrender at discretion?&#8221; said Oscar. &#8220;You see  Ferguson is on my side.&#8221;
  &#8220;I suppose I shall have to,&#8221; said Harry, &#8220;as long as you are not  ashamed of me.&#8221;
  &#8220;None of that, Harry.&#8221;
  &#8220;I'll go.&#8221;
  &#8220;The first sensible words you've spoken this morning.&#8221;
  &#8220;I want to tell you how much I appreciate your kindness, Oscar,&#8221;  said Harry, earnestly.
  &#8220;Why shouldn't I be kind to my friend?&#8221;
  &#8220;Even if he was once a printer's devil.&#8221;
  &#8220;Very true. It is a great objection, but still I will overlook it.  By the way, there is one inducement I didn't mention.&#8221;
  &#8220;What is that?&#8221;
  &#8220;We may very likely see Fitz in the city. He is studying at home  now, I hear. Who knows but he may get up a great party in your honor?&#8221;
  &#8220;Do you think it likely?&#8221; asked Harry, smiling.
  &#8220;It might not happen to occur to him, I admit. Still, if we made him  a ceremonious call&#8212;&#8221;
  &#8220;I am afraid he might send word that he was not at home.&#8221;
  &#8220;That would be a loss to him, no doubt. However, we will leave time  to settle that question. Be sure to be on hand in time for the morning  train.&#8221;
  &#8220;All right, Oscar.&#8221;
  Harry had all the love of new scenes natural to a boy of sixteen. He  had heard so much of Boston that he felt a strong curiosity to see it.  Besides, was not that the city where the &#8220;Weekly Standard&#8221; was printed,  the paper in which he had already appeared as an author? In connection  with this, I must here divulge a secret of Harry's. He was ambitious  not only to contribute to the literary papers, but to be paid for his  contributions. He judged that essays were not very marketable, and he  had therefore in his leisure moments written a humorous sketch,  entitled &#8220;The Tin Pedler's Daughter.&#8221; I shall not give any idea of the  plot here; I will only say that it was really humorous, and did not  betray as much of the novice as might have been expected. Harry had  copied it out in his best hand, and resolved to carry it to Boston, and  offer it in person to the editor of the &#8220;Standard&#8221; with an effort, if  accepted, to obtain compensation for it.
