  With the slow approach of the storm which was advancing over the   wilderness, Carrigan felt more poignantly the growing unrest that  was  in him. He heard the last of St. Pierre's voice, and after  that the  fires on the distant shore died out slowly, giving way to  utter  blackness. Faintly there came to him the far-away rumbling  of thunder.  The air grew heavy and thick, and there was no sound  of night-bird  over the breast of the river, and out of the thick  cedar and spruce  and balsam there came no cry or whisper of the  nocturnal life waiting  in silence for the storm to break. In that  stillness David put out the  lights in the cabin and sat close to  the window in darkness. 
  He was more than sleepless. Every nerve in his body demanded   action, and his brain was fired by strange thoughts until their   vividness seemed to bring him face to face with a reality that set   his blood stirring with an irresistible thrill. He believed he had   made a discovery, that St. Pierre had betrayed himself. What he  had  visioned, the conclusion he had arrived at, seemed  inconceivable, yet  what his own eyes had seen and his ears had  heard pointed to the truth  of it all. The least he could say was  that St. Pierre's love for  Marie-Anne Boulain was a strange sort  of love. His attitude toward her  seemed more like that of a man in  the presence of a child of whom he  was fond in a fatherly sort of  way. His affection, as he had expressed  it, was parental and  careless. Not for an instant had there been in it  a betrayal of  the lover, no suggestion of the husband who cared deeply  or who  might be made jealous by another man. 
  Sitting in darkness thickening with the nearer approach of storm,   David recalled the stab of pain mingled with humiliation that had   come into the eyes of St. Pierre's wife when she had stood facing  her  husband. He heard again, with a new understanding, the low  note of  pathos in her voice as in song she had called upon the  Mother of  Christ to hear her&#8212;and help her. He had not guessed at  the tragedy of  it then. Now he knew, and he thought of her lying  awake in the gloom  beyond the bulkhead, her eyes were with tears.  And St. Pierre had gone  back to his raft, singing in the night!  Where before there had been  sympathy for him, there rose a sincere  revulsion. There had been a  reason for St. Pierre's masterly  possession of himself, and it had not  been, as he had thought,  because of his bigness of soul. It was  because he had not cared.  He was a splendid hypocrite, playing his  game well at the  beginning, but betraying the lie at the end. He did  not love  Marie-Anne as he, Dave Carrigan, loved her. He had spoken of  her  as a child, and he had treated her as a child, and was serenely   dispassionate in the face of a situation which would have roused  the  spirit in most men. And suddenly, recalling that thrilling  hour in the  white strip of sand and all that had happened since,  it flashed upon  David that St. Pierre was using his wife as the  vital moving force in  a game of his own&#8212;that under the masquerade  of his apparent faith and  bigness of character he was sacrificing  her to achieve a certain  mysterious something it the scheme of his  own affairs. 
  Yet he could not forget the infinite faith Marie-Anne Boulain had   expressed in her husband. There had been no hypocrisy in her  waiting  and her watching for him, or in her belief that he would  straighten  out the tangles of the dilemma in which she had become  involved. Nor  had there been make-believe in the manner she had  left him that day in  her eagerness to go to St. Pierre. Adding  these facts as he had added  the others, he fancied he saw the  truth staring at him out of the  darkness of his cabin room. Marie-  Anne loved her husband. And St.  Pierre was merely the possessor,  careless and indifferent, almost  brutally dispassionate in his  consideration of her. 
  A heavy crash of thunder brought Carrigan back to a realization of   the impending storm. He rose to his feet in the chaotic gloom,  facing  the bulkhead beyond which he was certain St. Pierre's wife  lay wide  awake. He tried to laugh. It was inexcusable, he told  himself, to let  his thoughts become involved in the family affairs  of St. Pierre and  Marie-Anne. That was not his business. Marie-  Anne, in the final  analysis, did not appear to be especially  abused, and her mind was not  a child's mind. Probably she would  not thank him for his interest in  the matter. She would tell him,  like any other woman with pride, that  it was none of his business  and that he was presuming upon forbidden  ground. 
  He went to the window. There was scarcely a breath of air, and   unfastening the screen, he thrust out his head and shoulders into  the  night. It was so black that he could not see the shadow of the  water  almost within reach of his hands, but through the chaos of  gloom that  lay between him and the opposite shore he made out a  single point of  yellow light. He was positive the light was in the  cabin on the raft.  And St. Pierre was probably in that cabin. 
  A huge drop of rain splashed on his hand, and behind him he heard   sweeping over the forest tops the quickening march of the deluge.   There was no crash of thunder or flash of lightning when it broke.   Straight down, in an inundation, it came out of a sky thick enough  to  slit with a knife. Carrigan drew in his head and shoulders and  sniffed  the sweet freshness of it. He tried again to make out the  light on the  raft, but it was obliterated. 
  Mechanically he began taking off his clothes, and in a few moments   he stood again at the window, naked. Thunder and lightning had  caught  up with the rain, and in the flashes of fire Carrigan's  ghost-white  face stared in the direction of the raft. In his veins  was at work an  insistent and impelling desire. Over there was St.  Pierre, he was  undoubtedly in the cabin, and something might  happen if he, Dave  Carrigan, took advantage of storm and gloom to  go to the raft. 
  It was almost a presentiment that drew his bare head and shoulders   out through the window, and every hunting instinct in him urged  him  to the adventure. The stygian darkness was torn again by a  flash of  fire. In it he saw the river and the vivid silhouette of  the distant  shore. It would not be a difficult swim, and it would  be good training  for tomorrow. 
  Like a badger worming his way out of a hole a bit too small for   him, Carrigan drew himself through the window. A lightning flash   caught him at the edge of the bateau, and he slunk back quickly   against the cabin, with the thought that other eyes might be  staring  out into that same darkness. In the pitch gloom that  followed he  lowered himself quietly into the river, thrust himself  under water,  and struck out for the opposite shore. 
  When he came to the surface again it was in the glare of another   lightning flash. He flung the water from his face, chose a point   several hundred yards above the raft, and with quick, powerful   strokes set out in its direction. For ten minutes he quartered the   current without raising his head. Then he paused, floating   unresistingly with the slow sweep of the river, and waited for   another illumination. When it came, he made out the tented raft   scarcely a hundred yards away and a little below him. In the next   darkness he found the edge of it and dragged himself up on the  mass  of timbers. 
  The thunder had been rolling steadily westward, and David crouched   low, hoping for one more flash to illumine the raft. It came at  last  from a mass of inky cloud far to the west, so indistinct that  it made  only dim shadows out of the tents and shelters, but it was  sufficient  to give him direction. Before its faint glare died out,  he saw the  deeper shadow of the cabin forward. 
  For many minutes he lay where he had dragged himself, without   making a movement in its direction. Nowhere about him could he see  a  sign of light, nor could he hear any sound of life. St. Pierre's   people were evidently deep in slumber. 
  Carrigan had no very definite idea of the next step in his   adventure. He had swum from the bateau largely under impulse, with  no  preconceived scheme of action, urged chiefly by the hope that  he would  find St. Pierre in the cabin and that something might  come of it. As  for knocking at the door and rousing the chief of  the Boulains from  sleep&#8212;he had at the present moment no very good  excuse for that. No  sooner had the thought and its objection come  to him than a broad  shaft of light shot with startling suddenness  athwart the blackness of  the raft, darkened in another instant by  an obscuring shadow. Swift as  the light itself David's eyes turned  to the source of the unexpected  illumination. The door of St.  Pierre's cabin was wide open. The  interior was flooded with  lampglow, and in the doorway stood St.  Pierre himself. 
  The chief of the Boulains seemed to be measuring the weather   possibilities of the night. His subdued voice reached David,   chuckling with satisfaction, as he spoke to some one who was  behind  him in the cabin. 
  &quot;Pitch and brimstone, but it's black!&quot; he cried. &quot;You could carve   it with a knife, and stand it on end, AMANTE. But it's going west.  In  a few hours the stars will be out.&quot; 
  He drew back into the cabin, and the door closed. David held his   breath in amazement, staring at the blackness where a moment  before  the light had been. Who was it St. Pierre had called  sweetheart?  AMANTE! He could not have been mistaken. The word had  come to him  clearly, and there was but one guess to make. Marie-  Anne was not on  the bateau. She had played him for a fool, had  completely hoodwinked  him in her plot with St. Pierre. They were  cleverer than he had  supposed, and in darkness she had rejoined  her husband on the raft!  But why that senseless play of falsehood?  What could be their object  in wanting him to believe she was still  aboard the bateau? 
  He stood up on his feet and mopped the warm rain from his face,   while the gloom hid the grim smile that came slowly to his lips.   Close upon the thrill of his astonishment he felt a new stir in  his  blood which added impetus to his determination and his action.  He was  not disgusted with himself, nor was he embittered by what  he had  thought of a moment ago as the lying hypocrisy of his  captors. To be  beaten in his game of man-hunting was sometimes to  be expected, and  Carrigan always gave proper credit to the  winners. It was also &quot;good  medicine&quot; to know that Marie-Anne,  instead of being an unhappy and  neglected wife, had blinded him  with an exquisitely clever simulation.  Just why she had done it,  and why St. Pierre had played his  masquerade, it was his duty now  to find out. 
  An hour ago he would have cut off a hand before spying upon St.   Pierre's wife or eavesdropping under her window. Now he felt no   uneasiness of conscience as he approached the cabin, for Marie-  Anne  herself had destroyed all reason for any delicate  discrimination on  his part. 
  The rain had almost stopped, and in one of the near tents he heard   a sleepy voice. But he had no fear of chance discovery. The night   would remain dark for a long time, and in his bare feet he made no   sound the sharpest ears of a dog ten feet away might have heard.   Close to the cabin door, yet in such a way that the sudden opening  of  it would not reveal him, he paused and listened. 
  Distinctly he heard St. Pierre's voice, but not the words. A   moment later came the soft, joyous laughter of a woman, and for an   instant a hand seemed to grip David's heart, filling it with pain.   There was no unhappiness in that laughter. It seemed, instead, to   tremble in an exultation of gladness. 
  Suddenly St. Pierre came nearer the door, and his voice was more   distinct. &quot;Chere-coeur, I tell you it is the greatest joke of my   life,&quot; he heard him say. &quot;We are safe. If it should come to the   worst, we can settle the matter in another way. I can not but sing   and laugh, even in the face of it all. And she, in that very   innocence which amuses me so, has no suspicion&#8212;&quot; 
  He turned, and vainly David keyed his ears to catch the final   words. The voices in the cabin grew lower. Twice he heard the soft   laughter of the woman. St. Pierre's voice, when he spoke, was   unintelligible. 
  The thought that his random adventure was bringing him to an   important discovery possessed Carrigan. St. Pierre, he believed,  had  been on the very edge of disclosing something which he would  have  given a great deal to know. Surely in this cabin there must  be a  window, and the window would be open&#8212; 
  Quietly he felt his way through the darkness to the shore side of   the cabin. A narrow bar of light at least partly confirmed his   judgment. There was a window. But it was almost entirely  curtained,  and it was closed. Had the curtain been drawn two  inches lower, the  thin stream of light would have been shut  entirely out from the night. 
  Under this window David crouched for several minutes, hoping that   in the calm which was succeeding the storm it might be opened. The   voices were still more indistinct inside. He scarcely heard St.   Pierre, but twice again he heard the low and musical laughter of  the  woman. She had laughed differently with HIM&#8212;and the grim  smile  settled on his lips as he looked up at the narrow slit of  light over  his head. He had an overwhelming desire to look in.  After all, it was  a matter of professional business&#8212;and his duty. 
  He was glad the curtain was drawn so low. From experiments of his   own he knew there was small chance of those inside seeing him  through  the two-inch slit, and he raised himself boldly until his  eyes were on  a level with the aperture. 
  Directly in the line of his vision was St. Pierre's wife. She was   seated, and her back was toward him, so he could not see her face.   She was partly disrobed, and her hair was streaming loose about  her.  Once, he remembered, she had spoken of fiery lights that came  into her  hair under certain illumination. He had seen them in the  sun, but  never as they revealed themselves now in that cabin lamp  glow. He  scarcely looked at St. Pierre, who was on his feet,  looking down upon  her&#8212;not until St. Pierre reached out and  crumpled the smothering mass  of glowing tresses in his big hands,  and laughed. It was a laugh  filled with the unutterable joy of  possession. The woman rose to her  feet. Up through her hair went  her two white, bare arms, encircling  St. Pierre's neck. The giant  drew her close. Her slim form seemed to  melt in his, and their  lips met. 
  And then the woman threw back her head, laughing, so that her   glory of hair fell straight down, and she was out of reach of St.   Pierre's lips. They turned. Her face fronted the window, and out  in  the night Carrigan stifled a cry that almost broke from his  lips. For  a flash he was looking straight into her eyes. Her  parted lips seemed  smiling at him; her white throat and bosom were  bared to him. He  dropped down, his heart choking him as he  stumbled through the  darkness to the edge of the raft. There, with  the lap of the water at  his feet, he paused. It was hard for him  to get Breath. He stared  through the gloom in the direction of the  bateau. Marie-Anne Boulain,  the woman he loved, was there! In her  little cabin, alone, on the  bateau, was St. Pierre's wife, her  heart crushed. 
  And in this cabin on the raft, forgetful of her degradation and   her grief, was the vilest wretch he had ever known&#8212;St. Pierre   Boulain. And with him, giving herself into his arms, caressing him   with her lips and hair, was the sister of the man he had helped to   hang&#8212;CARMIN FANCHET!
