The great masses of rock on the ocean's coast shone white in the  moonlight. Through the gaunt outlying rocks, lashed apart by furious  storms, boiled the ponderous breakers, tossing aloft the sparkling  clouds of spray, breaking in the pools like a million silver fishes.  High above the waves, growing out of the crevices of the massive rocks  of the shore, were weird old cypresses, their bodies bent from the  ocean as if petrified in flight before the mightier foe. On their gaunt  outstretched arms and gray bodies, seamed with time, knobs like human  muscles jutted; between the broken bark the red blood showed. From  their angry hands, clutching at the air or doubled in imprecation, long  strands of gray-green moss hung, waving and coiling, in the night wind.  Only one old man was on his hands and knees as if to crawl from the  field; but a comrade spurned him with his foot and wound his bony hand  about the coward's neck. Another had turned his head to the enemy,  pointing his index finger in scorn, although he stood alone on high.    
All along the cliffs ran the ghostly army, sometimes with straining  arms fighting the air, sometimes thrust blankly outward, all with life  quivering in their arrested bodies, silent and scornful in their defeat.  Who shall say what winter winds first beat them, what great waves first  fought their deathless trunks, what young stars first shone over them?  They have outstood centuries of raging storm and rending earthquake.  Tradition says that until convulsion wrenched the Golden Gate apart the  San Franciscan waters rolled through the long valleys and emptied into  the Bay of Monterey. But the old cypresses were on the ocean just  beyond; the incoming and the outgoing of the inland ocean could not  trouble them; and perhaps they will stand there until the end of time.    
Down the long road by the ocean rode a gay cavalcade. The caballeros had  haughtily refused to join the party, and the men wore the blue and gold  of the United States.    
But the women wore fluttering mantillas, and their prancing  high-stepping horses were trapped with embossed leather and silver. In a  lumbering "wagon of the country," drawn by oxen, running on solid wheels  cut from the trunks of trees, but padded with silk, rode some of the  older people of the town, disapproving, but overridden by the impatient  enthusiasm of Dona Eustaquia. Through the pine woods with their softly  moving shadows and splendid aisles, out between the cypresses and rocky  beach, wound the stately cavalcade, their voices rising above the  sociable converse of the seals and the screeching of the seagulls  spiking the rocks where the waves fought and foamed. The gold on the  shoulders of the men flashed in the moonlight; the jewels of the women  sparkled and winked. Two by two they came like a conquering army to the  rescue of the cypresses. Brotherton, who rode ahead with Dona Eustaquia,  half expected to see the old trees rise upright with a deep shout of  welcome.    
When they reached a point where the sloping rocks rose high above surf  and spray, they dismounted, leaving the Indian servants to tether the  horses. They climbed down the big smooth rocks and sat about in groups,  although never beyond the range of older eyes, the cypresses lowering  above them, the ocean tearing through the outer rocks to swirl and  grumble in the pools. The moon was so bright, its light so broad and  silver, they almost could imagine they saw the gorgeous mass of colour  in the pools below.    
"You no have seaweed like that in Boston," said Benicia, who had a  comprehensive way of symbolizing the world by the city from which she  got many of her clothes and all of her books.    
"Indeed, no!" said Russell. "The other day I sat for hours watching  those great bunches and strands that look like richly coloured chenille.  And there were stones that looked like big opals studded with vivid  jewels. God of my soul, as you say, it was magnificent! I never saw such  brilliant colour, such delicate tints! And those great rugged defiant  rocks out there, lashed by the waves! Look at that one; misty with spray  one minute, bare and black the next! They look like an old castle which  has been battered down with cannon. Captain, do you not feel romantic?"    
"I feel that I never want to go into an art gallery again. No wonder the  women of California are original."    
"Benicia," said Russell, "I have tried in vain to learn a Spanish song.  But teach me a Spanish phrase of endearment. All our 'darlings' and  'dearests' are too flat for California."    
"Bueno; I teach you. Say after me: Mi muy querida prima. That is very  sweet. Say."    
"Mi muy--"    
"Querida prima."    
"Que--What is it in English?"    
"My--very--darling--first. It no sound so pretty in English."    
"It does very well. My--very--darling--first--if all these people were  not about us, I should kiss you. You look exactly like a flower."    
"Si you did, Senor Impertinencio, you get that for thanks."    
Russell jumped to his feet with a shout, and shook from his neck a  little crab with a back like green velvet and legs like carven garnet.    
"Did you put that crab on my neck, senorita?"    
"Si, senor."    
A sulky silence of ten minutes ensued, during which Benicia sent little  stones skipping down into the silvered pools, and Russell, again  recumbent, stared at the horizon.    
"Si you no can talk," she said finally, "I wish you go way and let Don  Henry Tallant come talk to me. He look like he want."    
"No doubt he does; but he can stay where he is. Let me kiss your hand,  Benicia, and I will forgive you."    
Benicia hit his mouth lightly with the back of her hand, but he captured  it and kissed it several times.    
"Your mustache feels like the cat's," said she.    
He flung the hand from him, but laughed in a moment. "How sentimental  you are! Making love to you is like dragging a cannon uphill! Will you  not at least sing me a love-song? And please do not make faces in the  tender parts."    
Benicia tossed her spirited head, but took her guitar from its case and  called to the other girls to accompany her. They withdrew from their  various flirtations with audible sighs, but it was Benicia's merienda,  and in a moment a dozen white hands were sweeping the long notes from  the strings.    
Russell moved to a lower rock, and lying at Benicia's feet looked  upward. The scene was all above him--the great mass of white rocks,  whiter in the moonlight; the rigid cypresses aloft; the beautiful faces,  dreamy, passionate, stolid, restless, looking from the lace mantillas;  the graceful arms holding the guitars; the sweet rich voices threading  through the roar of the ocean like the melody in a grand recitativo; the  old men and women crouching like buzzards on the stones, their sharp  eyes never closing; enfolding all with an almost palpable touch, the  warm voluptuous air. Now and again a bird sang a few notes, a strange  sound in the night, or the soft wind murmured like the ocean's echo  through the pines.    
The song finished. "Benicia, I love you," whispered Russell.    
"We will now eat," said Benicia. "Mamma,"--she raised her voice,--"shall  I tell Raphael to bring down the supper?"    
"Yes, nina."    
The girl sprang lightly up the rocks, followed by Russell. The Indian  servants were some distance off, and as the young people ran through a  pine grove the bold officer of the United States squadron captured the  Californian and kissed her on the mouth. She boxed his ears and escaped  to the light.    
Benicia gave her orders, Raphael and the other Indians followed her with  the baskets, and spread the supper of tomales and salads, dulces and  wine, on a large table-like rock, just above the threatening spray; the  girls sang each in turn, whilst the others nibbled the dainties Dona  Eustaquia had provided, and the Americans wondered if it were not a  vision that would disappear into the fog bearing down upon them.    
A great white bank, writhing and lifting, rolling and bending, came  across the ocean slowly, with majestic stealth, hiding the swinging  waves on which it rode so lightly, shrouding the rocks, enfolding the  men and women, wreathing the cypresses, rushing onward to the pines.    
"We must go," said Dona Eustaquia, rising. "There is danger to stay. The  lungs, the throat, my children. Look at the poor old cypresses."    
The fog was puffing through the gaunt arms, festooning the rigid hands.  It hung over the green heads, it coiled about the gray trunks. The stern  defeated trees looked like the phantoms of themselves, a long silent  battalion of petrified ghosts. Even Benicia's gay spirit was oppressed,  and during the long ride homeward through the pine woods she had little  to say to her equally silent companion.
