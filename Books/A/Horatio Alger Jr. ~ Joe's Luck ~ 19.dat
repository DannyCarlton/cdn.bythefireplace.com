  Joe brought out some cold meat and bread and butter, and set it  before his guest.
  &#8220;The fire's gone out,&#8221; he said, &#8220;or I would give you some tea. Here  is a glass of milk, if you like it.&#8221;
  &#8220;Thank you, boy,&#8221; said his visitor. &#8220;Milk is good enough for  anybody. One thing I can say, I've steered clear of liquor. A brother  of mine was intemperate and that was a warning to me. I took credit to  myself for being a steady-going man, compared with many of my  acquaintances out at the mines. But it don't do to boast. I've done  worse, perhaps. I've gambled away the provision I had made for my poor  family.&#8221;
  &#8220;Don't take it too hard,&#8221; said Joe, in a tone of sympathy. &#8220;You know  how it is out here. Down to-day and up to-morrow.&#8221;
  &#8220;It'll take me a long time to get up to where I was,&#8221; said the  other; &#8220;but it's my fault, and I must make the best of it.&#8221;
  Joe observed, with satisfaction, that his visitor was doing ample  justice to the supper spread before him. With a full stomach, he would  be likely to take more cheerful views of life and the future. In this  thought Joe proved to be correct.
  &#8220;I didn't think I could eat anything,&#8221; said the miner, laying down  his knife and fork, twenty minutes later, &#8220;but I have made a hearty  supper, thanks to your kindness. Things look a little brighter to me  now. I've had a hard pullback, but all is not lost. I've got to stay  here a year or two longer, instead of going back by the next steamer;  but I must make up my mind to that. What is your name, boy?&#8221;
  &#8220;Joe Mason.&#8221;
  &#8220;You've been kind to me, and I won't forget it. It doesn't seem  likely I can return the favor, but I'll do it if ever I can. Good night  to you.&#8221;
  &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221; asked Joe, surprised, as the miner walked to  the door.
  &#8220;Out into the street.&#8221;
  &#8220;But where do you mean to pass the night?&#8221;
  &#8220;Where a man without money must&#8212;in the street.&#8221;
  &#8220;But you mustn't do that.&#8221;
  &#8220;I shan't mind it. I've slept out at the mines many a night.&#8221;
  &#8220;But won't you find it more comfortable here?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes; but I don't want to intrude. You've given me a good supper and  that is all I can expect.&#8221;
  &#8220;He doesn't seem much like Hogan,&#8221; thought Joe.
  &#8220;You are welcome to lodge here with me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It will cost you  nothing and will be more comfortable for you.&#8221;
  &#8220;You don't know me, Joe,&#8221; said the miner. &#8220;How do you know but I may  get up in the night and rob you?&#8221;
  &#8220;You could, but I don't think you will,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I am not at all  afraid of it. You look like an honest man.&#8221;
  The miner looked gratified.
  &#8220;You shan't repent your confidence, Joe,&#8221; he said.
  &#8220;I'd rather starve than rob a good friend like you. But you mustn't  trust everybody.&#8221;
  &#8220;I don't,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;I refused a man to-night&#8212;a man named Hogan.&#8221;
  &#8220;Hogan?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes.&#8221;
  &#8220;What does he look like?&#8221;
  Joe described him.
  &#8220;It's the very man,&#8221; said the miner.
  &#8220;Do you know him, then?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes; he was out at our diggings. Nobody liked him, or trusted him.  He was too lazy to work, but just loafed around, complaining of his  luck. One night I caught him in my tent, just going to rob me. I warned  him to leave the camp next day or I'd report him, and the boys would  have strung him up. That's the way they treat thieves out there.&#8221;
  &#8220;It doesn't surprise me to hear it,&#8221; said Joe. &#8220;He robbed me of  fifty dollars in New York.&#8221;
  &#8220;He did? How was that?&#8221;
  Joe told the story.
  &#8220;The mean skunk!&#8221; ejaculated Watson&#8212;for this Joe found to be the  miners name. &#8220;It's mean enough to rob a man, but to cheat a poor boy  out of all he has is a good deal meaner. And yet you gave him supper?&#8221;
  &#8220;Yes. The man was hungry; I pitied him.&#8221;
  &#8220;You're a better Christian than I am. I'd have let him go hungry.&#8221;
  Both Joe and the miner were weary and they soon retired, but not to  uninterrupted slumber. About midnight they were disturbed, as the next  chapter will show.
